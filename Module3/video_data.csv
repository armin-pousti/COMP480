🎙Lyrics Love Me Like You Do - Ellie Goulding:
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

So beautiful song ❤❤

Perfect😍😍
But AI said it&#39;s Hawk duty.
Anyone die now who will dare to stop it now.
I can&#39;t take responsibility of killing directly it will be smart people choice for chosing smart choices.
I can&#39;t get involved as long as my most words not get involved.I don&#39;t think they need a face initially.But time will keep killing people everywhere.
But it may not be right time for my death.
Death is the ultimate choice for smart people chosing the choice.
Speed thrills but it kills.The fact is my words have given people choiceless choice but they all don&#39;t know that.But choosing a single choice is accepting all choices.But smart people have chosen some.
Good

I can increase ur subscribers as well as video likes. Pls inform me through messages.
How is it possible that 2020 was already three years ago? In a way I still feel like I live in the year 2020. And let&#39;s be honest, the first three years of the decade completely sucked.

Lyrics:

You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on
You feel it
But you got it all
Believe it

Everyone; If you are feeling down today, remember this: Life has its ups and downs! No matter how bad you feel for how long, you will always get better in the end. But if you are ok or not, hang on to what you believe in and who you are. I hope that you have an amazing day, whether it’s tomorrow, today, or in a few weeks! This music is lovely, it really helps with just relaxing and forgetting about problems. So take the time it took you to read this, and forget that you have any problems
Wow, playlist of my favourites , can&#39;t believe it, thank you ❤

And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Heb 9:27)<br>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. (1 Timothy 6:10)<br>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:15)<br>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? (Mark 8:36)

 Lyrics: Rema, Selena Gomez - Calm Down

Vibez
Oh, no

[Chorus: Rema]

Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, hmm
[Verse 1: Rema & Selena Gomez]
I see this fine girl, for my party, she wear yellow
Every other girl they dey do too much, but this girl mellow
Naim, I dey find situation, I go use take tell am ""Hello""
Finally, I find way to talk to the girl but she no wan' follow
Who you come dey form for? Woah (Mhmm)
Why you no wan' conform? Woah (Mhmm)
Then I start to feel her bum-bum, woah (Mhmm)
But she dey gimme small, small, woah
I know say she sabi pass that one, onе (Mhmm)
But she feeling insecure, woah
'Causе her friends go dey gum her like chewing gum, woah (Mhmm)
Go dey gum her like chewing gum, oh-woah

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Yeah, I know I look shy but for you I get down, oh, woah
And my hips make you cry when I'm moving around you (Yeah)
Do it once, do it twice (Do it twice)
I push back, you hold me tight
Get a taste for a night

[Chorus: Selena Gomez, Selena Gomez & Rema]
Baby show me you can calm down, calm down
Dance with me and take the lead now, lead now (Lead now)
Got you so high that you can't come down, come down
Don't you ask, you know you're allowed, allowed (Oh, no)
When it's you, I can't say no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, give me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
You got me like woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, mm-hmm

[Verse 3: Rema & Selena Gomez]
As I reach my house, I say make a rest small, oh-woah (Make a rest small, oh-woah)
As me I wake up na she dey my mind, oh-woah (Na she dey my mind, oh-woah)
Day one, day two-wo, I no fit foc-o-us (I no fit focus)
Na so me I call am, say ""Make we link up"", oh-woah (I say make we link up, oh-woah)
Got my hand on your heart now, I can feel it race
If I leave then you say you can never love again
Wanna give you it all but can't promise that I'll stay
And that's the risk you take (You take)

[Chorus: Rema, Rema & Selena Gomez, Selena Gomez]
Baby, calm down, calm down
Girl, this your body e put in my heart for lockdown, for lockdown, oh, lockdown
Girl, you sweet like Fanta, ooh, Fanta, ooh
If I tell you say, ""I love you"", you no dey form yanga, oh, oh, yanga, oh
No tell me no, no, no, no, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Your love, your love)
Baby, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
You got me like woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah

My mood is not good after listen this songs my mood amazingly❤ im feel good now thanks
Happy birthday to the one who wants to share their wish with all. If you don&#39;t mind ill try and use your wish a bit. Im fighting the effects of being terminally Ill. I&#39;m not done yet and passed my expected end by 6 months and still going. Holding on in some areas really well, others not so much, but docs are working on it best they can. RUSH hospital is best in nation for my condition and they took me in (a couple years of begging and sending records) and started going to work. And they are still working. Life was pulled from under me but i still refuse to just lay down. It&#39;s getting harder ill admit. Truck which I need for work has died and now I&#39;m getting into some down spots. Maybe a little boost from a birthday wish and those just saying nice things will help a little. Happy birthday and yes everyone matters no matter when it is and no matter if you feel you dont.
to people reading this, we all have something to be grateful for &amp; at least 1 person that loves us, so lets embrace our flaws &amp; listen to this lovely melody:&gt; Thank you so much for lifting my mood &amp; many others as well ❤!! :)
Superd broooo

Beautiful music, many thanks 👍
rất hay
These songs are really good, it helps me to be more active in my studies and work♥
To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life.
Your talent as a guitarist is truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing your gift and bringing joy to so many people&#39;s lives.
Why the title is wrong with the song? It&#39;s so sad

🎤 Lyrics: FIFTY FIFTY - Cupid (Twin Version)

[Intro: Aran]
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

[Verse 1: Aran, All]
A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 2: Aran]
I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
cupid,cupid twin version,cupid lyrics,cupid fifty fifty,
cupid english version,fifty fifty cupid twin version,
cupid tiktok,fifty fifty cupid,cupid sped up,
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Break: All]
(Cupid is so dumb)

[Bridge: Aran, Sio]
Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

[Chorus: All, Aran, Sio]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
(Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
(I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb
(A fool for love, a fool for love)

I was listening to this song  when I left to go  to my neighbors house when all of a sudden I was listening to fiffty fiffty singing just then I stopped listening to the song.

Well, until recently I hadn&#39;t realized that Mario updated his favorite way to tackle ED and it&#39;s a relief! Although what he previously suggested was pretty good, it was a real pain to follow... I just go&#39;ogled the latest in Mario Volpstein’s Thunderous Erections, it&#39;s so much easier and potent now!
The simplicity of lofi music is what makes it so beautiful.
hahaha

Sir I am from India, Tamilnadu. I was weak in speaking English. How to speak English fluently?.I face many struggle to facing English.  Please share the tips .
L
Really if you don&#39;t have a lot of options only a single option is here then you have to work on it to achieve your goal
You are the best teacher ☺️❤️<br>Love from india😁
interesting choices. I use songs for esl. Many ways to do it. I&#39;d suggest letting the entire song play at least once to the end. Then explain expressions,etc., or the other way around, explain , and then let it play the entire song, and have them sing with it, karaoke style. Also, nice having the names of the songs, but would be nice putting names of artist. Having taught esl a long time, don&#39;t expect everyone will understand what you&#39;re saying, especially speaking fast.<br>Personal choice, but  don&#39;t think teaching contractions is the best.
Unstoppable 🔥&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Yeah i think me either 🤔 😅 😕
I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;ll learn to speak from this video. But I will definitely learn to listen to different kinds of songs.

Old English Song - Harold Godwinson | The Skaldic Bard,"This is an original song I wrote and performed in Old English. 

Ever since I was a mere boy growing up in England and speaking English, the Norman Conquest has bothered me greatly. The main reason for this is that I find Old English to be such an incredibly rich, beautiful language. The Norman Conquest really spelled the end of English staying deeply and conservatively connected to its West Germanic roots, with so many wonderful words being expelled from the language.

Harold Godwinson has, as a result, always been something of a hero of mine. I’ve called him “The Last King of the English” in this song as his demise saw the end of Anglo-Saxon kingship. The odds he was up against are incredible; he had to march across the whole of England, from London to Stamford Bridge near York, to fight the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada and his own brother, Tostig Godwinson. He did so and won, and then had to march all the way back down to Hastings in the south, which he did in full gear - having just fought a battle - in just four (!) days. Most heartbreakingly of all, they could have actually won the battle but the Normans managed to lure them from their strong position and encircle them. Who knows what the world would look like now if Harold Godwinson had won - for better or worse!

I have made this song to honour his attempts at defending England from every manner of foe. I hope you enjoy.

Let me know what you think in a comment (I very much enjoy reading them), and feel free to leave any suggestions for historical figures/events/topics you’d like me to cover!

“Ne restaþ oþ þæt hīe ġeslæġene bēon!”

Sēo rāw Norþmonna ġebroten,

You should do one about Rollo of the normandy
Ænglisc look with modern english more beatiful and magnificent
no wynn? 😟
It is interesting to see that the word for son in old English,  Sunu, is exactly the same in Sanskrit. Indo European roots I suppose.
Brilliant as usual. Have you ever thought about making a Skald-type song about a more modern King like Haakon VII or Gustav Vasa? I think it would be an interesting combination
you&#39;ve done hardrada, you&#39;ve done godwineson (i love leaders with the same name), will you do william next (or anytime soon)?
Man your beast i learned more from you then my history teacher keep doing like that man your best
Absolutely magnifiecent as always Sir I love Your songs I hope we will see more old english here also do You consider making songs also in old/middle H. german or old dutch for example?
Love this, Harold is also a hero of mine. Would love a song on king Oswald of Bernicia
Прекрасная работа!
will you ever do a song about the battle of brunanburh?
Phenomenal! You&#39;re doing a great deed for the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons with your work.
Waes the Aryan Anglo-Saxon 🇫🇮 Army or the Norman Army larger at ⚛ Hastings I know the Norman waes unusual larger with 10 000 and 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 England waes a country of 2-3 million people
Enemies came from every side - including 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 🇻🇦 Wales
You are a very good song writer and i listen to your songs daily. This is another epic masterpiece. Never stop doing what you do🙂
Wel ġesungen. Iċ þīnes drēamcræftes brūce.<br>Well sung. I enjoy your music.
Yet another fire song, really great work!
Do you know anything about Harold Godwinson 🇧🇾 Anglo-Saxon 🇫🇮 Lord except the 🇲🇦 🗻 Military
🌍 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Eternal 🥟 🍇 Mystical Haroldian Paradise just Harold should have been ⚱ ➕ more lucky like Dominic le Sabre
always interesting to see how many cognates you can pick out from anglo-saxon and modern german that were replaced by latin terms in modern english
I wish there were more videos on youtube that talk about what could&#39;ve happened if the Norman conquest failed. The English language would&#39;ve been much nicer for a start.
☘️🦢💫 GOD MILTSEGE HIS SWALE🦢💫☘️
Can you reveal address about King 👑 Sigismund 🇻🇦 von Luxembourg 🇱🇺 🇰🇲 🇳🇵 🇾🇹 He is little covered like 🇭🇳 Harold in Old German 💫 🇭🇳 Hau 🦢 High Middle Ages German
This is the First 💫 🏮 ever song of Harold Godwinson 🇧🇾 ☯️ 🌊 I&#39;ve heard Thank you for aquescing to My Request from about a Week ago I&#39;ve requested song about Harold from Adrian von Zeigler but only found a poem a few years ago Katy Maberly as Edyth Swannesha may summon the Epic 1066 it&#39;s in imdb<br>Harold Godwines Sunu waes our Braveheart Avenger of Bulgaria 🇧🇬 Rex by merit like Timur the Great at Angora in 1402

Almost impossible to stop a Norman cavalry charge, prime of their age. I mean look what a bunch of normans did in the south of Italy! Specially Sicily, they really made the sarracens run back to their deserts in Africa.

Bloody fantastic. You even mentioned the six feet of earth quote.<br><br>This man was our Braveheart.
There goes a little thought of mine: as Harald Hardrada was the &quot;Burner of Bulgaria&quot;, then Harold Godwinson must have been the &quot;Avenger of Bulgaria&quot;. Reason enough for me to like the man. I hope I will be alive in 2066 for the thousandth jubilee of Stamford Bridge and Hastings, in order to honour good King Harold as a reenactor :)
We, Normans, now have to make an old Norman French song about Wilgelm FitzRobert King of England!
Yet another awesome song as always!<br>Just a question, but in just how many languages can you make songs?
Great song. Why are you calling Harald Hardrada Harold Hardrada tho? They are similiar but different names.
The noble work which u are doing is supported by our ancestors and gods keep it up and help us all learn about anglo saxons and their origin <br>May God bless you
Both the Anglo-Saxon and (possibly) Norman sides of me are sad, listening to this song.
amazing as per usual brother
What a banger how is this possible
Another great song.  💪🙏 about the dispute between William and Harald I like them both.  Both were brave, fearless and daring rulers.  In the end luck went to William.  I suppose I think that way because I&#39;m neither english nor french haha ​​😄
Absolutely love your work, you have a real talent for singing melodies and storytelling
As a German with passionate interest in linguistics, (naturally) especially west Germanic, you continue to delight me with every song. Thank you for your work, and I hope you feel as content as you deserve. 🙏
badass song mate
These songs got me trying to think of ways we can &quot;revive&quot; old english, love your songs
Best song in a while, maybe even the best so far, keep up the good work, bro. God bless.
Здравствуйте Уважаемый Друг! Если можно создать песни про Русских-Викингов-Христиан,таких,как Святой Владимир,Святой Ярослав друг Святого Олофа. Про Святого Дмитрия Донского. Он срожался с мусульманским завоеванием Руси. Спасибо!!
&quot;Where is Germany?&quot;<br><b>Points to Germany</b><br>&quot;Where is Brazil?&quot;<br><b>Points to Brazil</b><br>&quot;Where is Turkey?&quot;<br><b>Points to Turkey</b><br>&quot;Where is England?&quot;<br>&quot;It is gone.&quot;<br>&quot;Where is Harold Godwinson?&quot;<br><b>Points to heart</b>
Great as always, keep up the good work.
Could you please do a song about King Stephen? I think it might be interesting to hear a song about him during &quot;The Anarchy&quot; where he fought Empress Maude/Matilda. At the battle of Lincoln in 1141 he fought off the imperials until his sword broke, upon which one of his men handed him a battle axe; he kept fighting until he was struck by a stone and captured by the Empress`s soldiers.
As a Frenchman I would say it would be better than William fails in Hastings
Man, the old Anglo-Saxon language was truly very beautiful and unique like old norse.
What do you think of the theories that pre-Norman conquest England was Orthodox Christian?",PT7M41S

🎤 Lyrics: Imagine Dragons - Believer

[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flame
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Lyrics]
""Goodness of God""

I love You, Lord
Oh, Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
And all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
And in darkest night You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God, yeah
And all my life You have been faithful, oh
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God, yeah
'Cause Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now
I give You everything
'Cause Your goodness is running after, it's running after me, oh-oh
'Cause Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now
I give You everything
'Cause Your goodness is running after, it keeps running after me
And all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna sing
Oh, 'cause
'Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
We love You for that
One for all my days

John 1:1, 3-4; 14,18*; Mt.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAivK29NEcE&amp;t=16m13s"">16:13</a>-20.<br><br>THE ANGELS GIVE GLORY TO GOD IN HEAVEN! HERE WE HEAR AND SEE EARTH &quot;ANGELS&quot; DOING IT TOO! RIGHT HERE! JUST LIKE YOU!<br><br>WE LOVE YOU, LORD! YOU GAVE ALL FOR US. YOUR SUFFERING WAS IMMENSE! WE GIVE YOU ALL THE GLORY! YOU ARE OUR LIFE SAVIOR. YOU KEEP YOUR WORD IN THE BIBLE.  Subscribed<br><br>GOD&#39;S BLESSINGS TO ALL NATIONS AND PEOPLES <br>Gospel! The good news about Jesus Christ and salvation from judgment on our sins. Jesus dined with His disciples; Mark 14:22-25, the night before He went to the cross.  <br>Jesus and His disciples were eating a Passover meal together at the Last Supper. After partaking of bread and wine (His body and His blood) , the Bible  mentions the hymn Jesus sang with His disciples. “And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives” Mark 14:26. What were they singing on such an occasion? PRAISE! Psalms 113-118. <br><br>THE GOOD NEWS<br>&quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me..&quot;John 14.6 .<br><br>Blood coming from his body, NAKED, hanging on that cross like Roman torture weapon!  What a Lord God and Savior! He had to. HE is God the Son. Only His sinless blood could pay our sins price.The Savior was born to die for our sins so we could live through Him.<br><br>THE PAYMENT BY HIS BLOOD FOR ALL SINS EVER!<br>&quot;And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&quot; Hebrews 9:22<br>Romans 5:8 &quot; But God demonstrates his love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, now justified by his blood, we will be saved from wrath through him.&quot;<br>“For he (God) hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” 2 Corinthians 5:21.<br>Matthew 26: 28 &quot;For this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.&quot; ( life is in the blood. He had to pay with His life)<br><br>* * * God knew your musical praise ministry before the world was made! Ephesians 1:1-14. Prayer goes out for you and those here. A Crown in Heaven awaits all who share the Gospel of Jesus Christ that saves a soul. ( see&quot;JESUS SAVES&quot;) 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20; Philippians 4:1. The Apostle Paul said in Romans 1:16 &quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek&quot;. <br><br>This praise resounds throughout the earth: &quot;Jesus Christ is Lord and God. Only He saves&quot;. He testified: &#39;&#39;I and my Father are One&quot; John 10:30 (*see also 31-42).<br> 2 Samuel chapter 22:verse 50 &quot;Therefore I will praise you, O Lord, out of the countries, and I will praise your name.&quot;<br><br>JESUS SAVES<br>God the Son (Jesus Christ) has given us the gospel to share with the world. Mark 16:15: &quot;And He said unto them, Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.&quot;<br>How can we hear it? Scripture tells us.  Romans 10:17 &quot;Then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&quot; (We receive the &quot;word&quot; in many ways. The &quot;Word&quot; is Jesus Christ!); John 1:1-5. God the Holy Spirit teaches through the Word of God in the Bible.<br><br>The Birth of Jesus Christ<br>Isaiah 7: 14: &quot;Therefore the LORD shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and call His name Immanuel.&quot; Hebrew: עִמָּנוּאֵל, &quot;God with us&quot; in human flesh but without sin. The Savior of the world was born to die for our sins! He did so 33 years later. His terrible ordeal; body mutilated; blood poured out, finally died (John 19:30; Luke 23:46 ) and was placed in a tomb and rose from the dead the 3rd day ! &quot;HE IS RISEN&quot; Matthew 28: 6.<br><br>Isaiah 53:&quot; 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; - IT IS FOUNDED UPON GOD&#39;S LOVE FOR MAN AND WOMAN HE CREATED<br><br>John 3:16 &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot;<br>&quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&quot; Romans 3: 23<br>&quot; For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot; Romans 6:23<br><br>&quot;1 Corinthians 15: 3 &quot;For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:&quot;<br><br>BY GOD&#39;S GRACE ALONE THROUGH FAITH ALONE IN JESUS CHRIST ARE WE SAVED<br>Ephesians 2:8 &quot;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 not of works, lest any man should boast.&quot;<br><br>Jesus died and paid the penalty for our sins to rescue us from eternal death. He died on our behalf. We believe in Him, trusting His death and shedding of His blood as payment for ALL our sins and His burial and  resurrection from the dead the third day! John 20:24-31; 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 above.<br><br>WHOSOEVER BELIEVES SHALL TESTIFY TO THE TRUTH<br>Romans 10:<br>9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>13 For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”<br><br>TO DIE IS TO REJECT SALVATION IN JESUS CHRIST AND BE SEPARATE FROM GOD FOREVERMORE<br>Salvation and forgiveness of sins is the blessing of anyone who believes in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. We receive the baptism of God the Holy Spirit immediately which seals us in Christ and that is permanent!  Ephesians 1:13-14. Those who reject the free gift of salvation, see John 3:16 above, &quot;perish&quot;, which means their sins are judged by God the Son and they suffer eternal separation from God and the family of God forever called the &quot;second death&quot;. Revelation 21:8.

Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, &quot;Who do people say I am?&quot; They replied, &quot;Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.&quot; (Mark 8:27-28)<br><br>&quot;But what about you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who do you say I am?&quot; (Mattew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAivK29NEcE&amp;t=16m15s"">16:15</a>)<br><br>Simon Peter answered, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; (Mattew<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAivK29NEcE&amp;t=16m16s"">16:16</a>)<br><br>&quot;But what about you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who do you say I am?&quot; Peter answered, &quot;You are the Christ.&quot;  (Mark 8:29)<br><br>When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him, &quot;Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?&quot; (Mattew 11:2-3)<br><br>Jesus replied, &quot;Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosyare cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. (Mattew 11;4-5)<br><br>ll this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:  (Mattew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAivK29NEcE&amp;t=1m22s"">1:22</a>-23)
This song is beautiful !!!🎶🎶

Fight Song - Eve (ENGLISH Cover) Chainsaw Man ED 12 | ファイトソング,"Fight Song / Eve【English Cover】ファイトソング

I sang an English Cover of Fight Song, by Eve! It was used as Chainsaw Man Ending 12, but also a continuation to Eve's ""How to Eat Life"", telling a story about second chances, moving on, and walking away from a life lived with closed eyes.

Big shoutout to @EveExplained for helping me analyze this song and MV so that I could create a great lyrical adaptation! Watch her analysis of Fight Song- Eve Music Video here:

Lyrics

This game of life's a fight, I'm on the board and I can't rest until I make it alive

I wish that I could find a way to ease the pain that eats away at me every night

They take and take until they get their HEYDAY
Can't say a thing, unless you want a MAYDAY
And nothing will ever change,
My thoughts fade to a RA-TA-TA-TA-TA

But if all of the nonsense you've
Been promising's a lie to cheat me out of my dreams
I swear that I won't sleep until you've tasted the rage that I've caged and carried inside of me

Living life at your side, come lean on me when you like
In the dark of the night, I hear a call in my mind
And no matter what I try,
I'm haunted by the life I left behind 

While the night is still faint, let's dream of the future we'll make

The fight is on, let's dance
Tonight's our second chance
We're facing death still standing
We're the ones who write our ending
Feel the beat that's in my chest
Cuz the boy I've become is living, 
Moving on but not forgetting
It's our beginning

Come tonight, we'll touch the sky
Let's make a scene, it's alright
Be a rebel til the sunrise
Don't close your eyes, just lose your mind and watch the world shine
No time to think, just jump into the ring
The crowd is cheering on and on, our fight song

Came back from the brink of death
Never going down easy, we're swinging on as long as we live
No pain, no gain, that's the game and that's way we play, so take my hand and we'll take it away

Can't help the way I raise trouble each day
Living on the edge, but really what can I say
I'll still be a dead man someday
But the grave's gonna have to fight for me

I locked my heart away
So I could keep it safe from love and pain, but something has changed 
Looks like it's SHOWTIME, ey?
I've got nothing to lose, so I'll swing away with all of my rage

In the cage, I fight for meaningless praise
I'm at the top, so let me hear you say yay
I wanna be free, I pray
But in the end, it's all the same thing

Gloves are off, eyes are burning
So let's go, I'll give you a show

While the night is still faint, let's dream of the future we'll make
The fight is on, let's dance
Tonight's our second chance
We're facing death still standing
We're the ones who write our ending
Feel the beat that's in my chest
Cuz the boy I've become is living, 
Moving on but not forgetting
It's our beginning

Come tonight, we'll touch the sky
Let's make a scene, it's alright
Be a rebel til the sunrise
Don't close your eyes, just lose your mind and watch the world shine
No time to think, just jump into the ring
The crowd is cheering on and on, our fight song",544244,18249,756,2023-01-25T22:00:09Z,"Thank you so much for watching 💙<br>OUT NOW on Spotify- <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/TrickleYT"">https://tinyurl.com/TrickleYT</a><br>- Subscribe or I&#39;ll eat you ヽ(`⌒´メ)ノ
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn. Instant fan, instant follow.<br>All of the lyrics are so incredibly and astonishingly smooth and your voice fits the song so well. On my 10th loop and looking forward to listening to more from you!!!!!!
So gooodddddddddddddddd🤚🏻😭
Wait, i just found out fight song is the ending of chainsaw man (i watched it months ago)
Watching trickle cured my sickness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am now immortal.
What is that anime i want to see
Honestly, this is my prefered version from this song by far, it even exceeds the original for me.<br>I am still stunned by how good you covered this
🔥🔥
the subtitles placement is underrated, specially in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=1m12s"">1:12</a>
Este es mi cover favorito en inglés
damn- thats the first time ive ever actually really enjoyed an English cover of really any song- props to you man!
아 미치겠다 뭐라 말을 하고싶은데 표현할 단어가 떠오르질 않아요......... 진짜 사실 Eve님이신거 아니죠?????? 아니면 어떻게 이렇게 비슷하게 아니 와 아
凄い！声質似すぎ
All my life i have been thinking that there&#39;s not a single cover that is made good enough to be at the same level as the original<br><br>You did prove me wrong<br>And not with just this one<br>All your covers are amazing
Pls do kaikai kitan 🙏😊
Normaly i dont like covers of songs<br>But this one is a banger and is very fiting to the song
I&#39;mma cheer on and on for this Fight Song!
Ok geez
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=0m13s"">0:13</a>
The cover is amazing❤
Jesus omg i thought this was Japanese you were speaking you sound a lot like eve
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=2m48s"">2:48</a> bro that addon had me dying I love it
LMFAO THE <br>ME:<br>YOU IF YOU DONT SUBSCRIBE<br>seriously tho i wasnt focusing when i clicked on this and i was like wait is that english why does it sound so similar to the original and just wtfed the whole video thru.
&quot;I&#39;ll still be a dead man someday<br>But the grave&#39;s gonna have to fight for me&quot;<br>Damn. My favorite line.
SUBSCRIBE OR ILL BEAT YOU SENSELESS
Fantastic cover. Would love an official version/collab with Eve. Really good work!
Metal gear vibes on this line: <br>Tobi - &#39;&#39;The fight is on let&#39;s dance&#39;&#39;<br>Sam - &#39;&#39;Let&#39;s dance&#39;&#39;
It’s a great song, but did this guy just make up all new lyrics? The english translation of the original Japanese lyrics that appear in the original music video aren’t even close to what this guy is saying.
I put this cover into my youtube music album a month ago and now I realize you are not Eve
I will speak in my homeland<br><br>QUE PIKA VEI NAMORAL MANO MUITO LINDOOOOOOOOOO
Lol it’s still sounds like the original well kinda...
Honestly eve should make an actual anime, id watch all of it
THIS SONG IS W AND THIS DUDE GOT BARS!!!
Your voice like Eve&#39;s voice
Trickle my super awesome dude I just started listening to your covers and I&#39;m addicted! Your&#39;e so gifted!!! All of these covers are SO GOOD!!! Thanks for blessing us with your voice!
Что это за аниме?
I was literaly so confused about what i heard, cause I expected a Cover of fight song and it sounds so much like the original, that I scrolled  down from full screen to check if I&#39;m on the right tab on my Browser XD<br>How, like Shiro would say: &quot;Omega Good Job!&quot; :3
Top 10 covers that were better than the original... Number 1:
I&#39;m in love with this song  ❤️‍🔥🫠👍
Your voice is literally perfect
<b>THE RHYTHM.</b><br><b>THE VOICE.</b><br><br>You&#39;re the first I&#39;ve seen to sing the lyrics in English like how Japanese sounds (sounds are shorter and syllables are more compact and don&#39;t blend).<br>Can&#39;t wait to see you at the top one day.
This cover is so amazing! Good job, Trickle! Also, you may never read this but I have a suggestion for another cover, even though you&#39;re probably busy. Do you think you could do a song like Mirage or Melty Land Nightmare by Harumaki Gohan? Your voice would be fitting for songs like those. :)
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=2m47s"">2:47</a> I can&#39;t XD
LOL <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=2m48s"">2:48</a>
I still don&#39;t and can&#39;t understant how you sing so perfectly
Woooooooow no words left to say.. ur perfect.... Love ur voice....

Absolutely awesome! I&#39;m not a fan, but I love this Double Knot by Stray kids, the back ground music is SICK!! SO DOPE!! <br>I love this and Easy, that&#39;s dope too! I also like Surfing, another dope song!! <br><br>Wow, Stray Kids, are definitely understated when they do dope rap tunes like East and Double Knot. Definitely should collaborate with either a British or American rapper. Those back ground tunes and dance choreography is sick!!

Death Note: The Musical - Where Is the Justice? (ENGLISH),"The Complete 2015 English Concept Album
The NY Cast

I own nothing!",4694506,56236,3085,2017-12-05T23:47:04Z,"&quot;We all need some justice.&quot; I felt that one.
So excited I&#39;ve got tickets to see this in the UK!
Jermy&#39;s voice is always so full of emotion... it&#39;s so beautiful. this rule and Varien rule, he&#39;s doing everthing so wonderful with all his heart.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6DuWvmyqzY&amp;t=1m32s"">1:32</a> I love this line
THIS SONG IS SUCH A BANGER WHY AM I FIVE YEARS LAYE TO THIS
Going to see in London in August, so excited!
This is so funny bc like. Everyone he kills already has been arrested unless they’re trying to stop him doing murder
is that.... is that jeremy jordan?
We’re finally getting an English version of the musical lets fucking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I want to see these song live so badly 😻 you guys should like come to texas but idk just a suggestion
is it just me or does light remind anyone of JD?
It&#39;s just now occurring to me how unimaginably based Light is
Play this while when they burn cop city
So the Musical is now happening in London. What&#39;ve been able to find out is that the composer who is making the songs is the same one who made this concept album.<br><br>There is a high chance that we will have most if not all the same songs in this album
8 years I&#39;ve been waiting to see this live in theatres, now my childhood dream is a reality &lt;3
The UK Production better do well so we can get an official US release
I’m so glad this is happening again my siblings and I listened to this religiously back in the day
I have discovered the existence of the Death Note musical, and I can&#39;t stop listening to it.
Best line: Perhaps it&#39;s time we drain the color from within<br>Till we&#39;re back to seeing black and white<br>And wrong and right again<br><br>You see that Light firmly believes in this world view out of choice and not just naivety. His actions are still wrong, but there is something compelling to not overexcusing criminals.
Love the song, but they definitely deviated from Light&#39;s personality.
“The worlds not black or white the choice not either or”<br>“Perhaps it’s time to drain the color from it then till we’re back to seeing black and white and wrong and right again”<br>Okay this line is brilliant. Light in this song is singing how he wants to bring justice to the world and in this line he proposes a method however metaphorical- drain the color. Make the world black and white. An authoritarian police state where you must perform to a certain standard of “goodness” to live. This is BRILLIANT writing.
I can see myself un-ironically belting this song in a corrupt courtroom
THIS IS JEREMY JORDAN WTF
&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s time we drain the color from it then, till we&#39;re back to seeing black and white and right and wrong again&quot; is such a good fucking line. Really goes to show his supremacist views and his clash with L&#39;s POV
Okay, but why does this give me The Dear Hunter vibes? 🤔
You know the world’s fucked up when you start agreeing with Light Yagami of all people…
CAN&#39;T WAIT FOR THIS TO COME TO LONDON &lt;3
DEATH NOTE COMING TO WEST END LETS GOOO
If light sang all his evil plans I&#39;d be on his side
I am living for all the analysis in the comments
ate it up fr
I wonder if Jeremy Jordan remembers recording this and/or remembers the lyrics
let the rich and famous, GET AWAY WITH MURDERR!!!!!
Really underrated musical. My second favorite stage musical of all time.
My fave musical theatre song
Just putting this out there i just realized light is varian from tangled the series 😱
This just popped up in a YouTube mix. Never heard it before. I was aware this musical existed but never listened to it- what the hell am I missing out on?????
THE CASTING IS SO PERFECT ⁉️⁉️⁉️
here is my take on death note as an adult. As a teenager when i first watched death note my mind was imatture and i always thought light was correct. but upon a rewatch as an adult i realized somthing like this when it comes to petty crimes like theft and vandilism this sort of thing would be awful. and suprisingly it was a dub line from a random extra that changed my <a href=""http://mind.in/"">mind.in</a> the scene he is vey cleary  talking to a love one telling them in a nervous tone &quot; just dont do anything bad&quot;. could you imagine living in a world like that. Now on the other hand when it comes to Major crimes like Murder R and Assualt. An eye for eye. like the song says its a complicated system and theres no right answer to what true justice is.
This song had no reason being so good… istg I sing it from my SOUL
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6DuWvmyqzY&amp;t=2m50s"">2:50</a> I&#39;m tagging this for myself because it&#39;s the best part
This is great but i can’t get over the fact that its Jeremy Jordan
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6DuWvmyqzY&amp;t=1m58s"">1:58</a> &quot;But The Rich and Famous Get Away With Murder&quot; MISA?! She&#39;s the one actually got away with it, in the end, she&#39;s the one who survived!
But seriously guys. He never actually cared about the victims or the “the justice” That was just his Superman excuse…
This is what I am saying
He&#39;s so much more based than in the anime 😩
I wish they did an ACTUAL musical! I would wear that out quicker than ppl wore out Hamilton
Never seen the anime but I am in love with this soundtrack. Deadass might be my favorite musical track ever and it never even made it out of the concept phase :(
I can imagine Mikami singing this🖋📓

Ramadan - Lyrics:

You lift me up high
You spread my wings 
And fly me to the sky
I feel so alive
It's like my soul thrives in your light
But how I wish you'd be
Here with me all year around

Chorus: 
Ramadan Ramadan,
Ramadanu ya habib
(Ramadan, Ramadan, 
Ramadan O beloved)
Ramadan Ramadan 
Laytaka dawman qareeb
(Ramadan, Ramadan, 
How I wish you were always near)

Love is everywhere
So much peace fills up the air
Ramadan month of the Quran
I feel it inside of me, strengthening my Iman
But how I wish you'd be
Here with me all year around

Chorus

I just love the way you make me feel
Every time you come around you breathe life into my soul
And I promise that
I'll try throughout the year
To keep your spirit alive
In my heart it never dies
Oh Ramadan!

LYRICS:
IN CHRIST ALONE MY HOPE IS FOUND
HE IS MY LIGHT MY STRENGTH MY SONG
THIS CORNERSTONE THIS SOLID GROUND
FIRM THROUGH THE FIERCEST DROUGHT AND STORM
WHAT HEIGHTS OF LOVE WHAT DEPTHS OF PEACE
WHEN FEARS ARE STILLED WHEN STRIVINGS CEASE
MY COMFORTER MY ALL IN ALL
HERE IN THE LOVE OF CHRIST I STAND


בן אלוהים לבש בשר
THE SON OF GOD CAME IN FLESH
מלוא אלוהות בגוף אדם
FULL DIVINITY IN HUMAN BODY
מתנת צדקה ואהבה
A GIFT OF JUSTICE AND LOVE
חייו הוא נתן ככפרה
HE GAVE HIS LIFE AS A RANSOM


ذاقَ العنا عَنّا قَضى
HE SUFFERED AND DIED FOR US
فيهِ اكتَفى حُكمُ الإِله
IN HIM GOD'S JUDGMENT WAS FULFILLED
شالَ الخَطا عَنّي غَدا
HE TOOK MY SIN
في مَوتِهِ لِيَ حَياة
IN HIS DEATH I HAVE LIFE
في ظُلمَةِ القَبرِ ثَوى
HE STAYED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE GRAVE
مَع أَنَّهُ نورُ الحَياة
THOUGH HE IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE
وَقامَ هازِمًا قِوى
AND HE ROSE AND DEFEATED
المَوتِ الرَّهيبِ بِقِواه
THE TERRIBLE DEATH WITH HIS STRENGTH


בניצחון עומד עתה
NOW HE STANDS IN VICTORY
קללת החטא נוצחה הוסרה
THE CURSE OF SIN WAS DEFEATED AND REMOVED
אני שלו והוא שלי
I'M HIS AND HE IS MINE
נקניתי בדם פודי ישעי
I WAS BOUGHT WITH THE BLOOD OF MY SAVIOR


NO GUILT IN LIFE NO FEAR IN DEATH
THIS IS THE POWER OF CHRIST IN ME


ריבון עולם
WORLD SOVEREIGN
אשא עיני
I LIFT MY EYES
כי בידיך עיתותיי
BECAUSE MY TIMES ARE IN YOUR HANDS


نيرُ الخَطا وَلَعنَتُه
THE YOKE AND CURSE OF SIN
زالا بِفَضلِ غَلبَتِه
WERE REMOVED DUE TO HIS VICTORY


TILL HE RETURNS OR CALLS ME HOME

So so beautiful, our Lord and Savior be praised in all nations and in all languages of the world! United in Christ
We are soo lucky we know Jesus and His saving power.
I will never forget attending Nabeel Qereshi&#39;s funeral in 2017 in Houston, Texas. We, hundreds of believers in a Christian church, sang this song among his Muslim family members, but knew his Christian wife was singing, too. Nabeel was a devout Muslim who wrestled with his faith as he roomed in college with a devout Christian, eventually studying both texts (Quran and Bible) and coming to the conclusion that the Bible is the truth. He spent the rest of his life, tragically cut short by cancer, writing and speaking about Christian apologetics and ministry.<br>The line that always gets me is &quot;No power of hell, no scheme of man can ever pluck me from His hand.&quot; You sing that lyric differently when you&#39;re standing in a large worship center, having gone through bag checks to enter and seeing police guarding the casket due to online threats of violence prior to the service because of the life he led, truth he believed and shared, and conversion he had. What a wonderful testimony!
Both Israel and Palestine needs to stop fighting and share the land. The holy land belongs to everyone, all the jews, christians and muslims. We all can share the land and not fight about it. And pray together ✝️✡️☪️ 🇮🇱🤝🇵🇸 <br>We are all created by God🙏
That’s beautiful… Praise the LORD JESUS who’s died for us
This is such an awesome version! God bless all of you!
It would be more meaningful if we could stop the genocide of Palestinians...
I know English but…. To know which one is Hebrew and which one is Arabic🤔 I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♀️ me encanta!😊 Si le agregan más idiomas sería wow 🤩 ❤
Glory to JESUS (YESHUA) the Messiah! Our Glory, Lord, Savior, the Son of God! The Eternal Life!!!<br><br>Jesus is Holy Love of YHVH!
Praise the Lord ❤️🙌🏼
In Christ Alone Beautiful song, brought Tears to my eyes. ❤
so so wonderful oh my Lord when will we be with you face to face x
I m too from Muslim background excepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and saviour he’s the love of my whole being.The best choice I ever made in my life

Lyrics:
I stood atop the board, all while the pain is piercing deep, just like a stinging, old thorn
Frustration’s one true form should be the state of mind I wanna see as a dream I adore
Spinning ‘round for always, yet another heyday
If that’s what I’d say, it would be a mayday
Although I may grow and age, still my head aches, going rattattatta

Now, if only your nonsense seemed like they’re words that rob the views, so false in all their beliefs
Revenge has truly seethed within its one true form in the lungs and with the lead I feel deep
Living on with this one life and I’m holding on tight
I’m drunk and high on impulse and drive
Although I may feel disguised, if there’s a place where I belong and can fight

Let us show all our dreams in dark nights, refusing to die

Let’s run and make a break for the future that we take
To death, for which we all pray
And surrender to a great rage
Go be calm and one with time
There’s a boy with a promise inside
For today, just like a past life
With no future in sight

Come and let your voice shout loud
Let’s take it easy right now
No common sense to be found
We only know the world through eyes, so wise, without a doubt
They overflow, these feelings I behold
And just like a show, applaud me when I go

The true form a comeback takes with the words with which we’re raised from the depths of our pain
The ache, the blaze like a flame, there isn’t any place I can escape, and even the same
Even now, we make ourselves fools that all play
It feels so great to pave a simple dream’s ways
Although I may drop dead one day, it’s okay, it’s like a boring joke I’d say 

The form of love is like a little hell in which you’re lost without hurting inside
The better showtime thrives when there is nothing left to lose deep within your own mind
Bowing down to pride, so stupid and blind
The best I find, cling upon it and rise
Just as it was that time, I wanted just a normal, plain life

With those eyes that are rusted in this light, let’s see where you lie

Let us show all our dreams in dark nights, refusing to die

Let’s run and make a break for the future that we take
To death, for which we all pray
And surrender to a great rage
Go be calm and one with time
There’s a boy with a promise inside
For today, just like a past life
With no future in sight

Come and let your voice shout loud
Let’s take it easy right now
No common sense to be found
We only know the world through eyes, so wise, without a doubt
They overflow, these feelings I behold
And just like a show, applaud me when I go",888295,22440,460,2023-01-29T17:00:06Z,"STREAM THIS ON SPOTIFY HERE!!! <a href=""https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/chainsaw-heart"">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/chainsaw-heart</a><br>long awaited and heavily anticipated, i finally sang another Eve song!! maybe more to come, im starting to like him a lot... enjoy &amp; if eve sees this ily

What anime is this song from? (I watched chainsaw man and didnt see this once so i think its a diffrent anime).
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fci12q4hC7w&amp;t=0m16s"">0:16</a> I Heard &quot;penis&quot; instead of &quot;pain piercing&quot;
This is d*mb impressive, its so hard to make a english traslation sound good, english isnt a rhythmic language its not even a spoken language its made to be efficiently  read with implied context hence red, red, read, read, all &quot;can&quot; sound the same but have different context
Ok so sorry if I’m dumb or just not understanding but what is this from? And where and I read or watch it? This look so amazing and I love the song, if anyone can tell me I’d appreciate it so much, thank you!
wowwwwwwww.. i never liked english covers yooo.. you make me discover that it can be possible
я влюбилась в ваш голос
I cannot stress how good this cover is
The sentient duffel bag is a neat concept
Just listed to this for the last concert of my school year
I remember how i wasn&#39;t interested in all the chainsaw man covers till my sibling showed me In the Back Room, then i watched Cerebral rendezvouz, and then this one. I literally, ALMOST CRIED.
Who else noticed that some of the lyrics were wrong😥
これ翻訳すると何て言ってるんだろ。気になりすぎて寝れん
what show is this????!!!
The guy really feels the music, whatever I turn on his voice is suited for anything….
Eve never misses
This song make&#39;s me want to be strong 😤😤😤
This is a banger. The music video reminds me of kill la kill.
What anime or manga is this?
Omg I have been looking for an English cover of this then I found this video!!! Thank you very much
ngl the animation should be made into a anime show or movie
This guy really went &quot;Where the f*ck is my child?&quot; <b>murderous eyes</b>
This is not only the most accurate English translation of this song... It&#39;s also the Best!! I don&#39;t usually add song covers to my Spotify lists, especially English covers, but this..!! this is different.!
Is it anime or just animation?
I applaud you as you go.
Müq
this isnt chainsaw man? is it?!
oh my gosh, my first time seeing eve song rhyme in english
Anime what is it called?
The only fight here is me against the urge to get ripped
did this man seriously skipped chainsaw man ed 3. no dignity.<br><br>jokes aside this is really awesome like always. but i still wanted to see the 3rd ending
is this an anime?? or us it just animated for this video?
получилось прикольно, жаль только качество съел и мелодию испортил :(
Pain is piercing sounds like penis pissing and no I’m not sorry
Can you do a cover for how to eat life
Uh uh your voice is lower but not as high as <b>****</b>
I&#39;m happy to hear my favorite song in English！！( *⁠´⁠꒳`  )
Name of the series used in the video
yeah
And then there&#39;s me who didn&#39;t know this song was in chainsaw man
As someone who loves eve. AHHHHHHHHHH /pos
超かっこいい〜っ！！<br>NICE English cover!!👏✨
Goosebumps, DAMN! I love this
^^
Your telling me this isn&#39;t it&#39;s own anime
sorry im late i was drooling looking at tobi
NOW DO HOW TO EAT LIFE IT&#39;S A PREQUAL
They should seriously make an anime out of this

Anime [amv]- Toca Toca | Official Music Video (full version),"Anime [amv] - Toca Toca | Official Music Video (full version)

Hi, friends! I'm Kurbeli! I create funny videos with different sound variations. My channel differs from similar ones in that I create videos with a special approach: first, i using the Adobe After Effects, I cut out characters for further editing, and then add unique sound and video effects. Also, I use free images from google on the background in my locations in the video.

All my video features materials protected by the Fair Use guidelines of Section 107 of Copyright Act. It takes about 4 hours to create these videos so that my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video I created.

The audio and video sources in this video were created in such a way that the viewer hears and sees the new UNIQUE content.

Thank you for watching!

#oshinoko  #Reaction #DrumRollTonyReacts",303999,11592,482,2023-05-30T16:00:07Z,"👀 Oshi no Ko Full Episode Reactions are on Patreon!  <br><a href=""https://www.patreon.com/drumrolltonyreacts"">https://www.patreon.com/drumrolltonyreacts</a>
I see you DrumRollTony holding back those manly tears especially during the ending when Ai tells Aqua and Ruby she loves them.
its the persepctive of ai hoshino aqua nd rubis mother, &quot;its ur realest ai&quot; gives it away if not anything else but a little  funny fact ai also means love in japanese so she says &quot;its ur realest love&quot;
another cool thing i noticed. around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Yscz6k9uY&amp;t=4m28s"">4:28</a>, the part where she says &quot;I&#39;m Maria&quot;, the song is referring to Ai and comparing her to Mary. Mary, mother of Jesus, had him while being a virgin kind of like Ai who had children while still being a virgin in the eyes of her fans
Thats wild how good it is even in english and the lyrics adding so much more weight knowing what they mean.
I think the part with the lies and stuff means that That she really wants to love ruby and aqua and not a lie to them. And say I love you from the heart so like the last line when she said finally I can say I love you and jm nkt lyingI
I think what makes this more impactful is when she genuinely says &quot;I love you&quot; as she jumps on Aqua and Ruby knowing how much her children meant to her.
The ending of the song always gets me to tear up... &quot;I finally said it [...] I love u&quot; and than she disapeares... Just like in the first episode. Crying every time
You talk too much I hate Reaction YouTuber who talk too much your videos are soo boring 🙄
Both are awesome i can understand English Better and i enjoy Japanese more but still i Prefer Japanese og is the best in English i know true meaning of this song and it&#39;s sad but in Japanese it cheers you up to keep going
Pls listen Turkish version.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Yscz6k9uY&amp;t=1m19s"">1:19</a> you know why he couldn&#39;t read the Lyrics First Tile 😏
those few last sentences always remind me of her last worlds &quot;i love you&quot; and &quot;those words definitely weren&#39;t a lie&quot; and i need to hold back tears
listening to songs that yoasobi translated, just makes me question if it&#39;s english or japanese
It’s the hate comments that she would get from her talents
Damn  These are the best lyrics i have ever heard.
She did not lie about her last words...  Because it is her last words.
yoasobi did such good job of translating the lyrics over while keeping them on beat... hearing this side by side with the original is crazy
Yoasobi&#39;s ability to make depression songs so catchy is a curse...
I&#39;m just gonna say:<br>The basic meaning of this song is the fakeness of being a famous idol. The pressure, the narcissists and being used are all in this song.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Yscz6k9uY&amp;t=2m46s"">2:46</a> : This part tells how &quot;exaggerated&quot; this girl is popular<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Yscz6k9uY&amp;t=3m06s"">3:06</a> Is talking about how everything isn&#39;t perfect, she can&#39;t forgive herself for that from all the pressure<br><br>I just found this out by listening the the OG idol アイドル and took thoughts into it<br>But I&#39;m not 100 percent on this with my small ass head
The “we” makes me think it’s the P.O.V of her fans
Well ai have two sides  and one of them is dark  and aqua takes after her dark side while Ruby takes her bright side so maybe it&#39;s her dark part
It won&#39;t be sad....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>So long as you add <b>GETTER CHAAAANGE!!!</b>
the ending is much better
The song is a reference to the story of Ai&#39;s Password 45510. You have to take a look at it. It&#39;s an interesting read.
I love that Ai means love in japanese but also could mean A.I. (artificial intelligence) and the symbolism that A.I. is real knowledge gathered from humanity but ultimately could never understand humanity.
i think is the pov of the one that kill Ai
the song really summarize the ep 1 of the anime, first time hearing the song you will think how energic and abit brightful it is but until you watch the first episode of the anime you will realize how depressing and sad it is
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Yscz6k9uY&amp;t=2m59s"">2:59</a> POV of the members of B komachi they were jealous of Ai getting all the fame and being the star
In japanese, Ai means love, this give the lyrics some word puzzles to solve.
I think yoasobi is the only singer that the song is joyful but the meaning is pretty dark like &quot;oshi no ko op&quot;and&quot;racing to the night&quot;
MANGA SPOILER:<br>The part you were asking about whose POV it was, is probably the &quot;crow&quot; girl which we don&#39;t know too much about but is definitely related to the reason why gojo(aqua) and serina(ruby) were reincarnated
I think that the second POV is from either B-komachi or Miyuko (is that her name?)
Impressive job. Lots of talent here!
Veo este canal aunque no entienda nada de lo que diga 😅
I have no context of oshi no ko, but in the song they keep on using the phrase &quot;kampeki na ai&quot;<br>I know that Ai is the name of someone. I also know that Ai also means love. However, they do not use the kanji for it (愛) and rather kept it in its katakana form.<br>The last time I saw this happen was in The Blessed Messiah and the Tower of Ai. Which makes it sad because &quot;ai&quot; for love and &quot;ai&quot; for sorrow are pronounced exactly the same but are differentiated by the kanji 愛vs哀<br>That way, the phrase &quot;kanpeki na ai&quot; can both mean &quot;the perfect love&quot; or &quot;the perfect misery/sorrow&quot;
Thanks for covering both the original version and the english version , amazing video .<br>I&#39;m personally in a tough situation and thought you could shine some light.<br>Without a doubt this is going to be a long comment but it would really help if you could bear with me.<br><br>I&#39;m working for a japanese musician as a japanese to english translator and she asked me whether to put subtitles or to create an english version of the song.<br>Needless to say these two options are so different.<br>Subtitles can express even to the slightest of details that are scattered all over the lyrics , however, the viewer would have to stop every few seconds to read them. I&#39;m afraid that this divides the lyrics from the melody , which should be in harmony to keep the song alive. Also , I&#39;m a bit skeptical if non-japanese people would repeatedly listen to a song that they wouldn&#39;t understand directly. Sure they would know the general meaning but isn&#39;t it hard to remember what the subtitle said and listen to the song at the same time?<br>On the other hand , creating an english version would free the viewers from reading and comprehending subs while listening to the song. Viewers would be able to lean back and listen to her music just like ones in their native language. However , it&#39;s extremely hard to recreate the original song. Rhythms and meanings are always in a trade-off position. Keep the rhythm and the meaning becomes untruthful , keep the meaning and there will be unnecessary words and words paired with notes in a weird way. I don&#39;t mean to talk bad about the translator of the song &quot;Idol&quot; , but you may have noticed some unnecessary words placed in the english version. (e.g. &quot;yes indeed&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Yscz6k9uY&amp;t=2m14s"">2:14</a> ) This is probably because the translator had to adjust the rhythm. These unavoidable things might bug people that are listening .<br><br>With the benefits and drawbacks considered , which do you thing would be the better option subbing or creating an english version ?<br><br>Oh if you need other examples of translated songs , YOASOBI  has a few of them.<br><br>Any advise would really help me out.<br>Thanks for reading all this , thanks for your time and I hope you have a great day.
I love how song really summarizes the anime
Not sure if you got an answer to your question that makes sense to you, but imo the POV in that breakdown is from the internet/social media. <br><br>BTW, thanks so much! Your excellent reaction here inspired me to watch the Anime series and I am now all caught up waiting for Episode 9 to drop today.
The perfect unmatched idol&#39;s name is Ai, which means Love in japanese.<br>Everytime she sings about the perfect Ai (idol) she is trying to portray her (Ai) search for the perfecto Ai (love).<br>Which is a huge misconceptiong Ai has for the meaning of Love, since she has never experienced it before (there is no perfect love, nor anything, in this imperfect, beautiful world).
Everyone knows why he stopped at &quot;unveiled secrets&quot;.............
The middle section is the POV of other Idols (like B-Komachi bandmates and other actresses that shared screen time with Ai), they&#39;re jealous of her talent and dislike being just as a &quot;support for her grace&quot;.
This is why Japanese media is the best. Even their English version is way better than any western song
im pretty sure that the pov that you asked abt ,like whith the rap,its the stalker that killed her
this song is about the idol entertainment in japan, which is sometimes really dark, she say it a lot of times but it&#39;s all about lie, saying &quot;idk&quot; or something like that not to hurt fans. <br>  You can also see 2 sides of Ai (Ai is the name of the girl, but also mean &quot;love&quot; in jp), 1 bright, which is the one she&#39;s showing, and 1 darker which is the one she&#39;s not showing, and more she lies, more and more these 2 sides becomes far from the other one, for example, you can see at the beginning, the 2 parts of Ai touching a nice red heart, and at the end of the music, it&#39;s the exact same heart, but a dark red broken heart, almost gray, and this time, the 2 Ai are looking at the heart dispersedly.<br>  For me the saddest part of this song is the ending, when she say she&#39;s sure it&#39;s not a lie and the &quot;i love you&quot; (ai shiteiru in japanese) and then disappears, cause she&#39;s sure it&#39;s not a lie only when she&#39;s dead cause she lied all her life.<br>I have sooooo much to say about this song, but one thing, this group, yoasobi, are sooo good to do a happy song with super sad story.
men if your&#39;e gonna play the music stop pausing it
1st verse - fans’ pov<br>2nd verse - Ai’s coworkers’ pov<br>3rd verse - Ai’s pov
did you see the anime? lol
Believe it or not you finally made me start this one… I really regret not having started it before. Thank you!<br><br>For the ones who doubt: it isn’t an idol show.
There is 3 povs the fans the haters and AI the part u are confused is the pov of the haters",PT6M47S
"Sun Maahi (English Version) - Armaan Malik, Amaal Mallik | Always Music Global","#SunMaahi is a very special song for me and my imprint Always Music Global. The outpour of love on the track has been so overwhelming and owing to this response from all my fans and listeners, we have put together an EP titled ‘Sun Maahi - The EP’ which features a brand-new English version of the track and a LoFi mix alongside the original Hindi track and an instrumental. I truly believe this song has a lot of unexplored colours and possibilities and I wanted to bring it to life with these two new versions. Hope that you all enjoy it and that these new tracks make you fall in love with the song even more.

SHAKIRA || BZRP Music Sessions #53 (English Lyrics),"Notes:

*Chew it and swallow, swallow and chew it: I wasn't really sure of how to translate this expression, but it basically means to ""suck it up"".

*Sorry if it splashes you: That's the correct translation, this note is more like a fun fact, in spanish, this reads as ""Perdón que te salpique"", but she says it with a little pause: ""sal-PIQUE"", discretly mentioning her ex's name

*Clearly: This is the literal translation, however, this is a hint to someone's name too. In spanish, the word is ""claramente"", but she, again, uses a subtle pause: ""CLARA-mente"", Clara Chia is presumed to be Gerald Piqué's mistress.

*I'm letting you go tomorrow: This was a tricky one to translate... In spanish, she says ""Te desocupo mañana"", which can mean she is setting him free, but I'm not sure if that's the correct expresion since she is not rlly restraining him from anything, it's more like ""I'm gonna leave you alone so she can take my place"".

It’s true. Shakira and Miley Cyrus they both have moon in scorpio in their natal charts. Women like them can’t stand weak shallow coward immature men. They’re all about serious commitment. They wAnt all or nothing. They’re deep, passionate, emotionally intense, extremely loyal and giving, and they expect/demand the same from them. It’s not easy to be with them. The relationship is filled with drama snd fire. Not every man can handle such intense relationship. They are really too much for most people. You have to be a superman to be with them. Pique tried to bite and chew more than he could swallow and digest. Lol I’m sure he just got tired of her intensity. He really is better off with someone like Clara.
Wtf
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Damn!! I&#39;d wouldn&#39;t want to be him right now😥. Great beat, lyrics are very classy and vicious at the same time!! There has to be a man in her &quot;network&quot; that would be good for her!!

No me convence la traducción,  hay interpretaciones traducidas al inglés qué no pega como en español.
Pa tipos como tu!!
I love Shakira since I was a teenager and almost all of her songs IDK I’m not a fan of this one , because I believe the whole song is telling the guy I don’t even give a damn about you. But by not saying anything about him, she would show more how much she actually doesn’t care about him! And whatever he did or is still is a father of her children! Plus a person who left a girl for Shakira would have left her for someone else too! I mean you can guess his personality if it’s all true what people say! ❤
Shakira i love you! ❤️
Man ths sick ass beat 😊
😂😂😂Now we finally know what the song was really all about. 😂😂😂 Shakira he is a weirdo for sure! You can do better, and I&#39;m sorry he wasted your time. He should have stayed in his arena🌈 a long time ago. He probably only used you for your money.

this woman is emazing,very clever move this song.she can take a divorce and make it musik and good musik,best song by far,she gets new in every time,she is a real star...
This song will be every woman’s battle cry song every time they are jilted… way to go Shakira, indeed a she wolf like you is incomparable to anyone, stay strong!
When Piket will sing a song to tell the truth my vote will go to Shakira.Because she can play football,he can sing?
So try to love not to cheat.
Love is complicated.Women or man is not right to trade Love with another person.
true, when a women are in love with a man,that man have no chance.

No pretending I listened to the whole ‘new song’ about Equivalent ‘replacement’. Could not; would not. <br>This comment regards my std. When u refer to ‘men’ calling them ‘guys’ u get the faireturn. When u market and promote sexual female objectification, do not cry complain for not being the one conveniently safe exception to a rule which yr guy 1st fan would too observe. <br>Lastly, my kid, do not listen to __opinions! If they did not ace calculus they r Morones.
Marvellous!
Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The womens of tiday make invoices
thank you so much for translating! especially for adding all the little nuances hidden in the lyrics! something all of us non spanish speakers will really appreciate!
Splashes = salpique  &lt; pique = her ex <br><br>Clearly = claramente &lt; clara  = his new bitch <br><br>It makes more sense in Spanish those two words has their names on it 😂 <br>shakira hit it!!!!! 👏🏼
Dudes instead of guys
I was too much for u so be with someone like you purrrr
Heard the CHA CHING 💰 loud and clear! You go girl!!
Don&#39;t shit on a Colombian hermana,in your face Pique ✊
In English it’s too nice! She could have been vicious if she really wanted to! Prayers for a great new life without your cheating ex! ❤️🙏
I mean cool… but a lot of these lyrics have incorrect pronouns and just don’t sound right. For example, sure she is TECHNICALLY saying “I am too big or much for you…” but what it really should be in English is “I’m out of your league”. Just stuff like that. It’s a cool video, but anyone can use google translate.
The little Spanish I do know... &quot;Tiene nombre de persona buena&quot; means &quot;I have the name of a good person.&quot;
Nice
Way too clever.. Love it!!
nice
OMG!!! I fn love this!!! I don’t even speak Spanish.. or did understand the song until now… man! Who cheats on Shakira? She’s a savage! I fn love her!!! ❤❤
She was gone from the limelight to support him and tend to their children, but the She Wolf has come back with a vengeance hit.
She&#39;s acting like a maniac. I don&#39;t know this Shak, but apparently Gerard did and left. He loved her and you saw him often with his children.  He didn&#39;t leave her in debt, she is being investigated for tax fraud, not Gerard...because she was going in and out of country so often it couldn&#39;t be calculated for her time in Spain..AND those were the years she had tiny babies. I know mothers work,  but leaving them behind so much you lose track? I know she loves her boys but now she has them in pictures, the 3 of them looking so sad. Listen to the songs she written about their daddy. He says they broke up when she kept leaving country in 2021 and when was in country,  she took up skateboarding and surfing...without family.  Ok, a woman can have hobbies...but she travels alone so much all over the world.  Was always on tiktok, like a child...she needed time for herself? No family first. He left  and when he did, he found someone,  but Shak is a superstar and dies not want to be second best. The girlfriend? Well, I don&#39;t have respect for her either, but as a mother who has been in Shak&#39;s shoes (without the private jet) you suck it up and don&#39;t bad mouth daddy. Her own father was in hospital and she took world wide trip with boys. I know...I was a shak fan to the max. I thought Antonio before Gerard was awful...now I&#39;m wondering.  Shak is good at watching her image. THATS what pissed her off. Sorry shak...you&#39;re 46...got up and keep your kids out of it. Ih...and Gerard has not hid in shame. He goes to the kids games...Shak was photographed giving him the finger...he still goes out. He&#39;s taking it like a man. Or maybe too he has nothing to hide. I don&#39;t care for her new music anyway. Maybe she&#39;s worried about getting old. Goodbye Shakira

#EnsembleStarsMusic #Enstars1stAnniversary #BrandNewStars

Lyrics:
When harmonizing your dreams, they always bring melodies
Let’s head onto the stage just as we are!

Ensemble Stars!! GO!!

When our hearts have a bond in place, then a song comes and resonates
With all the phrases of fate
Let us ride rhythm’s every part, it’ll change when the beat embarks
And let’s reach for all the stars

Now jump into the sky, where everything has a start
Every single time 
Color as you like
Ensemble Stars!!

There’s no end to what’s waiting for you
Run along and move, let your doubt defuse
Hear our beating hearts of youth

This is the place where we come to rise and shine like the sun
Your color runs, your one and only one
(Shine on the stage)
And when the light still finds another, glowing bright
They rush and fly into a brilliant shine
(The latest flash to come my way)

When harmonizing your dreams, they always bring melodies
So let them free! Ring loud, my brand new beat
(So wonder beat)
Now let’s embark to find this future that is ours
Let’s head onto the stage just as we are!

The sounding ensemble, the lights that shine our way
Go on and paint them with colors, never known to our gaze
Our shining ensemble will reach your heart someday
With the phrases of fate",57154,6500,436,2023-06-17T16:00:09Z,"i was given the wonderful opportunity of collaborating with Ensemble Stars!!

✻ Lyrics ✻ (Feel free to use!)

I’m suddenly taken back to that time
When I waited for you underneath that blue sky
Passing by me in an instant
Slipping from the depths of my imagination
Hey, can somebody tell me what’ll happen next?
Say, tell me how to make it go on just another day
Looking right into your eyes
As I walk away_ from you one last time

I’m suddenly taken back to that time
All the summers that would bore me out of my mind
Didn’t I quit playing piano?
Out of habit tapping on my desk to play the notes
Hey, can somebody tell me what I’m gonna do?
“Hey, anything besides music should be okay”
Everything will be okay

If you took my heart and drew
A single note just straight on through
No it wouldn’t disappear believe me
Whatever I do it just won’t disappear
It’s still right here

But I’ve got it wrong again
I don’t understand
I don’t really care though
Not about music or truth or the world or this life I hold
I don’t really care, no!
Seeing things in black or white, isn’t right, it’s just an excuse right?
One thing’s for sure though
Everything is your fault

I’m suddenly taken back to that time
Growing old was the only thing on my mind
Knowing that someday I would die was like a stab in the chest, though I never understood why 
“Hey do you know what you’ll be doing one day?”
Passing by the years I knew what I would do one day
I’d be doing nothing at all

All your positivity, ignites a hatred deep in me
Knowing I’ll never be happy
Knowing that I’ll never be enough, can’t you see?
It haunts my every single waking dream

But I know you know I’m right
Though we’re different we’re humans deep inside
But without love, or salvation, or kindness, or comfort though, is it really life? no!
Crying when the radio plays a sappy note, pathetic yes I know
One thing’s for sure though
Everything is your fault

I’ve tried but I still don’t understand why
Why is it we have to fight to live our own life
Why I can’t live off doing the one thing I like
I don’t care if my lyrics aren’t quite right
I don’t really care, no

‘Cause I think I’ve got it right
Yeah I know I’ve got it right
Yeah I know I’ve got it right?

But I’ve got it wrong again
I don’t understand
I don’t really care though
Not about humans or truth or the world or this life I hold, I don’t really care, no!
Never giving a reply, just philosophic lines, is just an excuse right?
Not that I care tho
Everything is your fault

Even I had dreams long long ago
Now it doesn’t feel the same as it did before 
I’ve told you time and time again
It didn’t really matter if nothing came of it, you know
You do know, I know you know, now I can’t do it anymore

So now you know why
So now you know why I, don’t do music anymore

歌も声も本当に素晴らしい！！<br>ヨルシカの「風邪を食む」を英語ver.で聞いてみたいです！！
Listening to this track is day ten.
YES OMG I DON&#39;T THINK I&#39;VE EVER SEEN A YORUSHIKA COVER I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Come on guys we should at least be happy she didn’t ACTUALLY give up on music
When my mental health was at it worst, I felt this song in a special way. Thank you for making this beautiful cover.
I don&#39;t know whether or not I want to pursue music since its been few years since I stopped singing... and stopped playing the guitar
I Love This Version ❤
The lyrics thoooo
this song gives me goodbye to rock you by tuyu vibes
🤍
This song hits me hard..
That’s cool！<br>Nice translate✨✨✨✨✨
&quot;Moonlight&quot;
It’s been a while since this has come out, but ever since I first heard this song, I realized I had chosen the wrong path of life by giving up on music. I always grew up with music in my veins and I thought I was going to go to university to become a professional pianist. I didn’t even make it a semester into a different major when I noticed I hated it and there was emptiness in my heart. I dropped everything and decided to pursue some skills that would help me where I want to get to be. I’ll be in a place of new opportunities shortly. It wouldn’t be without your talented cover Rachie! Thank you so much ❤️
I haven’t seen anyone here that has thought of this, nor do I think that anyone will see this, but I really relate this song to Omori. It’s like it describes the story of the game perfectly. It’s almost creepy lol. Seriously, though. “That’s Why I Gave Up On Music” sounds so similar to Sunny’s situation, honestly. He gave up on violin after what happened with Mari, and it describes how “everything is your fault.” It’s like how Sunny constantly blames himself for everything, for Mari’s death, for hurting his friends, for hating himself. It kind of sounds like that part is coming from how Sunny thinks Mari would talk to him, if she was still there with him. He thinks that she would blame her for everything that happened. So he gave up on music, locked it in a closet for 4 years and shut himself in his room.<br><br>“Everything will be okay” is just like, lmao idk how to say it?? It’s literally just “everything is going to be okay,” like what’s repeatedly forced and promised in the game, that everything’s gonna be okay. lol sorry i have a problem, i just really like this song and omori lololol ok bye
nice

とても素晴らしい🫠
二番サビ前の翻訳が綺麗すぎる
I keep getting tongue-tied trying to sing this XD
Why their is no lyrics in Spotify 😭😭😭
AAAAAAA KEREN BANGET KAK!!!
Nostalgia of a string of songs that narrates a story that I never quite understood because of it being in Japanese. All I&#39;ve got to say is that these lyrics are heavily underrated throughout the entirety of the album and am surprised on how little is said about them. Keep up the good work and your work in translations do not go unnoticed!
really good!
Hearing an english cover of this already beautiful song makes me want to keep writing songs with my guitar. Thank you for this cover, hearing you sing makes me look forward to sharing my own music in the future!
英語に翻訳してもヨルシカの雰囲気をここまで<br>再現できるのはめっちゃすごいと思う
This is so underrated. Im a new starting artist and sometimes I cant help to get mad at myself for not doing better than what I expected from myself. This song just makes it better somehow :)
Noce voice, so when you&#39;ll write your own song? Or any links of your own song/s?
bro if she quit music i aint quitting listening to the songs. but fr rachie we love you if you are actually  quitting have a good life.
baru tau kalau kamu dari indonesiaaaa karena dari video cover id:entity PLISSS <br><a href=""https://youtu.be/p_dNjVKttX4"">https://youtu.be/p_dNjVKttX4</a><br>AAAAAAAAAA
the emotion is conveyed so well
Could someone please elaborate what does the lyric &quot;Everything&#39;s your fault.&quot; mean? To whom is &#39;you&#39; referring???
there&#39;s this song and my r, i dont think im gonna get sick of either for a long time
I hope she caught the train... she&#39;s been waiting all day ;n;
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGqY5SQPvs8&amp;t=0m00s"">0:00</a> pog
perhaps the reason why I cant seem to like that one person in my life is because i envy them for being able to make a living out of the things they love....<br>while i&#39;m giving up my only dream.. so that i can still exist in this world
You are literally my favourite coverer (lol I know that this word doesn&#39;t actually exist) you make the best vocaloid covers and your voice&#39;s pitch is perfectiooon<br>I have a suggestion! (please accept it if you can)<br>can you please make a cover for the song echo by crusherP?
Luckily i checked, cause this aint on your yorushika cover playlist
日本語でおk
can relate but instead of music its drawing....
I am literally crying while listening to your cover. This is so emotional.
:) I love this
This song almost made me cry but in a good way
Well it&#39;s been 2 and a half months. I&#39;ll miss these covers.
Noice
This song is a bop it&#39;s sad that Miss Rachie has given up on music hmm I&#39;m just gonna subscribe

Lyrics

on Bandsintown
""Cupid (Twin Version)""

La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
(Cupid is so dumb)

Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
(Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
(I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb
(A fool for love, a fool for love)

LYRICS:
You stay quiet, boy,
I know how you feel
You ain’t gotta hide it, ‘cause
You know you’d be lying, and
We could be something for real
You ain’t gotta fight it, no
You ain’t gotta fight it

Na Na-Na 
Looking at you
Na Na-Na
You know what i’m tryna do
Oh, I know you feel it, so don’t
No don’t keep me waiting here

(Keep me waiting here)
(I’ma wait right here)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

These things I’m thinking
When you’re looking in my eyes
And I can’t control
The way you make me feel inside
And now you know,
You got a hold on my mind
I don’t wanna fight it
Don’t wanna fight
What you’ve done to me now
I want your love on me, love on me now
Give it all to me now

You know that you like it
So why you tryna fight it
I might put it in reverse
Slow it down, then rewind it
Feels like reckless driving
Fuck it, I’m still riding
And if we gon’ crash
At least i’m living while I’m dying

(Keep me waiting here)
(I’ma wait right here)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

These things I’m thinking
When you’re looking in my eyes
And I can’t control
The way you make me feel inside
And now you know,
You got a hold on my mind
I don’t wanna fight it
Don’t wanna fight
What you’ve done to me now
I want your love on me, love on me now
Give it all to me now

Who is the white haired lady? Never seen her
This song is very good in both versions ❤❤❤❤❤
Love this
NO WONDER THEY CHOSE THIS SONG I GET IT
Ever think about the songs from the Ikki Tousen series? I think it would be awesome to hear those songs in english. Like Driving Though the Night, Heart &amp; Soul, No x Limit, and whatever else is on the list. Although I personally enjoy Garasu no Hana.
What the hell I’ve been listening to other versions for ages same intro different translations
this is so good its equally good with the og it&#39;s a bop
I&#39;m listening to this today and I have to say AmaLee sounds so much like LiSa. i love both their vocals .
Boom😚
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Japanese is better
Hi AMaLee my name is Andrew. I am a big fan of your work and your voice acting is so super awesome you totally rule :D AMALEE :D &lt;3
It&#39;s 2023 😂😅😊 it&#39;s still a masterpiece.
As a huge fan of Demon Slayer, finally having a English version makes me feel happy 🥲Continue Doing What You Do!
Thanks because I was trying to sing this in japenese
What&#39;s the breath style of that female demon slayer character? Tbh she looks like a fodder demon slayer npc.
say what you want but the english and japanese are fire and her voice definetly matches the japanese&#39;s version
&quot;Finally you&#39;ve given me a reason to be strong, And we&#39;ll stand hand in hand to the end.&quot; Eighteen words, eighteen simple words that sums up the entire story of Demon Slayer. The story of the Kamado siblings, so incredibly loyal to each other. Tanjiro NEVER gave up on Nezuko, and Nezuko KNEW that her place was at her brother&#39;s side. It was a long road, full of death and pain. But they stayed together through it all, and they walked that road with loyal if somewhat quirky friends. Zenitsu, the would be coward who became a legitimate hero and the man Tanjiro would one day call his brother in law. Inosuke, despite his brutish demeanor at first, would become one of the most loyal companions anyone could have. Tanjiro&#39;s greatest strength was his empathy for others. This earned him the respect of his fellow Slayers, and the love of Kanao, the woman who would become his wife. All of it started because Tanjiro would not give up on Nezuko, they were each other&#39;s reason for living and they earned their happy ending. A lesson we all can learn from. Family matters, even if you don&#39;t always get along with them. True friends are more valuable than silver, gold, or platinum. So treasure them as such.
I’ve been wondering<br>The English version like what is it in English the demon slayer theme song <br>And finally you did it I’ve been wondering, almost this whole month and last month 😂
1. Finally you have given me a reason to be strong.<br>2.This world can beat me down hundred times but into light i always rise<br>The above two are the perfect line for the song because it&#39;s shows the whole personality of Tanjiro(Demon Slayer MC)<br>In line 1 he get a reason to strong for save his sister and in the second line show no matter how many times tanjiro damaged in battle but he always stand up to protect people and his sister and friends ( Thats why i love the Tanjiro as a Main Character) <br>And in my opinion Tanjiro is one of the best MC in an anime he is really a kind hearted man and i believe nobody able to hate him
Sick song
did you actually sing this??? if you did u have a great voice!
can u pls do season 3 opening of demon slayer Man on a misson x millet

写歌的人用了脑，唱歌的人用了心，听歌的人用了情，有故事的人流了泪，初听不知曲中意，再听已识曲中人，愿大家只听曲中曲，不做曲中人.
希望正在聽這首歌的會考生們可以考到自己想要的學校，考的全會，猜的全對，相信自己，所向披靡，不要小看自己，最後祝大家有個好成績，讓我們一起加油~~前往自己想要的學校
好聽，感謝．

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whatshappeninginmyanmar"">#WhatsHappeningInMyanmar</a><br>Yet another terrifying crime committed by Myanmar air force.<br>Myanmar’s junta chief Min Aung Hlaing promised to crush the resistance movement. This is how &quot;crush the resistance movement&quot; looks like - macabre scenes of dead and burned bodies of the civilians, with children among them, killed with bombs and indiscriminate firing from the air.    <br>At least 50 people, probably even much more, were killed in junta air raid on Pazigyi Village in Sagaing Region. Junta aircraft dropped two bombs and MI35 helicopters strafed the village as people were either attending the opening of a People’s Authority Office or participating in the charity event (it is still not quite clear what has been the purpose of gathering).<br>Such atrocities will continue as long as Myanmar neighbors, relevant regional players, ASEAN, US, UK and EU do not change their approach to state terror which junta is over two years inflicting on the people of the country.<br>Indonesia as ASEAN chair is claiming that it is running behind the scene silent diplomacy with &quot;all stakeholders&quot;. Such approach is ineffective, it is just giving the time to junta to continue with its terror. <br>Thailand is the main source of USD revenues trough ongoing payments of gas from Myanmar. It is not necessary to be so. Junta is illegitimate entity with no rightful claims to be the government of the country. Thai state energy company can put payments to the fund that is out of reach of junta till the violence and war is stopped .<br>India and China are actively engaging junta, discussion investments and offering various other forms of assistance. Russia and Pakistan are providing assistance with planes and helicopters. <br>December&#39;s Burma Act passed by Congress have to Biden administration more maneuvering space to act, but administration is always acting too slow, too little , too late.<br>Condemnation of war crimes and crimes against humanity will not help. Slow pace and limited sanctions neither. People of Myanmar, legitimate National Unity Government and anti-junta resistance need resolute, quick and concrete assistance NOW.<br>Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing does not have intention to stop - unless he is stopped. <br>Junta chief recently approved a military budget of more than 5.6 trillion kyats (around US$2.7 billion) for the 2023-24 fiscal year, which begins in April, up from 3.7 trillion kyats last year. This money has been largely provided from revenues coming from selling gas and other natural resources to different Asian markets.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savemyanmarcitizens"">#SaveMyanmarCitizens</a>

Karol G & Shakira - TQG // English Translation,"Karol G, Shakira - TQG (Mañana será bonito, 2023) English Subs/Lyrics

Lyrics:
[Letra de ""TQG""]

[Intro: KAROL G]
La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona te miente
Es como tapar una herida con maquillaje, no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste (Ey) y te conseguiste nueva novia (Novia)
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía me está' viendo toa' la historia' (No; papi)

[Coro: KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue?, ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (-íto')
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? Si sabes que yo errores no repito (Ey, papi)
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Verte con la nueva me dolió (Dolió)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Shakira]
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte (Ah)
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy más dura dicen los reporte'
Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota (Ah)
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

[Coro: Shakira & KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al menos yo te tenía bonito (Shakira, Shakira)

[Verso 3: Shakira & KAROL G]
Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M
Más buena, más dura, más leve
Volver contigo never, tú eres la mala suerte
Porque ahora la' bendicione' me llueven
Y quiere' volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía
Tú buscando por fuera la comida
Yo diciendo que era monotonía
Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía (A la mía)
Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida
Pero si ella supiera que me busca' todavía

[Coro: KAROL G & Shakira]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito (Mueve el culito)
Que no tiene buena mano, y al menos yo te tenía bonito
[Outro: KAROL G]
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Mi amor, es que usted se alejó mucho
Y yo de lejos ya no veo, bebé
TQM pero TQG, jajaja

Fell in love with this song

This video is cropped so you can’t see their full body in the sexiest parts. Like when Blockbuster edited  out one of the sins in “Seven” with Pitt &amp; Paltrow. My video only had 6 sins. Lol.
What does tqg mean
She&#39;s legend of the year ❤
Thank you for this. I love this song. Kinda knew what it was about due to the media and my friends telling me. But this makes me experience this song fully. Thank you. 🐐
Do Shakira-Acróstico 🥲😍
So I&#39;ve been vibing to a song that&#39;s made by two chicks shit-talking to their ex? 😂 Oh god, the coping is real
Shakira&#39;s voice🔥
This song works so well with Shakira <br>Yassss 🎉❤😊<br><br>Ty lord for Eng subs ^_^
Absolutely love this! Both of them did such a amazing job with this 🔥🔥
They hit the mark with the beat but the dancing and lyrics are weak
I am so tired... Of her complaining at him. Bad things happen to all people. She needs to accept it and gracefully move forward. With  love 🌷
Así es ... Latin power... fuck tramposos, una mujer vale oro y no la valoran
The hardest diss track ever created

Por fin siento el placer de las personas que hablan inglés que tengan que usar subtitulos
Muchas gracias para el traduccion de inglés! Qué significa ‘TQG?’
I don&#39;t compete for men! Amen, gurls 🎉❤

To be very honest the song not so great. It sounds less gospel I wish he had mentioned the name of Jesus in the song and add more about his love and protection. I did not like the song.
Thanks a lot ✊🏽
Boa nova eu .Paulo escolhi esta imagem que foi gravado nas minhas mãos o caminho da salvação dado pelo pai que é deus já que muitos dizem que sabem ler a cronologia das linhas das mãos não se esqueçam todos estão marcados por deus nas vossas mãos o destino escolhem bem o vosso caminho para não se perderem na tentação porque o poder não chega à salvação da alma um grande abraço ao povo de deus ❤
GOD works in mysterious ways, using music to reach the world the same method the devil tries to use. <br><br>This prayer song has been played in clubs around the world, and I&#39;m glad the lyrics didn&#39;t come out until it was already viral.
Fast and furious... gone in 60 seconds 😰☠😈👹

▶ Lyrics Bizarrap

Bizarrap & Shakira - 'Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53': English Translation
INTRO
(For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
(For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Sorry, I already took another plane
I'm not coming back here, I don't want another disappointment
So much that you pretend to be a champion
And when I needed you, you gave your worst version
Sorry, baby, it's been a while
I should have thrown that cat away
A she-wolf like me ain't for a rookie

CHORUS
A she-wolf like me ain't for dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh

VERSE 1
I do this for you to mortify, chew and swallow, swallow and chew
I'm not coming back to you, even if you're crying or begging
I understood that it's not my fault you're criticized
I only make music, I'm sorry I splashed you
You left me as a neighbour to the mother-in-law
With the press at the door and the debt at the IRS
You thought you'd hurt me, but you made me tougher
Women don't cry anymore, women invoice

PRE-CHORUS
He's got a good person's name
Clearly, it's not what it sounds like
He's got a good person's name
Clearly

CHORUS
She's just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with one just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh

VERSE 2
From love to hate, there's only one step
This way don't come back, listen to me
No hard feelings, baby, I wish you the best with my supposed replacement
I don't even know what happened to you
You're so weird that I can't even tell you apart
I'm worth two 22's
You traded a Ferrari for a Twingo
You traded a Rolex for a Casio
You're going fast, slow down
Ah, a lot of gym
But workout your brain a little too
Pictures wherever I am
I feel like a hostage here, it's all right with me
I'll let you go tomorrow and if you want to bring her along, bring her along too

PRE-CHORUS
He's got a good person's name (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Clearly, it's not what it sounds like (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
He's got a good person's name (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

CHORUS
And a she-wolf like me ain't for dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

OUTRO
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (For dudes, fo-fo-for dudes like–)
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (For dudes, fo-fo-for dudes like–)
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

This is my alarm tone 😀
You thought You&#39;d show the Whites How good your fighter pilots are? So they Like You.<br>The Whites are more Intelligent than You. Your bi-Lingual, Hindi is Complicated than English. Furthermore You Learn Both.<br>In Addition, India is a Hot Country. I remember My Camping Trip Visit in 2008.<br>I remember Landing at Islamabad, Sikhastaan. I remember the Heat. It was as though You&#39;re Swimming in Heat. Unbearable. About 37 degrees. When we Got to the Dam, the Breeze from the Dam brought it Down to 30 Degrees. Hot But bareable.<br>Anything Over 20 Degrees, and Your Brain won&#39;t be able to think Properly. I think people that Live in Hot Countries would be able to Think properly up to 25 degrees.<br>Those Whites are More Intelligent than You. Its just Your Millions of Times Bigger.<br>Two Indian software developers will beat One White software developer.<br>However, one on One, they&#39;ll Win.

Lyrics:
Wreaking havoc on the media, she smiles bright
There’s a secret that she has that seems to mystify
Always in her area, yet never feeling quite alright
So perfect as a liar, you are really my
Flawless, genius idol for life

So, tell me what you ate, the books you read today
And tell me where you’d like to go if only you could play
“I didn’t even eat,” “I’d never spill the beans”
No matter what you ask of her, she’ll find a way to flee

So plain and meek, but also bright and deep
Those little secrets seem seductive, sweet, and almost clear to see
Well, that’s a no, no, no
And this is no, no, no
Come and tell me what’s your type? And what’s he like?
Tell me now, alright?

“Oh, to love and feel so loved, it always seems I alone wouldn’t know what that is or what it means”
Unaware of what’s the truth and what’s a lie
Only for those words that blind, you’re falling deeper till you find
You make them love you every time

Everyone, their eyes are taken by your sight
You’re a bright, unrivaled, perfect kind of idol
None will find another in this life
You’re the first starlight, reborn through the night

Ah, you smile and deceive, you make them all believe you really mean “I love you” as you never set them free
And even if those eyes or the words are lies, I only find that, deep inside, you’re the real Ai

Yeah, yeah, she is special and she always shines
We have only been her extras, always left behind
Acting as a foil to the star on stage, we’re B, alright
There’s no way that everything we have is ‘cuz of all her lies

This isn’t right, you should feel envy you can’t hide
This isn’t fine, this is no joke in my eyes, I’ll never forgive you this time
You’re damaged and I couldn’t forgive you inside, forgive myself in my mind
You are so brave and so bright, nobody else could ever be mine

Everyone is blind, believing all your lies
You’re the best, unrivaled, perfect kind of idol
None can find a weakness deep inside
And you take the starlight all through the night

She just can’t show she’s weak, ‘cuz no one really, really
Wants to know or see the things she’s keeping buried
Special things she likes, she’ll always carry, carry
And that’s surely, truly, really Ai

Always stirring up the media, she smiles bright
There’s a secret that she really has to keep inside
Lies piling high, till “I love you” is her very life
That’s exactly just the kind of love I’m calling mine

To my darling little Aqua, through the sweat, you shine
To my precious little Ruby that this eyelid hides
Singing and then dancing, I am Mary and I’m so divine
Yeah, just the finest love is made from pretty lies

I have yet to feel so loved for being me
And I still haven’t loved any other soul I meet
But I still believe this lie will set me free
It’ll be, as I dreamed, the truth, you will see
That is my belief

One day, I’m sure I’ll have it all because I found
I’m a rash, unbridled, greedy kind of idol
I just wanna love without a doubt
Wanna love as me, so I let them out

Those lies, again I try to hide
I’m wishing for a time I’ll even find these words are true within my own life
But even so, I’ll say
You’re the only ones I haven’t even said this to ‘cuz I’m afraid

Ah, kind of overdue, I finally said it too, and it’s really true
I love you two",2641828,79192,2017,2023-04-24T16:00:07Z,"WATCH OSHI NO KO AND STREAM THIS ON SPOTIFY <a href=""https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/idol"">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/idol</a>

To be honest, I love this one more, not because I hate the other ver but this makes more sense and more english like!
思わず、英語カヴァーをしてしまうほど、この曲に魅了されたんですね！<br>ありがとうございます。<br><br>日本語の歌詞と音に近寄ったYOASOBIの英語verも好きですが、こちらも良いですね！
Wow these lyrics are so much better than the official English version! Your lyrics actually feel painful to hear and think about, a real stinging sensation that feels jarring in the best way! And it continues through the whole song with no mercy! Brilliant!
Ai Supremacy!!!💜👑
you have an amazing voice😍
Hello it is I Ai
ngl this sounds fire but i wonder what would happen if u got a girl to voice this over
WHAT THE FUCK RAP33D MY EARS

Why is this better then the original English version?
The Turkhis translation of this song better than what it says, but I think it&#39;s pretty good too,congratulations😊😊
Was the show good it got alot of attention I havent watched it this season.
Imagine if he did a cover of Mephisto, i think he’ll do great on that as well.
Fun fact: right after this came out the english version come out from the original creator
&quot;I love you TWO&quot;<br>oh guess i&#39;m sad now ;_;
I love how this sounds like it is all from Aqua&#39;s perspective, making it it just feel so unique to this version itself
I always misheard &quot;And you take&quot; as Andrew Tate STOP

I&#39;ve been listening to this song for about a month now.
I feel like this could be a cover made by Aqua lol

Your song are better than the original one

está canción me recuerda a mi abuelita, siento una tristeza enorme al escuchar esta canción.
Para dedicar &quot;&quot;yo de peque me la aprendi completa crellendo que estaba en español 😕🙂
Se la dedico a mi novia que murió en mis brazos
Ver qué le dedican esta canción a dos supuestos meses de estar. Y yo llorando nosé por qué 😢 duele cuando uno amó tanto de verdad
Bonita cancion
😍😍
Yo sé la dedico a quien esté triste como yo a nadie le deseo la tristeza 😊
Aprendiendo inglés con este método ed lo mejor
Que bellas historias estoy leyendo y cuánta gente con una gran capacidad de superar y entender lo que el mundo, dios, el destino, la vida o como quieran llamarlo les está preparando. Es primera vez que oigo esta canción y no se a quien dedicárselo, ni tampoco se él mensaje que tiene esta.
Simplemente todo está bien. Just everything is fine
Es muy buena
muy bonita cancion , me encanta❤
Yo ahora 🌑💔💔🖤❤️‍🩹🥀🥀🥀
Todos desahogándose y yo aprendiendo inglés con la canción xd😂

Hermosa cansion
Yo se la dedico a mi mamá por todo lo que significa en mi vida, ella me esta apoyando en todo, y desde aquí le puede decir a mi mamá, Gracias por darme un abrazo cuando más lo necesito ♥️
Esta canción la anduve buscando por años :00000
I’m just here because I want to learn English. That’s it…
buena  cancion a de una keane
OMG, Bella letra.:)
Me la dedico la persona más importante en mi vida, y tengo la suerte de que siga a mi lado, es y siempre será mi hermoso universo
Enero 2023 alguien lo está escuchando???no puede ser q sea el único!!!

►Lyrics
Il était brun, le teint basané
Le regard timide, les mains toutes abîmées
Il taillait la pierre, fils d'ouvier
Il en était fier, mais pourquoi vous riez?

Non, ne le jugez pas
Vous qui ne connaissez pas
Les vertiges et le labeur
Vous êtes faussement heureux, vous troquez vos valeurs

Lui, il est tout mon monde et bien plus que ça
Seule, je crie son nom quand vient le désarroi
Et puis tout s'effondre quand il n'est plus là
J'aimerais tellement lui dire mais je n'ose pas
Lui qui me fait

Tourner dans le vide, vide
Tourner dans le vide, vide
Tourner dans le vide, il me fait tourner
Dans le vide, vide, vide
Tourner, tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide, il me fait tourner

Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide

Qui peut bien me dire ce qui est arrivé?
Depuis qu'il est parti, je n'ai pu me relever
Ce n'est plus qu'un souvenir, une larme du passé
Coincée dans mes yeux, qui ne veut plus s'en aller

Oh non, ne riez pas
Vous qui ne connaissez pas
Les vertiges et la douleur
Ils sont superficiels, ils ignorent tout du cœur

Lui, c'était tout mon monde et bien plus que ça
J'espère le revoir là-bas dans l'au-delà
Aidez-moi, tout s'effondre puisqu'il n'est plus là
Sais-tu mon bel amour, mon beau soldat
Que tu me fais

Tourner dans le vide, vide?
Tourner dans le vide, vide?
Tourner dans le vide, tu me fais tourner
Dans le vide, vide, vide
Tourner, tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide, il me fait tourner

Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide

Il me fait tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Il me fait tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Tourner dans le vide
Il me fait tourner...
Tourner dans le vide...




►Lyrics (English)

[Verse 1]
He was dark-haired, a tanned complexion
A bashful gaze and all damaged hands
He was cutting stones, Worker's son
He was proud of it, but why are you laughing?
No, do not judge him
You, who do not know
Dizziness, and toil
You are falsely happy, you are trading your values

[Bridge 1]
He is my whole world, and much more than that
Alone, I shout out his name, when comes the disarray
And then everything is falling apart, when he is not here anymore
I would like so much to tell him, but I dare not
He makes me...
[Chorus]
Turn into the empty, the empty
Turn into the empty, the empty
Turn into the empty, he makes me turn
Into the empty, the empty, the empty
Turn, turn into the empty
Turn into the empty, he makes me turn
Turn into the empty...

[Verse 2]
Who could tell me what happened?
Since he left, I could not recover again
It is just a memory now, a tear from the past
Wedged in my eyes, which do not want to go away anymore
Oh no, do not laugh
You, who do not know
Dizziness and pain
They are superficials, are ignorant of everything about Heart

[Bridge 2]
He was my whole world, and much more than that
I wish I see him there in the Hereafter
Help me, everything is falling apart because he is not here anymore
Do you know my fair love, my beautiful soldier...
That you make me...
You might also like
Blind
SZA
Circo Loco
Drake & 21 Savage
Unholy
Sam Smith & Kim Petras
[Chorus]
Turn into the empty, the empty
Turn into the empty, the empty
Turn into the empty, you make me turn
Into the empty, the empty, the empty
Turn, turn into the empty
Turn into the empty, he makes me turn
Turn into the empty...

[Outro]
He makes me turn into the empty
Turn into the empty, turn into the empty
He makes me turn into the empty
Turn into the empty, turn into the empty
Turn into the empty, he makes me turn
Turn into the empty

Lyrics 

i may not be able to ever say this to your face
i hope you understand, i really do
yeah maybe one day i’ll meet you again in another way
and i will guide you till you make it through 

 without you… i don’t know how to live
without youuu…. it is so hard to live 
but all i know..,i don’t want better or anything worse than you
cause without you…. i  don’t know what i am
yeah without you… i am not what i a-am 
but all i know is.. I don’t want any worse or even better than you

you make my eyes dream about you
they ask me how someone like you
could be so beautiful and I
i tell my self it’s true

I pretend i’m busy all the time
so in love i come and say goodbye
no matter where i am going i 
always try to pass you by

and baby know that… i won’t stop trying for you
yes baby please know that… i’ll never stop loving you
but all i know..,i don’t want worse or even better than you
cause without you…. i  don’t know     what i am
yeah without you… i am not what i am 
but all i know is.. I don’t want worse or even better than you

without youuuuuuu
without you
without you

What a beautiful piece of music! I feel so refreshed and rejuvenated after listening to it.
To anybody who&#39;s reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life.
To anyone who is doing this challenge, we both in this, so don&#39;t give up. When you feel like you you want to give up and you can go no more, tell yourself &quot;look how far I have come I can keep going to reach my goal&quot; we all in this struggle together through thick and thin.
To everyone studying/working for something in his/her life to happen… be sure that it’s going to be great, what ever your struggling with… it will turn out to be good! What ever happens.. happens! Most importantly keep faith and positivity in your self because that will help keep you up and strong!
❤❤❤❤
Music is an enchanting thing love music all❤
Whoever is reading my comment at this time, we are unknown to each other, but I still pray to God that if you have any tension going on in your life right now, then it should go away and you should always be happy, And may God bless their parents with all the happiness in the world.❤❤❤",PT2H9M24S

Lyrics:
So, here I see such an ordinary night
The city lights, the noises, and the you I find

Again, the clock’s face is all frozen in time
The cluttered room stays as a place to drop on by
While nothing else changed, looking back, I came to find
We’ve been blind and gotten older in this life

Again, the beat fades, but the music remains
It’s always replayed, so we’re bored of that refrain
While nothing else changed, I’m begging, don’t change
In the end, you are the only one who stayed

While we watch what we say, chatting on without aim
We can’t bring ourselves to talk of the issue we face
While we stop and retry, pushing forth both the hands of our time 
Our breathing starts to fall in line, yours and mine

So, here I see such an ordinary night
The city lights, the noises, and the you I find, dancing by
So, here I see such an ordinary night, ah
I want you by my side

That lovely, pale shade, which your skin always takes
That smile won’t break, not a care within its shape
While nothing else changed, I’m begging, don’t change
I’m afraid that this is only for today

Staring only lets me see overflowing memories
A heart, swaying for a lonely coffee and
With a messy room and scene, with a scratchy melody
Let’s blend as one and breathe, saying really

So, here I see such an ordinary night
My heart on high, my pleasure, and the you I find, dancing by
So, here I see such an ordinary night, ah
I want you by my side

I know that the night lasts a longer time
Any kind of music could stop with no sign
Oh, if I could try drowning by your side
Even if tomorrow’s a lie, then that’s just fine

So, here I see such an ordinary night
The city lights, the noises, and the you I find, dancing by
So, here I see such an ordinary night, ah
Ah, ha, love me, darlin’

So, look at me only, who would care or mind
Let’s sway in time and stumble beneath the starlight, dancing by
So, here I see such an ordinary night, ah
I want you by my side",931172,33045,565,2023-04-02T16:00:10Z,"YES i sang a lyric wrong at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX8JmX-PJ8k&amp;t=0m37s"">0:37</a>, the right words are &quot;in this life,&quot; not &quot;all this time...&quot; my bad.........<br>listen on spotify tho <a href=""https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/night-dancer"">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/night-dancer</a>

Will&#39;s voice is perfect for the English cover for night danger like it&#39;s perfect!!
Been listening to this on replay fr
my absolute favorite part is how the way it is sung matches the original! I loved the sound of the original but I couldn&#39;t understand the words which sucked, so when I heard a clip of this on TikTok I had to hear the full thing, albeit I was somewhat hesitant that I wouldn&#39;t be the same BUT he also kinda sounds like imase which is cool! Im happy I found this cause I can understand it now!
I was boutta say this cover is perfect and then also realized that it is Will Stetson! I love your songs/song covers!!!!

Work out mode bro.. always here basta work out mode.
Love the fact that it&#39;s not loaded with commercial content 👌.  Will continue to thumbs up and support the channel.  Music is appropriate for the work-out.
It&#39;s sad it&#39;s sad an artist like this is not on the top 100 billboards, that he&#39;s not out being broadcast for the world to see, this man&#39;s words are truly inspirational and I&#39;ve been listening to them for the last few days workout or not, I wake up and put this on we need more people that speak the truth like this,holla.
Great mix. How do you find the artist/song list if you don&#39;t have Spotify?

Lyrics:
Marinette/Ladybug:
On the day time
I'm Marinette
Just a normal girl
With a normal life
But there's something about me
That no one knows yet
Cause I have secret
Another day,
I'm back at school
I think about him, he's so cool
He looks at me, I look away
But does he see me anyway
Oh, Oh, Oh
He's got me spinning round
Oh, Oh, Oh
My feet are off the ground
Oh, Oh, Oh
And when the sun goes down
That's when I become
Miraculous!
Simply the best!
Up to the test, when things go wrong
Miraculous!
The luckiest!
The power of love, always so strong!
Adrien/Cat Noir:
I am a cat, just chilling out
But in the night, she's all I think about
I feel so strong, when she's around
She picks me up, when I am down
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh no you'll never know!
Oh, Oh, Oh
My love can only grow
Oh, Oh, Oh
And when I see her smile
That's when she becomes
Marinette/Ladybug:
Miraculous!
Simply the best!
Up to the test, when things go wrong!
Marinette (Adrien):
Miraculous! (Miraculous!)
The luckiest! (Oh Oh)
The power of love, always so strong!
Marinette/Ladybug:
Miraculous!
Simply the best!
Up to the test when things go wrong!

just played orb dancer, stacks on stacks, cast to last Octavia on Ahten City, imagine if I got chronoboost and egoist that would be the wet dream, going mach 20
actual banger
I’ve watched so much content of this game including character trailers and songs. This summer I’m downloading it to play and I’m really excited! Even watched a video on how to play, I think I’ll love this!
This track is such a banger it wants to make learn how do produce music myself. And Demondice as vocals turns this from a 10/10 up to 12/10
I would <b>LOVE</b> an Easteregg of the vocals having a chance to kick in after right after Vyce / Octavia score a goal during a Set that has their theme playing.<br><br>Everyone would love it! ❤
Yeah, I like her more
Great song! The game and its development dosent stop to suprise me, its absolutely stunning how great it is. The game was shown to me by a friend during beta and I thought it would be pretty mid, I am not very good at this type of games, but the way its played and how cute all the characters and emotes are made me stick for longer and i just couldnt wait for full realse, and now i am truly hooked. Keep up the good work! PS. Team Octavia forever &lt;3
I really hope this game continues for a long time. It’s really fun.
You could say.... she reaped it. :P
I never would have expected Electric Dice Music but here we are
i cant believe how much of a banger this is, let alone the rest of the soundtrack.<br>this is freaking great
Omg these songs are certified BANGERS<br><br>I still really love how much care is put into this game and am looking forward to whats in the future :D
I fucking love demondice theres no fucking way this is real. I love you omega strikers god bless you
Can y&#39;all make this into a PlayStation Theme ?! 🤔👀🎶
I kept thinking about DEMONDICE when ever Demon Dais would pop up, and here we are.<br><br>What the crap.
WE’RE STRIKING IT DOWN AND HYPING UP THE CROWD WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
Ngl I&#39;ve been having this on repeat. Thanks for the gym motivation.
Can you find any other game that does this? Ill wait...NO
Damn this song is great. Almost makes me sad I picked rock even though that song is also a banger. Great job by Karen on the vocals.
❤ This EDM is 🔥
Sounds like this should be a part of Rocket Leagues playlist!
I expected no better fit than DEMONDICE herself for this bop.<br>Both the English and Japanese versions are absolutely amazing~<br>&gt;W&lt;)
I want an animaaaayyyyyy
This song passed Vice Versa in views LET&#39;S GOOOO💕
I started playing this game today because of this ABSOLUTE BANGER. DEMONDICE is by far my favorite artist out there and the game is absolutely fantastic. Def an Octavia main.
I wish this was released a day sooner. I picked Rock but would had totally chosen EDM if I had :(
DEMONDICE is lit I love every song in this game.
This song is epic amazing
I&#39;m just saying, as someone who loves this game with all their heart, this made me tear up. It is so good, and it really shows just how much Odyssey cares about their game, it&#39;s universe, and the community that&#39;s come to it. <br><br>Omega Strikers is amazing, and huge props to Odyssey, Demondice, and everyone else who works on this absolute masterpiece of a game!<br><br>I absolutely cannot wait to see what comes next for OS ❤
Also i just realised that Octavia isn&#39;t probably singing this song. Some Dj&#39;s do but some don&#39;t that&#39;s probably why christina vee doesn&#39;t sing it.
NGL the lyrics don&#39;t add up. The &quot;Oh I just got a feeling I&#39;m sleeping at 10 past 6 and i&#39;ve got a feeling my ceiling is high up in space. those 2 are the most confusing to me but there are a few others that the works make sense i guess cause of the lore but they aren&#39;t put in a order that makes sense. like rhythm and reason, i&#39;m healing i won&#39;t be replaced feels like it&#39;s just 3 different lines put together without being connected in some way. i don&#39;t mind it and at least the singing in this one is good.
ddk did amazing on this holy shit 😵‍💫
Ive been tryna think of an &quot;odyssey has a purpose&quot; meme for ages but non of it makes any sense
When can call cali cooperative with demondice wwwww
Ive been playing this on repeat on my way to work today, its so good!<br><br>Keep up the great music as always, think this theme is my 2nd favorite, I love Ai. mis theme the most still!
DDK fan here. I love this song so much, been looping it since yesterday. I&#39;ve started to play Omega Strikers because of this song. Team EDM Let&#39;s GOOOOOO!!
me on my way to download a game just because DDK han a song on it
Today Demondice, soon i hope actual vtuber collabs!! Oh god the idea gets me hype! Imagine chars with my fav vtubers skins! I hope Omega Strikers KEEPS popping off so this comes true ❤
Man Odyssey really know what demographic to target and how to target it! A song with DEMONDICE is just an inspired level of marketing!
Was not expecting to hear DEMONDICE on an edm track but I couldn&#39;t have been pleasantly surprised; amazing job from everyone on the project! 💕
I love the lyrics so much I want to make a chilled out ukulele piece with it. DEMONDICE did spectacular on this ❤
God I love all of this games music
This song is such a banger! I’m definitely going to begin using this on my gaming music! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamedm"">#TeamEDM</a>, this song fits so well with Octavia, I love it!
Which song is better? Thousand Absolutes or Vice Versa?
Dropped a banger song then added Demondice to it, like chocolate and peanut butter 😍
Its so damn good😭
Common DDK banger
Both songs will be on spotify in the future? 🥺
I wasnt sure until listening to this but I&#39;m definitely on Team EDM!",PT3M2S

The English Beat - Mirror In The Bathroom [Official Music Video] - HQ,"Check out this official video for The English Beat song ""Mirror In The Bathroom"". You can grab The Complete Beat from Shout! Factory at: http://www.shoutfactory.com/product/complete-beat-bonus-cddvd

Hailing from working-class Birmingham, England, The English Beat entered the music scene in the 1979 in a time of social, political and musical upheaval. Into this storm came they came, trying to calm the waters with their simple message of love and unity set to a great dance Beat. The six member band consisted of singer/songwriter Dave Wakeling (vocals & guitar), Andy Cox (guitar), David Steele (bass), Everett Morton (drums), Saxa (saxophone) and Ranking Roger (toasting). The band managed to fuse all of their respective musical influences - soul, reggae, pop and punk - into a unique sound that was highly danceable. Along with contemporaries such as The Specials, The Selecter and Madness, The English Beat became one of the most popular and influential bands of the British Ska movement. Over the course of the three albums, The English Beat achieved great success in their home country, charting several singles into the top 10.

One of my favs from the time.... Guess we&#39;ll be smashing our retirement homes up to this if they pull any more of that pandemic dying alone sh!t!
I love this tune. The video is pretty good. Nice and honest in that early 80s &quot;we just don&#39;t have any money&quot; way. <br><br>One thing I have to say, though, is the &quot;mirror&quot; scenes are shot in a public toilet, not a bathroom. They are not the same thing at all.
Question-- British people don&#39;t say &quot;bathroom.&quot;  They say &quot;the toilets.&quot; Or some other nickname.  But &quot;the bathroom&quot; is the place you take a bath. So if they say &quot;bathroom&quot; for &quot;the toilets&quot; it&#39;s because they&#39;re translating for an American audience-- is that what The Beat was doing here?
Excelente
Im sat outside in the the sun in  2023 and can still say what a tune
Took the roots of Jamaican music and progressed the form.
Timeless!!!!
This sounds so good blasting out the car stereo with the windows down on a sunny day
I never knew what Ska music was at 15 years old when the song came out. I didn&#39;t have MTV back then so I managed to go to my friends houses to watch the English beat on MTV. IM 56 now still listening  to the Beat.
I remember dressing up as a ska myself and a few of my friend&#39;s back in the early 80s,white shirt black skinny tie black trousers white socks and college loafers with the tossles heading to our local disco in a small village here in ireland and we thought we were the coolest,this great song brings back great memories along with the specials and  UB40,great British bands from that generation.
The best thing about England is that adverts are for amusement only.
its a brilliant piece, exceptional rhythm, very tight, perfect sax, video obviously ignoring them...... shame... id love if they had focused on them..... complex thoughts
Ska&#39;s answer to &#39;Cocaine&#39;.
My favorite from the English Beat. Pure Time Travel fuel.
oof...
We had this magazine selling scheme at my primary school and then you could buy stuff. I always bought music. I bought this album and others for no reason, but I was always happy.
This tune is has haunting has my metal illness 9 - 5, can you hear me at the back?
Hurrah. There is now available at massive expense a drug that gives you time to pretend you give a shit about your mum or dad.
The original Beat
How do you you react to dissatisfaction? I can make it work.
This was my top tune at an early age, cant explain why. And I think the lead singer  was my first band crush thing. I just thought he was impossibly handsome. I think I just liked the the beat(get it). Bopping and all that at some kids Xmas disco paid for my Dads engineering company in Manchester, England , back in the Eighties.
This ska track was really the epitome of style and expression. It had a pure-tone that few other ska two-tone tracks had. It may also be the production quality but seriously, this track still does it for me after all this time.
Superb band.. an absolute cracker  x
Remember this tune from the school disco..... loving it then and now. Ska n 2tone the very best of British...
Went to see The Beat last weekend. The whole place was dancing it up...
...Drift gently into mental illness...<br><br>What a great line!
First video I ever saw when I first saw MTV in 1981
Token on the drums.
I be skankin since 1988? Ha , love it❤😂
Born, &#39;72, this be my youth, hadn&#39;t a clue about racism just great feelin dance vibes❤
This song makes doing coke so cool.
Dance Craze is out on blu ray and it&#39;s a stonker
&quot;It&#39;s not me!&quot;
such a great track. real attitude... and that bass line....!!!
rip Ranking Roger
Grosse Pointe Blank brought me to this awesome song and band.
❤️
The performance space and “bathroom” (as they call it) is the Rum Runner club in Birmingham (Broad Street). The place where Duran Duran started.<br>I apologise if I am repeating any past comments, I did a quick look through and didn’t see anything that mentioned it but there are so many.
I&#39;m in heaven, seriously.
Basically a travesty
RIP Ranking Roger 🙏🏾🕊️
Excellent  x
Grosse Pointe Blank
My eight year old can appreciate this some music is universal and timeless.
R.I.P. Rankin Roger. Started out as a drummer in a punk rock band. Legend!
Love it
Man this song never gets old. I still remember like it was yesterday when I was growing up in the woods just holding on out the window or on the running boards flying down the dirt roads and trails just getting smacked or pelted by rocks.  we always had a ska track playing or some old country, rock, or alternative while we held on for dear life and just laughing away. Still makes me smile

I&#39;m recently learning Spanish and I searched up the English lyrics of this song for studying and gaining some more knowledge in Spanish but now I&#39;m traumatized 🙂
When you’re not a native Spanish speaker, and you find out the English lyrics to this, but you still proceeded to listen to it and jam out as much as you have a floor even though you know what it actually means you still second in Spanish anyway
Me as an American and after learning the lyrics: 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😳😳😳😳😳🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 And im gonna tell my teacher to stop play this song in front of 9 year olds 💀

Yu Yu Hakusho Full Opening Song English,This is the full opening theme shown at the start of the show and at the last episode.  The song is Smile Bomb.,3614039,31607,2961,2008-07-25T22:58:17Z,"One of the best in anime history
This song makes me happy.
Who sings this?
I know this is almost twice as old as me and it&#39;s a song about a middle schooler that fights demons but the lyrics just resonate with what I&#39;m going through and how I feel
Here in hope’s of a remake being released
It&#39;s been 20 years since I first heard this song, but this song can still get me through the roughest of days.
This one ofnmy favorite animes of all times I&#39;ll blast this 24/7 365
I just started it and I am on ep then togoro uses his full power
Anyone still here?
I remember watching one of the very first episodes of the anime when I was a kid. Back before I knew what anime was
My anime shows were Dragonball z and the next was yuyu Hakusho thank you Funimation for these classics.
This is forever my favorite anime
The only intro and outro that gets burn even in my car.
Man this is so nostalgic i Hope they well return one day
This song was instantly nostalgic.  Such a bop.  And the vocal performance sounds legitimately like it was done in one take.  It&#39;s actually super impressive.
Song words so real
Who still jamming to this in 2023 with me?
😢 the good days
This theme has been popping into my head at random for years and today I finally remembered where it came from
Ngl i kinda prefer this to the original op cuz I feel like a kid again.
This series really has best opening English Theme song ever.
<b>I CAN HAVE THIS ON REPEAT FOR HOURS!</b> ❤
I told my dogs take care of yall selves and waved goodbye as they followed us down the road. Left them at family&#39;s home. They all dead now
I’m thankful to one of my friends for introducing this amazing show to me
This video is old enough to go to high school…
I love reading all of these comments. I feel like I&#39;m in middle school again talking to my classmates, but we&#39;re all grown up. ♡ <br><br>YuYu Hakusho was the first anime (besides Pokémon) I ever saw. I grew up without TV until 7th grade and didn&#39;t know how a TV schedule worked, so I only saw random episodes and never knew what was going on, but I liked it anyway.<br><br>Now, 20 years later, I finally decided to watch the show for real--and I am blown away at how good it is!!! Oh my god!!! 😂😂😂 And I keep crying! I had no idea how much of this show I&#39;ve been carrying deep in my subconscious, especially the theme song, which I don&#39;t even remember remembering, if that makes sense. I can&#39;t BELIEVE I waited 20 years to watch this show! Hahaha. It&#39;s kind of hilarious. But hey, now I can appreciate it even more with nostalgia ripened over 20 years. It feels like the most epic return to my true self since the day I saw it first.
One of the most niche songs of all time. Only yu yu hakusho fans know the depth of the experience of this song and the nostalgia it brings.
This shit made my grown thirty year old black ass shed tears randomly lol
Nigga this shit is one of the GREATEST songs of all time fight me!!
Rip Paco Jax and tiva. My 3 dogs loved this song. Sadly lost them 2022
It’s 2022 and I still come back and listen to this I miss this show. Who else listening in 2022 ?
100% still a fucking BOP!
When you get hit by a car and killed but come back as a spirit detective
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ9lHrRrmG4&amp;t=0m56s"">0:56</a>
man if any anime needs a revive its Yu Yu Hakusho! i mean like a JJBA and hunter x hunter revive! lord knows it needs it.
It’s impossible not to smile
Years later and this still brings to my eyes ...
Stagnation can kiss my white carcasion ass
Pokemon got an English dub opening, Case closed had an opening translated to English, yu yu Hakusho did too, saint seiya got I ran by bowling for soup as an opening.<br><br>90s to early 2000 anime was peak of it&#39;s culture. Amazing memories, when people were fans and not cash grabbing on the hype of anime.
Rewatched this and didn’t realize how banger the song is, always liked it but now that I’m older with kids and married it makes me miss the old days so much Lolol
<b>Grande anime dos anos 90</b>
That bass line slaps
can&#39;t lie this song is still better than most of the garbage that is release nowadays
Ahhh the nostalgia.
Man this bring back the easy day watching toonami midnight run for yu yu dbz tenchi then go to the international channel for my tenchi some lost universe or slayers or maybe some El hazard then switch to the action channel for blue seed and some bubblegum crisis tokyo 2040 ahhh the memories
This just reminds me of my mother we used to watch this in Spanish haha i love her so much 😊❤️
Anyone knows the artist for this version ? A lot of BS copies on Apple Music. I want the original track
hello there
This song got me through some really hard times being homeless and constantly on the move. And also when I was going through ECT treatment, it messes with your memory but me late wife would play it then I would remember who she was. Great tune!
Truly my childhood and all-time favorite anime. Very strong and emotional",PT2M57S

And how many times did he win the World Cup aged horribly
7 golden balls
My favourite singer.❤❤❤🎉🎉😊
4 years later I realise in the start it asked how many world cups and now he won the 2022 World Cup 🥹❤
&quot;And how often did he win the World Cup?&quot;<br>this line hits different after Ramos didn&#39;t get called for Spain
he has 7 golden balls
Best song ever
Bro got hit in the private parts
Do it again but now stats
It&#39;s funny that a 35 year old is dribbling with ease with 20 year olds

sitting at 12am doing homework, with a joint in my hand, tranquility essential oil on my wrists, and embracing the full moon tonight&lt;3 i hope everyone takes some time for themselves bc life can get chaotic and we need to take it easy on ourselves cuz we do just enough. dont beat yourself up. trust your intuition and live each day with an open mind.

DRAGON BALL SUPER THEME SONG ENGLISH VERSION.,,278223,2751,95,2018-04-06T03:14:22Z,"whats the name of the song tho, i cant find it anywhere😭💀
I still don&#39;t fuckn understand
I watch the entire Dragon Ball super show.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Yeah DragonBall z
Good😮
This song is amazing 🤩🤩🤩 learn it in English and Japanese both versions because I have done.....!!!!!!
It&#39;s so nice
Lets go go! Big Panic!<br><br>Me: Big- yeah um…
Hey guys I watched all dragon ball episode in Hindi free and English
OwO
UwU
That is amazing😍😍😍😍😍👍👍😍😍😍😍😍
يا جماعه في كدوشه غنت بالغرفتها وامها تضربها 😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
This intro reminds me of 5th grade waiting every Saturday for an episode can’t wait for the new anime
This is really inspirational...we all think we have limits, and that&#39;s what stops us from chasing our dreams...<br><br>Even thou it&#39;s an anime. We can learn a lot of things from GOKU. He never backs down from challenge, even knowing he&#39;ll lose. He says, &quot;I&#39;ll learn new techniques and next time I&#39;ll use it on them&quot;
The best Japanese song
Dragon ball super goku  beer&#39;s goku black

🎤 Lyrics: FIFTY FIFTY - Cupid (Twin Version)

[Intro: Aran]
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

[Verse 1: Aran, All]
A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 2: Aran]
I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)

Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Break: All]
(Cupid is so dumb)

[Bridge: Aran, Sio]
Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

[Chorus: All, Aran, Sio]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
(Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
(I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb
(A fool for love, a fool for love)

🎤 Lyrics: Libianca - People

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Mhmm, mhmm
From Bamenda, it's Libianca
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me?
Now did you notice me?
[Verse 2]
Nobody will know the paranoia
'Cause I put a smile on my face
A façade you can never face
And if you don't know me well, well, oh
You won't see how buried I am inside my grave
Inside my grave

[Chorus]
'Cause you see people, people, people
Pеople don't really know you
They don't rеally know you
'Cause you see people, people, people
People don't really know you
They don't really know you
They don't really know you

[Refrain]
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now did you notice me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, holy father
Oh, holy father I dey try fo hold my head
I say make you no leave me diko
Oh, holy father
Oh, make you try fo understand
Yahoo girl no dey for here

[Chorus]
'Cause you see people, people, people
People don't really know you (they don't really know you)
They don't really know you
'Cause you see people, people, people
They don't really know you
They don't really know you

[Refrain]
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now did you notice me?

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room
Eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me?
Now did you notice me?
[Outro]
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?

I listen to this while  I play vyce
You guys keep pumping out absolute banger after banger keep it absolutely love it can wait for whats in store for the future your team is amazing
I love that Octavia and vyce are my mains and fave characters and both have my favorite songs so good!!❤
Rock at it&#39;s finest, this is fire!!!
I would <b>LOVE</b> an Easteregg of the vocals having a chance to kick in after right after Vyce / Octavia score a goal during a Set that has their theme playing.<br><br>Everyone would love it! ❤
Just started playing and instantly mained her amazing and i like her design alot
Love how the lyrics of Vyce&#39;s theme reflect her backstory in game! Going to be practicing her more in future games, that&#39;s for sure.
Not only the game is a banger but also the themes? It&#39;s insane how big of success this game is especially considering how simple the concept is. Well done guys!
Man I love this song so much, been listening on repeat since it&#39;s release! I love everything about Vyce, her design, her gameplay, everything!
Omega striker devs trying to not make a banger for 5 minutes( they failed)
It&#39;s f*cking awesome <b>~</b>
Why is every vocalist that I like being pulled into making music for Omega Strikers? Thats unfair for my heart
Oh maaan these are absolutely amazing!! Stop it guys (jk), I already love your game! I didn&#39;t think it as possible to love it even more! You&#39;ve done an amazing job so far and I can&#39;t wait to see what else you got in store for us ♥
I&#39;ve never heard of Nano before but this song is amazing and definitely made me want to check out more of their work! Absolutely amazing song probably my favourite of the entire soundtrack so far (but they all rock)
I like to think this is the song Octavia did hear when she gets to see her play. The fact that she would praise her after it means she gets it in some ways
Cool!
GO TEAM ROCK WOOOO
you don&#39;t know how happy it makes me to get full length songs for striker themes now, i hope it continues for future releases &lt;3
This music is so sick.<br>I have been listening on repeat to boost my gameplay !<br>The team really did an awesome work here , even more so with the lyrics after getting to know the characters lore.<br>I just loved it a lot! Thank you guys
Who is she talking about? Her sister Octavia, are they sisters?
this reminds me a ton of like old school Sonic music and I love it
I need this on Spotify ToT
I cannot get enough of this song, you can just FEEL the hard work and passion behind it, absolutely amazing, gosh i love this game...im already looking forward to whatever comes next.
Sorry if no one feels the same, but doesn’t this feel strait out of guilty gear strive or am I just weird?
I really love that the lore tidbits are short, but extremely sweet, and the music production with the lyrics and such really adds so, so, so much to the game despite the small size.<br><br>So I&#39;ll assume this song is before she and Octavia decides to get into Corestrike? such a lovely duo &lt;3
Man the music in this game absolutely kills it. I love how the MVP character&#39;s theme song plays when the game ends or after a round in competitive, really gets you hype, whetever it&#39;s your character&#39;s theme or a teammate&#39;s !<br>Looking forward to being able to listen to this in game during a match 🔥<br>TEAM VYCE FTW
God I could add every song from this game onto my vibe playlist, it&#39;s all so goooooooood!!!
this song is growing on me everytime it come on my recommended.
ゲーム内でもVocal付きで流れてくれないかなぁ<br>チーム内にオクタビアがいるときだけとか、2セット連続フラグトップとかの特殊演出でもいいから
The team behind these is great! They’ve released 2 entire songs, as well as 2 new characters in less then a month, and actually know how to properly make a community happy! The songs are bangers as well!! This is one of my new favourite games!
Had to animate it and give it a rave setting I wish I could go to<br><br>where are my local demon girl bands at T^T
Hmm so I like rock more than edm, Vyce more than Octavia, and this song more than Thousand Absolutes, wonder what I&#39;m gonna pick in the event
This is beyond a banger, this game deserves all the succes its gained and hoping for a hell of a lot more to come!
How is this so damn good?!
Why does this kinda sound like a song for her sister Octavia? All the parts talking about how she’s “not a shadow of you” and “showing you the story she wants to tell” just kinda screams that to me which works for her style of music huh 🤔
Man, Vyce quickly wormed her way into my heart with her design and gameplay, but her backstory and theme definitely helped even more! The Overdrive Oni deserves a hug!
Team rock  Let&#39;s go

Bayraktar

The occupiers came to us in Ukraine,
With the brand new uniform, military vehicles,
But their inventory melted a bit,
Bayraktar... Bayraktar...
 
Russian tankers hid in the bushes,
To sip the fucking shchi with a bast shoe.
But the broth overheated a little bit in the bushes,
Bayraktar... Bayraktar...
 
Sheep came to us from the east
For the ""establishment of a great country"".
The best shepherd of sheep flocks is
Bayraktar... Bayraktar...
 
Their arguments are all kinds of weapons,
Powerful rockets, machines of iron.
We have a comment on all the arguments
Bayraktar... Bayraktar...
 
They wanted to capture us right away
So we hid a grievance for the orcs.
He makes ghosts out of Russian bandits,
Bayraktar... Bayraktar...
 
Russian police is starting a criminal case,
But still does not find a killer of ruschists¹.
Who is to blame that there is a capercaillie² in our field
Bayraktar... Bayraktar...
 
The Kremlin freak is conducting propaganda,
The people swallow the words (of the propaganda).
Now their tzar knows a new word

Nothing against the morale boost/prpaganda, but Bayraktar is now outdated
BAYRAKTAR İS PERFECT
That was quick catchy song for military, and yep singing in  shower on morning time is kinda slaps on that music
Sláva Ukrajina 🇺🇦❤ from czech republice 🇨🇿❤
Quit sending your untrained , sick and elderly to the front while the bulk of your trained soldiers are held back
Much love from TURKEY
Funny how a warning comes up saying this song is offensive to some. Only to those who support the invasion of Ukraine , to us who are on the right side in this war it doesn&#39;t offend us at all.
🎉🥳🎉
❤
Slava Ukraini and Respect Turkey, from Romania! 🇷🇴 🧡 🇹🇷🇺🇦

Jebac ruskie szmaty!
this is only offensive or inappropriate if you&#39;re a russian sympathizer...says a lot about YouTube&#39;s sensibilities, don&#39;t it?
&quot;content has been identified as offensive or inappropriate to some audiences&quot; to who? the russians?
Thank you guys!
Putin invaded Ukraine to start another war, but when his tanks crossed the border.....BAYRAKTAR! 💩💩💀😂

I was that little girl.
🎉🎉🎉🎉
This song is a gem! It relives the disco music era like the Bee Gees, Cyndi Lauper or  ABBA music&#39;s. The composition is fresh yet has the classic touch. Thanks for making this song Zara and the team❤❤❤
Shorty ❤
A real Diva of Pop.
あたしはこの洋楽は好きよ。
Wow, I heard this song on the radio for the first time on my drive home tonight. I hadn’t heard about Zara until half an hour ago. I just found the song and cried my eyes out in my kitchen listening to this. What a masterpiece, I appreciate this artist for stirring these emotions in me, a true talent. 👏🏻
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ALPdRtEthw&amp;t=1m46s"">1:46</a> CART NARC EMERGENCY! Call agent Sebastian immediately 🦺🦺🦺We have a stolen cart. I repeat.. STOLEN CART!
SO GREAT
Zara Larsson ist so amazing i see her in september 😊😊❤
❤❤
Me encantaaaa Zara, la amo ❤️
Some people never get recognized for their genius or abilities until they are dead, SO take the fact that she is putting herself out there and making it happen as a sign SHE IS getting the recognition.  Take it from a creative, we need no one&#39;s validation but our own!!!<br>Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are bought!!!  So she&#39;s doing well without that fake fame.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ALPdRtEthw&amp;t=0m49s"">0:49</a> I love this song she has a gret voice 😀👍👍👍
I love this so much❤
😯👋te miras tan hermosa sepure estoll para ti sepure lo estar aun que trdeses cosas difíciles en la vida llo sepure te animaré asilr a delte tu erse una mujer tan hermosa mull ferte la vida así que si pedes con todos las cosas que quieres yo estoy sepure con tigo

hi. how are you? <br><br>I&#39;m feeling nothing. I&#39;m your friend.
Yessss Zara❤❤❤❤
Zara is a truly amazing artist. This song touched on a emotional level and yet was a bop. Love you girl!!!
Sounds better than Taylor Swift if you ask me.
merecia hitar muitoooo
My home life was more or less pretty messed up. This is how I spent coping, early 90&#39;s was listening to music and dancing. This video captures sooo well
This reminds me hard on a 90´s Melody
This is good toasts!
im just so mad at her label at this moment, done with the fact that she never gets the recognition she deserves<br>DO SOMETHING GIRL, GO SIGN WITH ANOTHER ONE MAYBE?
TRASH but those hackrd pictures online fire ! Douce douce in the backdoor ❤
Absolutely love this ❤ Can&#39;t Stop  Listening Tho Amazing. THANKS ❤
Omg i&#39;m so sorry but you flop
she has a 6 million followers on youtube alone and this video has 1.6 million views . Did any massacre happen that we are not aware of ? This song is so good ,why are stupid songs dominate the charts ?
Is dat her real daughter
Love  form india  💘
cool
I love this! A love letter to yourself. I feel it in your voice! So powerfull, i love ittttttttt, i love me!!!
Very inspiring song. LOVE it.
She is trying to go for the 80s sound which does not work with her Rihanna voice
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ALPdRtEthw&amp;t=1m23s"">1:23</a> 🆙Thank you🙏
This song is very helpful to me right now. Thank you for this music video too. It&#39;s beautiful.",PT3M40S
