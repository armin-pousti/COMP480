Thank you so much, I was searching for a video about him to find out the allegations made against other people… they were so much worse than I thought they would be!!
I’m sorry but once it happens more than twice I stop calling it a scam. Y’all are willing participants at that point
I just found out about this man today, barely 10 minutes ago 😂 he sounds horrible, I’m so glad I didn’t know about him and I didn’t watch any of his videos when he was sort of popular
The first second i saw the guy on the internet and heard his voice i just had an immediate desire urge and desire to beat his ass.
Keem is the side character in every single controversy 😭
Ironic. You ignore the warning signs of a potential suicide in an old fan of your show during an interview, and even goad it on. Then, you commit social suicide by scamming thousands of your own viewers/fans. Good job man. You got what you deserve. R.I.P. ETIKA.
damm keem was/is very mean huh
So uh this video is how I found out Bashurverse had actually died
He’s also a r@pe apologist 😟
can you please do a video on how Elon Musk is the biggest scammer of the 21 century? Please, please, please!!! There is more than enough evidence on the internet to open anyone&#39;s eyes You have to!
I&#39;m actually a believer in blockchain tech, but what the crypto space has become in 2023 is an absolute joke. Anyone attached to promoting it should be lambasted endlessly on youtube videos.
this is well edited thanks man. keem means well entertainment wise but all of them do crypto scams tbh
Dude made a career feeding off of drama, which is totally fine. But the guy got so big headed thinking he&#39;s him, this hot shit, and I just remember he couldn&#39;t go 10 mins without mentioning he&#39;s got &#39;&#39;connection&quot; in LA lol.
Keem need to get fucked up that why he act like that people let him do all this  nd talk like that
I honestly never heard of him.
You&#39;ll be the third bigger channel on youtube exposing scams soon
I wonder how it feels being a boomer knowing death is creeping closer and closer to his door each year and everyone is gonna drag your name thru the mud forever and shit on your ashes bc you don’t deserve a grave
I’d curb stomp keem till he has to eat mashed potatoes just on what he said about cancer
Song at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSe5f72AFgc&amp;t=2m02s"">2:02</a>?
This dude looks like a t-bag
I never even heard of this dudr
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSe5f72AFgc&amp;t=16m12s"">16:12</a> As an actual sociopath, it really ticks me off how often neurotypicals apply that label to literally everybody that they dislike, acting as if neurotypical people can do no wrong while ignoring the true banality of evil. Keemstar is just a gnome, no need to do us sociopaths dirty like that by adding him to our ranks. We get more than enough dirt as is.
Deadass this niggas asf😂😂
all the scammers are moving to snap because of better monetization
All the sad losers that were never popular in school are now popular on youtube. proof that it&#39;s  not right to give everyone a platform
Dude just MINIGUNNED keemstar
Are people actually fans of keem? He’s literally always been a piece of crap. Total human garbage with the sense of humor of a sociopathic child.
Look at you soar! I remember when kavos shouted out your channel and you had around 10k subs! Look at this video! Nearing 500k views! You’re killing it!! All the congrats too you!
If anything he’s only gotten bigger because of the boxing promotion
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSe5f72AFgc&amp;t=27m48s"">27:48</a> Have you seen comments from Andrew Tate fans?
As someone who actually has had to fight cancer - I don’t know why people like Keem think it’s funny to joke about it. It’s extremely scary and financially ruinous. Keem may not ever have to deal with cancer but he will likely have to deal with health issues at some point and he will feel like the hypocrite that he is.
Keemstar does suck, but so does the adult who took advantage of a 15 yr old. I don&#39;t feel bad dunking on that rapist&#39;s grave alongside a living Keemstar. The dead don&#39;t deserve to rest in piece when they r@p3 children. F**k Bashur, dead or alive.
And this is only covering what happened at his peak. Not all the absolutely vile things that happened before his rise.
as someone who just lost their father to cancer, keem is just asking for a lawsuit. I have never been so disgusted by someone in my life.
i thought everyone on the internet knew that keem was a piece of shit already
If karma is a real thing Keem dies of cancer
Keem was clearly a loser growing up with little too no friends. That guy who didn’t get invited to house parties. The guy that brings all the liquor to the party in an effort to people like him. The guy who got cheated on by every girl he ever had a relationship with. The guy who begged his parents to get him a cool car hoping ppl would acknowledge him. I could go on and on…. Just an unhappy loser whose life revolves around talking down on others. So yea, big accomplishment bud. Bravo. Quite a legacy you’ve created. 😅
Dude’s gonna have his day. Let ‘em feel like he’s invincible, so it instantly destroys him went it happens. Total trash.
Hey everyone, hope u are doing well but as humans we are all gonna die one die so I just wanna say For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.... :-].. 777..
The one that makes videos poking fun of other people&#39;s mistakes n flaws will always come back at you.

I really think this video needs spread more, it’s very sad and surprising he’s stayed on YouTube for as long as he has, i hate cancel culture , but keem is truly the one personality on the internet that deserves complete an utter failure. please get this guy off youtube
One step closer to the throne, King of Nothing! The saints of Asonia said that one 😢😅.

I&#39;m concerned for his daughter.
I realized a long time ago that he’s a reprehensible person. But I still think he’s fucking hilarious
I just found your channel and it&#39;s so refreshing
Did he donate or not would be easy to prove
Honestly my take away form this video is that karma is gonna run a cancer train on keemstar from his colon to his glutenous mouth",PT46M,-0.9989

Always found it so funny that Seth acts like a bigshot when he looks and sounds like a school shooter
Loser hahaha
I love how Seth admitted to the allegations then was trying to say he was defending himself against the allegations 😂
Why did Clyde take his video down about Seth?
Seth The Pro Groomer
clyde really should have stayed.
This is Maddening Keem an Pack God should have watched Clydes Video&#39;s Long Before Doing this Stream when someone has such a large platform they can completely Ruin your life an you can easily end up the target of an influencer like Seththeprogrammer and his Boundless Egotistical Ranting This is why people cant come Forward You dont just instantly know somebody is terrible I feel terrible for the Young Girl and Clyde The fact he has people even defending him Shows his Influence he admitted it case closed Kunai in the Rennigan EnumaElish in Seth&#39;s @ss😢
noodles is a fucking leech. But when a certified leech says he literally cant suck your blood anymore, you&#39;re probably a scumbag.

I will say one thing. Seth is a good talker even though he’s a piece of shit.
These comments are very disappointing. A lot of you guys are sounding like Pacgod saying “why did they stay tho?” Or “they’re grown men so no one forced them to stay” is literally ignorant clown shit. Just because you’re an adult or a man, does not inherently mean that you are invulnerable to everything. Thats fucking stupid and such a naive mindset as well as dismissive to the victim. Also if it were as easy as simply leaving, they would’ve done just that. There are often times physical, emotional, financial, psychological (etc.) reasons that are major factors as to why a victim feels they cannot leave. Literal points explaining why in the video that people seem to ignore. If you are one of these people leaving these nasty ass brain dead comments, it truly speaks to the level of how little you know. I highly encourage you to educate yourselves on the topic of abuse, abusive relationships and the interactions that occur within said relationships. Fucking morons
completely independent from this topic here: please watch the twomad video about keemstar lmao why has this guy still a platform
Uh.. No idea why Keemstar&#39;s cringe teenage girlfriend had a place in this whole scenario... But she honestly displayed some of the strangest, most immature and condescending behavior I&#39;ve ever seen - in front of people trying to solve an issue that&#39;s truly troubling amongst their communities. 90% the time - she was just making gestures and facial expressions that you&#39;d find on a child mimicking their parent. What was she too high to appear professional and give people the respect they deserve? Super cringe and immature. As for the situation being spoken about here, I don&#39;t know any of these dudes to be honest or watch much of any of their content. It caught my attention for multiple reasons. All I have to say is I can recognize right from wrong - and this person Seth set off so many red flags I couldn&#39;t count them if I tried. Tbh, real degen hiding behind &quot;mental illness&quot; as a scapegoat and a chronic liar that backpedals consistently. Kind of makes it even worse in that sense. And yes, I&#39;ve seen all the videos circulating on this topic. In any case, my heart goes out to the people he hurt. You deserve the harshest form of Karma, Seth. I hope you get yours.
Looking back at this little situation I remember that Seth was losing his cool and that as time went on and the more the evidence was being stacked against him, I seen a dono saying “it’s over, light” and I just remember thinking the same thing. Seth thought he had it in the bag thinking that this would be his end all be all and then eventually, he started to slip and the more he did, he got to a point that the people who had the most faith in him, see him for as he is. And now, he is forced to see everything that he built fall. It just all the more shows that some people are just malevolent and will use and manipulate people, events, and the periods of time to hide their own evil agendas, and actions that they made. And that they will drown the people who have the most faith in them, to save themselves. Just like light yagami.
Keem is a joke bruh
love this vid keem, but if u could become more of a middleman in these type of convos, being able to quiet convos more easier, i would really appreciate it<br>🫡🫡

keemstar on zaza
Did he make someone eat sht tho?
Packgod is so annoying in this show. Honestly packgod is a random who doesn&#39;t care about the situation. He is just there for the needless drama for the fun of it.
&quot;West coast&quot; only state there is 16.<br>&quot;Wisconsin&quot; not west coast at all<br>&quot;Oregon&quot; oregon is 18 right
Ironic. This guy is criticizing seth for talking to a legal 16yr who was 4 years younger than him at the time (seth was 20) meanwhile he&#39;s dating a girl that&#39;s 20+ years younger than him and is about 7 years older than his 13yr daughter....
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYBjvSIOTak&amp;t=2h06m08s"">2:06:08</a> you&#39;re so stupid Keem, you saying that shows your double standards just because you&#39;re being manipulated to feel bad for him. What happened to showing both sides of the argument before agreeing? Why wasn&#39;t Pac playing devil&#39;s advocate since he oh so LOVES playing it so much?<br><br>Clyde literally tried explaining himself in the beginning but both you and Pac kept interrupting with &quot;Ummmm, what do you mean by that? And I don&#39;t need the full backstory for anything ☝️🤓&quot; but no, when it comes to Seth you didn&#39;t interrupt and didn&#39;t say jackshit to be the devil&#39;s advocate for Clyde 🗿<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYBjvSIOTak&amp;t=2h30m35s"">2:30:35</a> Pac also piss me off, he gotta stfu CLEARLY doesn&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like to be verbally, mentally, and emotionally abused and being taken advantage of with nowhere else to go and being threatened at every moment with the smallest mistakes and calling out the abuser means that you just made yourself a big ass target, why is that so fucken hard to understand Keem? That&#39;s not a &quot;good point&quot; it&#39;s literal common sense 🤦🏻‍♀️
if you don’t wanna watch all of it, the main idea is that seth admitted he’s a fucking jerk to everyone including his very best friends and also sexually harassing a minor.
This is like the final case of an Ace Attorney game. Seth breakdown when?
Fucking keemstar walks away from his desk and grabsa a bottle of fucking whiskey because he knew. there were four more hours of this shit.
I think the host should be able mute other the people to prevent screaming matches.
It’s funny to see keem rip in noodles and his girlfriend cheating on him but as soon as tears are shed it’s “Seth how could you??”💀💀
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYBjvSIOTak&amp;t=4h33m16s"">4:33:16</a>
This is the funniest fucking dumpset fire in the history of YouTube 😂
Jade sounds like a baby Seth lmao
All this besides the pedo shit, could be settled with a fist fight... Have seth get his ass beat and have a near death experience... Or just take 10 grams of mushrooms... Either or.... Lmao
Bro, how disrespectful is Keem&#39;s gf to the situation man. She gets in with a &quot;babe shirt&quot;, with the Satire sh*t being talked about. Then she changes and continues to make everyone cringe for no reason
The whole 2 hours and 20 minutes Seth was manipulating everything man lmao. And then he the doc came in and everything just fall apart

Anybody going to talk about how he broke a diamond ore with a stone pick?
He should have a platform after all he did
I think Keemstar has always loved the attention. It&#39;s an addiction to him. I think he is probably a great guy, but his addiction defines him.
Shout out to keam
keemstar kept it classy
I remember the Tony thing, huge L. It was everywhere when it happened. I felt bad for the guy
I have one of his Xbox’s 💀
These people are so stupid bro I&#39;m 14 and more responsible just by learning what i dont want to be ( a clown for people to laugh at ) and i want to be liked unlike these types of people.
“I’m gonna give it to you, like I gave it to your mom last night.”  I don’t care what else is said, I love this guy😂
90% of people suppose to know this guy?😂 Never heard of him. Like 90% of people which this guy covers are some unknows.

i&#39; m so sorry for whoever edited this, just staring at keemstars big dumb face for hours
<i>Keemstar</i> deserves every bad thing that happens to him, and some. <br>What a truly terrible person.
That RuneScape background music at the start, the only reason I know of keemstar is because the what he did to the old RS streamer, absolute pos
First of all don’t ever say this dudes from upstate New York, Buffalo is western NY -from a real upstate New Yorker
the runescape music gets me every time lmao
Damn, cute music choices. Cute words of appreciation. SunnV2 clearly exposing his love for keem. Bro&#39;s video is 0/10
I still dont like him 👁👄👁
Runescape music
&quot;Alex is a stupid ni&quot;<br>Ah yes call of duty player fr
I appreciate use old school RuneScape music tracks
Turns out “ this little h3 drama” ended this man’s career
sunny hates ninja but loves keem im starting to think you are bias... ppl are doing videos on you i guess they are right
Fuck I’m old 😭😭 and I’m only 21
The start sounds fkn stupid
I don&#39;t give a crap about &quot;Keemstar&quot; and his ARROGANT, OBNOXIOUS ways. Hell, I have much more respect for LeafyIsHere, and Keemstar DESTROYED him!
Like if I got you<br>Did I get y… read more
The &quot;N-Word&quot; being said  is very tasteless and disgusting to say ... Clearly his mom and dad didn&#39;t raise him right.. making his parents look horribly bad .. that shouldn&#39;t be said so willy nilly..
I honestly liked watching drama alert 😂.  He always had all the drama news!
So i hate Keemstar but i dont see how its not ok for Keemstar to say stereotypes to an African American man but its ok for said African American man to say stereotypes to him
i used to hate keemstar so much when i liked H3, but after the devolution of ethan, it’s hard to see keemstar as the only villain.
are you using music from runescape as background noise lol
Keemstar is an interesting man you either love him or u hate him
Keemstar may be toxic, but man it’s inspirational how much of a dedicated entreprenuer the guy is. After all hate and backlash he still comes on top. (I disliked him for many years and now I’m neutral)
What about the Etika situation
i got 90% of my insults from toxic halo 3 players.
What happened to KeemStar he doesn&#39;t upload videos anymore
Unfortunately Tony (rsgloryandgold) passed away last october i believe his wife and i presume son are scheduled to stream on the twitch channel tomorrow if someone wants to send condolences
Bro forgot keemstars biggest part of the story etikas death
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdtpejdmoYM&amp;t=0m09s"">0:09</a> THATS CRAZY
dont forget about etika...
I don&#39;t know who basher is but I read a bit about him. Honestly don&#39;t think he deserved what he got (at least from what I read). Also read he died of covid?

#keemstar #adinross",9932,68,32,2023-02-12T22:12:33Z,"read up on body language tells of someone who is lying. there are several of them in sequence here. or is keem pretending to look like he&#39;s lying to mess with us as well
He is lying and its obvious
I think it’s the fact that he’s just so negative, but at the same time he ran a news channel so it’s hard not to do that. I watched that video a few times and personally I think Keem reflected on that a lot and changed his demeanor bc trashing ppl publicly online will eventually lead to a lot of karma.
Im surprised this washed up Middle aged dude got a fanbase in the first place, grown ass man beefing with teens and ppl in their 20s 💀💀
It’s like that episode of SpongeBob where Mr.Krabs was going through his midlife crisis and he was hanging out with SpongeBob and Patrick in an attempt to feel young again.<br><br>Middle aged Keemstar tried hanging out with Adin Ross and his college aged friends in order to try an feel young again. <br><br>And it failed miserably, just like Mr.Krabs failed when he got caught by his mother, stealing her underpants
He definitely was just drunk not on purpose lol
I hope when keens daughter is old enough she gets ran through by all of YouTube. He’s a pos and his daughter is a trash bag
Lmaooo he did not do that on purpose, he just did not fit with way younger ppl
He didn’t do shit on purpose. Dude is a old ass try hard.
My boy be inhaling that copium hard

The guy that cheated on his girl is “as loyal as they come”. God I hate influencers 😂😂😂
Get def noodles on too while you&#39;re at it lol
Have keemstar on. Hash out the beef (whatever that saying goes)
Yoooo should pay back all the people you scammed Logan all time L Paul
banks is really good at deflecting
How long ago was this?
Keemstar is a piece of shit but respect Banks for being a homie no matter what.
Stop watching this … your being brain washed and unfortunately you don’t understand it yet
It&#39;s no wonder banks likes keem, they&#39;re both fake scamming pieces of shit. How anyone can like banks is hilarious
Logan is looking more and more stupid lately.
Logan sucks. Who agrees
I love Banks and Keem. Keem is a shit head sometimes dont get me wrong, but he has his boys backs. And thats what makes me like him. And Banks just been there for a ton of people too
Banks does not look healthy, he is on drugs for sure :( Hope he recovers soon
Logan is a sociopath.
Get Keem on the Podcast. And call him out for the stories he got wrong because you never say exactly what he got wrong.
Logan just mad that Keemstar was talking badly about him in the pass. Like the whole dead body thing.
I love that.. and i love that…. I just love that i love it i love it i love that
If anyone&#39;s wondering what he&#39;s saying about the team name it was Federation of Asshole Gamers<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDEjhGFjJU&amp;t=5m20s"">5:20</a>
Logan does exactly what he claims kemssar does
Banks is a super successful guy, but that was so dumb. “Personal responsibility” for people being lied to and not for the person lying? Ok cool.
Apparently loyal but he cheated on Alissa 💀💀
W for banks being loyal
Why do banks and Mike have the same voice actor 😂
The issue is yes the parents should be more aware of what their kids are doing but also adult ass content creators, etc should be more conscientious on what they put out especially when they know they’re audience is young. It comes off extremely exploitive when intentionally puts out awful content and bad takes. That’s the issue with Keem, a majority of his content are literally awful takes with false pretense.
I will say he helped adin, but saying Nelk is bullshit lol, Nelk already had millions before he showed up in a video.
What actual talent does this banks dude have
In keem we trust
I hate content creators like banks, he really articulated using up and coming  creators for their clout very well. Also being loyal to a complete piece of dog shit is not something to brag about lol.
Why is George even on the show?
Logan can’t name one thing keem lied about he just says his statements aren’t true
Coming from Logan who thinks there are no biological differences between men and woman
Keem is a nice guy and he’s always straight lol doesn’t beat around the bush like you pr ran fucks
Banks is talking about keems old &quot;org&quot; called the federation of asshole gamers. The acronym is what could cancel them lol
I like keem
he still dresses the exact same from 2017
Yo why does prime taste like a more sugared up Gatorade tho
George looking like he needs a safe space after Bobby Lee
Keemstar is a clown by I fully understand why Banks is loyal to him. When people have been there for u in ur darkest moments, it doesn’t rlly matter what they do after that, I’d always be loyal
Banks owned their asses with just being mature. And not hating on others
that thing about the parents was kinda stupid cuz obviously the parents arent gonna be able to sit there and moniter everything they watch to tell them right n wrong its just unrealistic
Logan can’t criticise Keem when Logan chats so much bs
So much irony from Logan it’s amazing 😂😂😂😂
This video gonna make keem nut
banks look like needs to get off wtf he been on for the past couple years holy shit he looks like shit
Lol Keemstar&#39;s old clan was F@G clan
He talked about Tate so the thing I dont get is Keemstar star isn&#39;t cancelled but Tate is and Keemstar star is way worse then Andrew Tate so why is Keemstar  not cancelled he&#39;s said some racist shot he said the n word he&#39;s lied and he pushed someone to suicide but he&#39;s not cancelled but yet Andrew Tate is thts bullshit so UK the only cancelled Tate is cause the Illuminati and the head of YouTube Susan didn&#39;t like wat Andrew Tate was saying it&#39;s supposed to be freedom of speech but it&#39;s not it&#39;s all bullshit it&#39;s just a lie like Andrew says I don&#39;t agree with alot of wat he says but some make sences the man should be back on YouTube also they have terrorist videos on here like come on
George if you want to be involved but not always with some deep question just ask a general question that has to do they are talking about ..
Banks really tarnished his career and it&#39;s what he deserves
Banks hasn&#39;t put anybody on like that whole teaching them bro this foo banks needs a teacher himself. Banks has always been money hungry, he ain&#39;t even real himself hes just a fraud.",PT6M34S,0.9699

I had to mute the audio because I was cringing so hard
is he on the spectrum or is he really that blind that thinks he handles himself well

Hard to watch but also not haha.

How does that walking embarrassment have an audience. Everything about him is just the worst
nah this gnome laughing killed me irl
I’ll just use this video as a remedy when I’m feeling like I’m having a bad day.

I more i see this 😂😂 he’s not cringe bro he’s just calling out these scammers who claim to have it all 😂😂
I guess having “natural energy” translates to being a good boxer these days 😂🤡
Yeah keep is such a terrible guy. Does a terrible person buy their Ex wife &amp; daughter their own house? And it’s not like a court made him do it he did it out of the goodness of his heart. I mean Adin should have gotten in more trouble for the crypto scams he pulled.
Feel bad for em lol doesn’t fit in with the younger crowd cuz he’s too old but and probably doesn’t fit in with the older crowd cuz he too immature
It is just... so painful
This is so painful
This is either midlife crisis or genius level trolling

He act just like my middle school math teacher when she talking about sumthin trying to be funny no one be paying attention to her she trys hard to act black
Who’s the girl next to Tory lanez??
I know this is a small thing and it’s probably not a big deal but when Keemstar introduced his girlfriend, he not only pointed in the opposite direction from where she was standing, but he didn’t even look her in the eye 😂. Idk it kind of hurt a little watching that.",PT4M14S,-0.9937

This isn’t insane, Malta literally lowered the age of consent (along with the voting age) from 18 to 16 5 years ago. Mr. Piker seems awfully conservative on this issue.
Surprisingly, America the country with the most deviant sexual norms in human history. Also the country with the 2nd (only to Ukraine, who is being invaded by Russia ATM) highest rate of depression in the world and the highest rates of unwanted pregnancy and STDs in the Western world has one of the highest rates of consent at 16-18.<br><br>While Mexico has an AoC of 12 or most of Europe is 14 without causing serious social problems.  Why are they more free than the citizens of the country that calls itself “the land of the free?”<br><br><br>No one can help who they feel attracted to; that spark, that butterflies-in-your-tummy feeling, who they feel happiest around. <br>Raising AoC limits freedom and actually worsens social issues.<br><br>I&#39;m not a fan of demonizing people because of arbitrary social norms. Like I said, the AoC in Mexico is 12, but since they are younger and have less experience, if they want to be with someone 18+, they can bring charges on the older party if they feel used/taken advantage of. They understand that willing relationships are not harmful and people deserve freedom in their personal lives.<br><br>I think the best AoC worldwide is 12-14.
Remember when keem blew up over callmecarson being 19 with a 17 year old when keems literally 41 with a 21 year old
I&#39;m really not fond at all of the idea of a 40 year old dating a 16 year old, but this sick cultish worship of 18 as a magical number needs to stop.  With the way society is headed you will be able to run for President at 18 but won&#39;t be able to stay home without a baby sitter at 17.   <br><br>You don&#39;t go from a toddler to Confucius overnight on your 18th birthday.  It should be self-evidently insane you can go to war, take out a $200,000 loan, and vote for the leader of the free world at 18, but can&#39;t screw a day before that without being considered an abuse victim.  16 or 17 are reasonable ages of consent. I&#39;d say 17 with an extremely light punishment for 16 and perhaps extremely generous close in age exceptions is perfect.
The progressive countries you idolize have the following ages of consent:<br>Canada: 16<br>Germany: 16<br>Sweden: 15<br>Norway: 16<br>Denmark: 15<br><br>And no, don&#39;t tell me those are for people close in age.  When it comes to &quot;close in age&quot; exceptions, those numbers go even lower.
Great age rule for dating, regardless of this stuff: you can date anyone that is half your age plus seven years. To avoid easy confusion I mean this age/2 +7. If you are 25 for example, you can go as low as 19 and a half
Just face it bro.. ever since fresh&amp;fit and Andrew Tate,  pedophilia has blown through the roof. They literally market the idea of preying after baiting young girls with money like kids to candy and now most red pillars I see are basically 80% proud pedo
“The age of consent is 16 in a lot of states” DOG BC WE HAVE PEDOS IN OFFICE
I mean, in Denmark our age of consent is 15. Do with that what you want.
How have youths been rejecting old creeps this whole time? Have those methods been ineffective?
Keemstar never has anything good to say
I mean, I prefer using the right terminology because using &quot;paedophilia&quot; to describe all molestation of minors kinda dilutes it. It puts someone getting with a 16 or 17 year old (still ick, and I&#39;m in no way defending that) on the same level as someone molesting a 5 year old or younger. Both require a sick individual to do, but there&#39;s a whole extra level of fucked up for true paedophilia.<br>I dunno, just seems like the different degrees of severity for murder. Still murder, but not all is on the same level as premeditated serial murder.
hasan is aight but holy fuck i wish he would listen to more of the broadcast rather than fucking 8 seconds of it 😭<br>pretty sure that stream with seth was like ~7 hours and he doesnt even address anything that they actually brought up besides what he heard in the clips😭<br>definitely not defending what they say in the clips but he could learn more by actually listening to their reasoning rather than just hearing a line out of context then just screaming that these people need to get obliterated from the face of the earth, try not to be shallow challenge (hard)
Kreepstar
The guy talking about doing terrible things to a 4 year old has done some terrible shit. He is a debate anime power scaling guy. He deserves to be cancelled. Low key wish hasan covered it like moist
He is so cringe dude
Hasan is 100% right. If Jeffery Epstein was active on social media people would be defending him. They’d be idolising him if he was a right wing shitposter.
When someone is already able to list ages of consent in different locations off hand. 🚩 🚩 🚩
Keemstar is definitely competing with Matt Walsh on who is more creepier.
This is my rule, &quot;Self awarament is crucial, especially born before 2001.
this will always be so insane to me bc as someone who is 23 i don&#39;t even wanna hang out with people who are 18 bc that&#39;s a child to me like wtf
The amount of people with no moral compass is disturbing - saying that the absolute limit of the law is a morally desirable or permissable situation is ridiculous in most contexts - if two sixteen year olds have sex, probably nobody is going to be prosecuted, if a 50 year old has sex with an 18 year old, nobody is going to be prosecuted - one is illegal, but I can&#39;t say the legal instance doesn&#39;t turn my stomach - probably try to have sex with people who are similar in age to yourself, because that&#39;s not creepy.
Keemstar must of learned from Justin Roiland 🤣
The fact most research shows that a brain doesn’t fully develop until their 2o’s says something ….
The way I look at it if you can&#39;t bring them to a bar then you shouldn&#39;t go out with them
Countries in Europe have the age of consent at 16, sometimes 14.
Creepstar
in my country the age of consent is 15 and the amount of creepy older dudes (usually early 20s) i&#39;ve seen that say it&#39;s not pedo shit when they wanna get on with 15yo girls is insane bro.. also there&#39;s plenty of young teen girls that think they&#39;re rly mature for their age, basically adults, who see nothing wrong w dating older dudes that are in uni and shit... but they&#39;re literal children and know no better so<br><br>idgaf that it&#39;s legal, i&#39;m 21 and the thought of dating a 15/16yo boy/girl is incomprehensible. cuz they&#39;re CHILDREN in hs.. it&#39;s disgusting and anyone who says otherwise is on some pedo shit fr
Keemstar biggest hypocrite on the planet
My boyfriend is almost a year older than me and 13 inches shorter than me. Who&#39;s abusing who???
I feel like Keemstar definitely did not look good with this specific take, but if you&#39;re refusing to see the full context to understand why it was even brought up is a bit of ignorance on your end as well. At least that&#39;s how I see it? I am open to being wrong on this but that&#39;s how I&#39;m seeing this ATM.
A lot of GenZ age gap takes are really weird. Its like a lot of my peers are infantilised and not raised to become adults before the state recognises them as such. And older generations takes on age gaps are straight up predatory. Whats with you people?
I dont care if teenagers have sex with older people. It’s only an issue to me if they are dating them.
a 19 year old dating someone who&#39;s 16 is pretty cringe... honestly the same for 17/15
More proof that he groomed his current gf.
People that know the age of consent in different countries and use it in their argument need to be looked into.
so bizarre how leftists passionately opine the decoupling of morality and legality but with age of consent morality is defined strictly to the letter of the law. relations with an 18 year old? two consenting adults np. relations with a 17 year 360 day year old, literally grooming and pedophilia. such a bizarre overcorrective attitude that i will never understand.
&quot;why is the age of consent your starting point&quot;.... Well... it&#39;s kinda self explanatory isn&#39;t it?
H3 where you at ?
Seth isn’t 19, he’s at most 25 and atleast 22, bro made Halo power scaling content in 2013, and made his channel in 2009, he would have been 6 years old.
ironic of hasan considering he likes european social democracies where age of consent is young, its a puritanical thingto have age of consent at 18 , leftists have age of consent lower for sexual freedom. But yeah hasan the same guy that went to a brothel where underage 16 yo prositutes where working so this man is hypocrite.
jeff epstein was a pimp. suggesting a modest reform to the age of consent is not in any way comparable to fucking epstein, you moral bullies
I have some pretty hot takes on age of consent but that’s pretty yikes
Keem is painfully unattractive
I like younger men, but no younger than 35
tbh the age of consent should be RAISED if anything. or there should be age gap laws 💀
3 year difference for anyone under 20...age of consent should be 20. 18 year olds are still in high school...why would any actual adult want to  have sex with an 18 year old?
lol I isn&#39;t this his &quot;learning&quot; arc?
At this point, isn’t it obvious he’s doing shit like this to garner traffic to his drama channel? Anything to get the clicks and views with the gnome.",PT6M22S,-0.9896

I listen to these like a podcast. The discord notification sounds was triggering me lol.
can someone tell me what the song in the background of this vid is??

It must be so horribly embarrassing to get a content cop video made about yourself
To be perfectly honest, what Keemstar did to RSGloryAndGold was very much unforgivable, what he wanted to do was to stream Runescape and have a good time, not be subjected to harassment because of false accusations, if there&#39;s one thing that Keemstar did wrong it was the fact that he disrespected his elders.
This attack on people who challenge him sounds familiar to what is going on with my boyfriend—simulation theory, suicidal ideation, bad past that can be used against him, no resources.😢
That was very illuminating.

There&#39;s no way the guy that looked good roasting set the programmer can be bad
Go Bears Jay! Love the hat!
Daniel is basically Trump and Trump Jr. in the YouTube community.
I think the &quot;asshole&quot; is the guy smugly anticipating reporting on a man&#39;s death myself...
youd think keem isnt  racist but, the way he let the n word slip off his tongue that fast with no regrets.
Keemstar is toxic and cringey.
I&#39;ll never understand what people find interesting of Keem or RiceGum or even the Paul brothers they&#39;re unfunny over hyped goofs
Keem was kinda the blame for Etikas death tbh
That clip with the sweet old man was so hard to watch, you can tell he&#39;s trying not to cry on stream. Just absolutely awful
That old man…I’m so sorry for him…
I didn’t know this guy was so worse then peice shi*
that poor old man i&#39;m actually crying
Also the pyrocynical drama was a bad time for keem it really displays his ego and how he doesn&#39;t think before he does and keem seems like a good person and I wish him the best and hopefully it doesn&#39;t get to his head.
Omg 😢😢😢😢😢 I feal so sad for the old guy I played RS for over 20 years nobody deserves this crap I even met people from rs in real life and hade many amazing moments with my friends just because he old and plays a online game doesn’t meen he’s a pedo!!!! My mum worried about meeting these people in real life but by god they are they nicest people I ever met I don’t play rs no more but we still speak. I really hope he’s ok 😭😭😭

keemstar definitely deserves all the hate he can get. I cant believe how he&#39;s gotten away with such horrendous acts
RIP RS GLORY AND GOLD!!
I haven’t watched this dude in so long since the 2016 war on him, good to see years later he still hasn’t changed, garbage human being
Keemstar is like a cockroach.  No matter how hard you try, he seems to be impossible to kill.

I am watching it in December 2022 and I found out that Rs glory grand dad died in October. RIP
Only took me 2-3 videos from him in 2016 to not like him. How anyone could be a loyal fan of him, I don’t know.
Keemstar always gives me toxic vibes anyways
Keem is Twitter incarnate
Yes, but his beard is a fucking triangle
Who actually likes keemstar?
are people still blinded by keem’s popularity these days, just look at this it’s unbelievable 😒
The old guy Tony he mentioned just fucking passed way this year and it sucks that that incident happened because of keem
I feel so bad for the old guy.

Wait so keemstar doesn’t really support trans rights? He’s just trolling? I thought he really meant it when he said I didn’t know trans men get their period call me naïve but I really thought he learned something oh well him saying it is nice no matter the intent I guess 😅😅😅😅😅
Calling people phones and ist&#39;s has made it impossible to actually talk. The quartering isn&#39;t a Trans phobe. Your just a moron. People throw out these words like it&#39;s candy at a parade.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvglBkxu0gk&amp;t=5m21s"">5:21</a> 😂 🤣this guy thinks that only popular bois are allowed to have opinions while the small guys are not allowed?
We still don’t know which trans girl gave the opinion changing head
Chronically online old dudes 🤢
Not trolling as hard as Dylan is...
As a right-leaning person, I formally decline the statement that Mr cuck is part of this right wing community
Trans people cannot have periods unless they are born a woman
Ok ease off on the dicksucking tweets in the beginning.
Keemstar is a legendary heel and troll. I hope he&#39;s actually cool with the transes while also being the same toilet human we all know and love to hate.
L
Still doesn’t change the fact that you cant change gender or sex, just have a mental illness and a ruined body and mind. Normal people for the win
I accept everyone including trans people and have always done so, but y&#39;all just gotta bring your own tampons please the men&#39;s bathrooms are messy enough and you already know some lil mf gonna scatter them all on the ground
ffs keem you made me agree with sneako XD
Where is the meltdown again?
as a trans person. I just met sneako on omegle and he told me to kms. im 16
Keem makes enough money to compromise on image and not care about online haters. He&#39;s doing this so he can DM trans girls and fem boys. Sad part is I&#39;m not joking
Sneako said start a family when keem has a daughter, braindead
Guy is 45 and trolls as if he was 20.
Giving attention to these morons shows this generation has no chance. What a shame.
gay
Thinking Quarterpounder and Sneako are &quot;right wing&quot; is just as lolf@9  :⌃)
I’d sooner believe 9/11 wasn’t an inside job than Keemstar turning woke XD<br><br>Still getting Hogwarts legacy tho.
Literally nobody is melting down over this...
Does anyone actually watch quartering unironically? Like who is religiously tuning in to watch a grown man cry about litterally everything?
Thequartering is the best example of not being loved by your parents can cause mental health problems
screw trans people. i will buy 20 copies.
People like TheQuartering are so stupid, they are &quot;trolls&quot; who are not trolls because they take everything so seriously, They see something that they dont like, get angry, say something stupid and when someone calls them out they answer with the stupid &quot;I&#39;m not mad, you are mad! why are you so mad? I was baiting! You fell for it! lol!&quot;<br>Nah dude you are not fooling anybody, you have skin so thin that anybody can cut it with air.
Twitter is easy just say you support trans rights even when you don&#39;t they eat that shit up
This is what twitter was made for lmao. Quartering gets so mad at things that have nothing to do with him and then insist he’s not a loser for it
Keemstar can fuck off, he killed Etika. No matter what he says he has no respect from me.
keemstar is the anti hero we dont deserve
You are trans? Wow girl, you really need to work on your voice. It‘s not doing it for me, sorry girl. 😢
Nobody can be transphobic they dont exist. 😆
be straight.
B-b-based keemstar?
The fact that supporting trans people can be used to get big amount of people mad is kinda sad
Sneako definitely had meltdown.<br><br><br>But The Quartering just made a little joke, then diverted his attention five other people.
Yeah everyone is making fun of Thequartering, but why is no one talking about those geeks and gamers shits like Ryan Kinel and Nerdrotic
Trans person has been here<br><br>How can you tell?<br><br>Profile picture
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvglBkxu0gk&amp;t=4m40s"">4:40</a> The Quartering calling anyone else cringe is the pot calling the kettle black.
I&#39;m not a big fan of Keemstar, but the fact that he triggered The Quartering and Sneak0 makes my day.
Virtue signaling
Why does the Quartering mald over the smallest things?<br>I don&#39;t really get the transphobic vibe off of Keem. He&#39;s a lot of not so pleasant things but he doesnt strike me as transphobic. Not trans but I have DEFINITELY met out there transphobic folk.
I would be considered a consenting legal gen z in keems books but it&#39;s still hilarious that he&#39;s the same age as my fucking mom lmfao
&quot;the real sad part is that your overjoyed over a man tweeting at another man&quot; so why you getting mad at that man? Why you doing the same thing?<br>Also saying reply tweets are an L, in a reply tweet, bro...
Isn&#39;t having a conversation with keefals HRT provider still kinda bad.
My God keemstar just gotten brainwash by trans activist at this point he has to be trolling LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
I’m not buying hog warts because the game won’t be good your not buying the game because of the creator of Harry Potter being against trans rights either way the game is going to fail",PT10M17S,0.995

I used to dislike Keem but now love him, anyone else? Much respect
Keem looks like a cool guy. DPS is beyond redemption , Boggie and Wings have a chance to climb back and redeem themselves, hope they dont fall again.
I am not a &quot;fan&quot; of Daniel Keem at all, but I never understood the hatred he got. I think most of it legitimately is jealousy. He is a brilliant business man and very intelligent and perceptive person, so much so that he will pretty much always have my respect. I have never watched a single piece of his content on my own but  all the stuff I have seen people criticizing usually comes off as a different emotion disguised as &quot;deserved criticism&quot;. I am proud of him for being able to retire so young and so wealthy it seems he gamed the living shit out of social media.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXtUzhfvS-U&amp;t=38m45s"">38:45</a>
Bring them to Florida baby! I wanna gooooooooooo! 🤩
Why doesn&#39;t this video show up on the channel under Videos? Had to find the link through the clips
Not surprised Keem would defend degenerates like Tate and Crowder.  That being said, I appreciate the strides he’s taken towards pressing the Pigroach.  I’m not naive enough to believe he’s doing it as a public service, but I’ll take it.
I’m a small YouTuber, I’d do an interview if you’d have me
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXtUzhfvS-U&amp;t=26m32s"">26:32</a><br><br>This is not like when the fiance of the guy who started Oculus was beung publicly harassed by some &quot;journalists&quot;, who were taking their anger at the rise of the Orange Man (which is the fault if his enemies anyway), out on someone who didn&#39;t ask for, or deserve, the spotlight.<br><br>Phil volunteered for this shit the day he decided to live on the internet, have tons of shit to hide, and refuse to ever acknowledgement being busted. All he ever had to do was either fly straight, or go away. He chose both, and so gets neither.<br><br>Barbeque the motherfucker. If he hurt his loved ones badly enough for them to WANT this, he fucking deserves it.
WingsofRedemption should box Elpresador next!!<br> These guys have been beefing on the internet for over a decade now! They despise each other.<br><br>That would be an interesting fight I think
Get Aaron and April from Steel Toe Morning Show as guests. They cover latest news and have covered DSP, Keemstar, and ReviewTechUSA in the past.
You don&#39;t need DSP to be in the documentary. Discovery Plus went ahead with a 3 part documentary about Onision without him being involved.
Rich, Wings and Boogie&#39;s show should be called the 1200 poundcast lmfao, I admit I&#39;ll definitely watch it
I&#39;m so glad you followed up with DSP&#39;s content, there is so much amazing content we would have missed if you hadn&#39;t been mediators for the chaos! Big Ups to the whole crew!
I&#39;ve always found keemstar to be a laid back real guy, i may not agree with everything he says/does but he&#39;s still a genuine real guy. I really hope he does the dsp documentary
Keem&#39;s drinking diet coke. He should be sippin&#39; that Trump juice from a tricked out chalice
DSP turning his life around would break the internet. I&#39;m all for it
Guys, I think I&#39;ve figured it out. You interviewed DSP...you need to interview Philip Burnell
He doesn&#39;t give a shit about throwing his wife under the bus to protect his worthless arse so I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s unreasonable to interview family and friends of the self declared &quot;most prolific content creator&quot; in the world.
Great interview Craig. Well at least the first half regarding DSP, Boogie, Wings and future projects from Keem. I had to turn it off when you started in with the political talking point questions.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXtUzhfvS-U&amp;t=52m00s"">52:00</a> lmao rumble is absolute dogshit, literally the top thing on the homepage today was Russell Brands fake news dipshit show
I&#39;ve never gone from loving someone to despising someone as much as Ethan Klein
I will give Phil this, he talks about bills a lot less after the moist critical thing. He still begs though. But as stubborn as he is, he does very slowly make changes. It’s just too late once he finally does it.
Hello Craig, if you&#39;re going to do a detractor convention, then my suggestion would be to call it Snortcon.  Also, see if you can have a photobooth built that is a replica of phil&#39;s stream studio.  It doesnt have to actually work, just the basic look.  Maybe a replica of the couch setup with the foam in the back.
Phil&#39;s current strategy is a Mao style wall of silence where he bans literally any discussion of drama. Keep screaming louder until he has literally no choice but to speak.
I&#39;d watch everyone of Jordan&#39;s fights
can&#39;t you trie to interview some of people who has known Phil irl?
Great interview Craig. A awesome fight would be Wings vs Billy the Fridge from Drunken Peasants
There&#39;s a difference between &quot;playing a character&quot; and being a &quot;pathological liar&quot;. Phil is the latter, he&#39;s not playing a character, he&#39;s exactly who he portrays on his streams. He&#39;s just incapable of being honest with anyone, even himself.
I would love to see someone beat the shit out of ethan kline in the ring
Honestly, Keem is kidding himself if he really thinks any kind of &quot;offering&quot; to DSP will convince him to come out of his shell.<br><br>DSP is the most stubborn person alive. Surely you guys must know this by now, he honestly prefers begging stream in stream out than getting some kind of offer to do something. Even if Keemstar offered him money, like did previously, it&#39;s NOT going to work. You&#39;re just wasting your time if you honestly think DSP will do anything.<br><br>Making the documentary about him is the way to go, it&#39;s the only way you can actually &quot;work&quot; with DSP without working with him. Speak to his friends and family, it&#39;s not like DSP can really do anything considering the fact he has slandered every single person who has ever been in his life (including family). The guy will never come back down to reality.
Ethan Klein: the final boss of lolcows.<br>And his sidekick Hasan
Man, screw doing anything for Phil that will make him money. Keem should just do the documentary. I want to see a deep dive into the taxes and bankruptcy in regards to his excessive &quot;monthly&quot; buisness expenses. Like, bring in an IRS guy and maybe a bankruptcy attorney to disucss the implications of fradulently writing off mobile ganes as a buisness expense even though they were never for the buisness.
Craig start a YouTuber SlamBall league. Love your stuff since back in OG Gametrailer&#39;s days.
I smell bacon frying
Keem on Chris “how dare he put hi heels on a kid.” <br><br>Keem on admitted rapist and human trafficker Andrew Tate “ya he’s gonna do big thing.”
Maybe Keem could convince DSP to a wrestling match with Hogan and his entrance could be him coming down from the rafters.
This is a true example of an interview where nothing was done wrong, everything was done correct.
He doesn&#39;t want the 50k or else his whole illusion of being broke is gone. His personal friends talked about who he is and it&#39;s exactly what we already knew, liar, manipulator and thief. He should not be praised or helped, he should be permanently removed from any streaming platform. He&#39;s lucky he&#39;s not in jail for fraud.
This was a good interview. Props!
DSP just wants that money to pay his bills!  He just wants to chill. He rocks back and forth on the x and y axis please tip him so he can catch up on back taxes!
dsp does not want drama. He wants to make fun positive chill content and hang with you guys! Anyone else will be banned!
I fucking knew that Keem would fight Ethan, let’s do it
&quot;Stop watching keemstar. Stop watching keemstar!! STOP WATCHING KEEMSTAR!!!&quot; -dsp
man i wanna see wings vs ethan ralph, and the fight has to be held in Lisbon portugal, it would be so funny seeing the little ragepig get his shit kicked in portugal for a third time
For a liar like him interviewing his friends or family is the right thing to do because this will tell the truth to the world and expose the fake mask of that hypocrite.
Once again, a great interview, Craig. Keep up the good work, you&#39;re killing it.

The DSP interview was captivating, seriously amazing. This show should expand into other parts of life. Kudos, you’ve gained a subscriber.
He&#39;ll NEVER admit the WWE thing, here&#39;s why:<br><br>He FALSELY OMMITTED THOSE EXPENSES FROM HIS BANKRUPTCY FILINGS....<br><br>This is a federal offense, since it&#39;s basically LYING TO THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY....<br><br>If he EVER admitted to that, one of his many TRACTORS, would go VROOM VROOM!!! To the IRS or whatever with that PROOF of FRAUDULENT BANKRUPTCY.... aaaaand he&#39;d go either to jail OR he&#39;d have to pay back his ENTIRE DEBT the claim erased within a VERY SHORT TIMESPAN.... it would utterly DESTROY HIM.
Holy shit is that stuttering craig?
Your handle is &quot;sidescrollerspodcast.&quot; Why isn&#39;t this on apple podcasts?
Y&#39;all should bring on It&#39;sAGundam HE LOVES talking non stop about DSP!!
truly a keemstar simping moment
Not even exaggerating. The best thing for DSP would to have a co-host or some sort of sidekick for his streams or regular events. It&#39;s the only kind of thing that would help him in the immediate sense beyond deep existential inner work.
Life has taught me 5 things:<br>1. You cannot fight mother nature<br>2. You cannot outrun death<br>3. You cannot build an empire in a day<br>4. You cannot divide infinity by infinity<br>5. You cannot reason with insanity (and Phil Burnell)<br><br>Unless Keem is willing to breach private info without consent, he will NEVER truly get what he wants from DSP.
From Screwattack to DSP living rent free in your mind. Who is the real loser again?
Holy grifter podcast
Imagine if Keem gets a hold of PandaLee...
You don&#39;t want DSP to succeed since he&#39;ll remain an entitled pos.<br><br>Only when he&#39;s at the rock bottom - he&#39;ll have to get a real job and rehabilitate his life, find a woman (or man) he really loves, and actually be happy.
Romance Kat
Wow
I used to be an ardent fan of DSPGaming, really admired Phil&#39;s passion and unique approach to his content. But over time, I couldn&#39;t help but notice a certain dissonance in his words and actions. The most glaring example was his consistent financial struggles, coupled with the seemingly extravagant expenditure on WWE Champions. I know he has claimed that it&#39;s not his account, but honestly, his refusal to take up Greg&#39;s offer to help validate this claim just raises more suspicions.<br><br>To hear him casually state that he spends &#39;under a thousand&#39; dollars on mobile games was nothing short of a slap in the face to those of us who supported him, and those who genuinely worry about his financial situation. Not to mention it&#39;s just not believable. The math doesn&#39;t add up, and it feels like an insult to our collective intelligence.<br><br>The Sidescrollers podcast, for me, was a tipping point. I&#39;ve stuck with Phil through thick and thin because despite everything, I believed he was not a bad person, just a tad misguided. I thought he was naive, living in a bubble, with a skewed perspective of the world. I even empathized with his struggle and respected his grind to earn his keep through daily streaming.<br><br>But when your lifestyle seems unsustainable, when you plead for monetary help while throwing money away on mobile games, it&#39;s not just naive, it&#39;s outright deceptive. It&#39;s this dishonesty that I can&#39;t stand. I wish it were different, but the lack of transparency and consistency has made me, a once loyal fan, a so-called &#39;detractor&#39; in his eyes.<br><br>My criticism is not aimed at tearing Phil down, but rather expressing my disappointment and hope that he would reflect on these matters. But, I know Phil would just look at me another detractor and that&#39;s why he&#39;s gonna be stuck like Keem said at level one.<br><br>So thank you Greg and Adam, for this podcast and for allowing space for these discussions. Yall are awesome.
Have you tried to reach out to John Rambo, Harold, or OJ? IDK if they&#39;d be down, but they know him better than anyone really.
What happend to Seth the Programer?😊
imagine if kat signed into keem interviews
I don&#39;t know why anyone would wish the best for Phil when he is such a terrible person.
You guys are really milking this one dry, huh? :P
I would kill for an opportunity to let someone take control to help me make money. Phil dont want that. hes gotta have control over everything. Sometimes in life you have to surrender control. I can see in the next 10 years he will still be on level 1 ill finally be on level two with my wife watching him as part of our routine. lolz
I really don&#39;t like keemstar but his last couple moves have made me laugh. I would be so thankful to him if he made a DSP expose documentary lol
He is just a weirdo...leave him alone
Phil didn’t even accept his own mother’s help for a honeymoon. What makes us think he’d ever accept help from anybody else besides those who don’t question him?
You guys should have brought up the 9k he claims was stolen from his account... on the show he said they didn&#39;t have access to his account.
Good luck contacting people he knows in real life. The guy is a complete shut-in who is scared of any kind of social interaction.
Years of being totally isolated within his stream chat has ruined him. That interview was probably the first time in years he&#39;s spoken to two other souls
DSP has always been an ungrateful, lying, narcissistic, stupid, and toxic e-begger. That&#39;s why people watch him, because he&#39;s such a dumb shameless POS. He&#39;s literally been making 80k a year to play dope games for a living. All he does is complain about how stupid the games are designed and lie about hardware issues (&quot;it&#39;s the lag!!!&quot;, &quot;I pushed the button!!&quot;). The problem with the games is really Phil&#39;s problem with everything... he puts in zero effort and will blame anything but himself. Why play a tutorial when you can just run through everything, know nothing about game mechanics,, and try to cheese every boss? He literally played dark souls for over an hour complaining &quot;the game didn&#39;t tell him what souls are for&quot; (it&#39;s an unskippable instruction at the beginning). This is a &quot;top creator&quot; that was still pointing a camera at his TV until like 2014. He&#39;s been getting handed bags of money to act like a petulant child, then he immediately lies about the money, and tries to guilt trip/scam his audience. I don&#39;t get all this &quot;we want to help him make more money and have a better career&quot;. He&#39;s put in next to no effort into his content, made 100&#39;s of thousands more than he&#39;s deserved, lied about all of it, and been staggeringly ungrateful. Fuck him.
He doesn&#39;t understand what networking is ,he said he would throw a dr disrespect shirt in the garbage,instead of trying to flip that opportunity
Dude I hate when outsiders come in then try to express empathy, cows dont deserve it.
DSP vs OnlyUseMeBlade
I got mixed feelings. I want the best for everyone. But at the same time, Wings and Boogie hasn&#39;t changed after the boxing match so why would I believe DSP will? If Phil just gonna use the money on gambling and continue to beg his fanbase for money then there&#39;s no point.
Phil has a crew of disabled peiple who give him all their disability checks
Before the interview, I had some hope that DSP would change; however, that ship has long sailed. The aftermath of the interview and his recent antics towards the audience and and detractors have made it clear that he will never change and is willing to double down to &quot;own&quot; the latter. I&#39;m just waiting for karma to come back at him with the receipts on hand.
There no need to look into this, he has a “learning disability”. There mystery solve. Because I have it too, and I see a lot of my self in my younger years in Phil. It took me along time to figure it out, but thank god I’m seeing a doctor for my issues and now I clearly see everything that I was doing and I feel embarrassed.
Keem, one sugestion: don&#39;t try to reach to him. Wait for him to reach you. Sooner or later, he will despair when his dents are gone. He has no shame, he will twist things somehow and actually reach you for help. Because I genuinly believe he would rather commit suicide than get a 9-5 job.
I don’t perceive a DSP documentary involving family and friends as being immoral.  <br><br>His name and face have willingly been made public knowledge for well over a decade. <br><br>He has had ample time and opportunity to ask those close to him to NOT speak to anyone about controversies in which he has been involved.<br><br>He also may have made fraudulent claims in regards to his bankruptcy which should always be something we strive to uncover.<br><br>I think there is an interest in the public good as far as the bankruptcy claims go in our legal system and false claims to his supporters who give him money based on his claims of being poor.
it&#39;s pretty simple if you pay attention. Clear him of debt and pay for his house lol
DSP is a compulsive liar. He probably can&#39;t tell half the time when he does it, because he lies like he needs to breathe. A compulsive liar is desperate for control, and interviews exposes him to a lack of control, which I&#39;m surprised he even thought this was going to go well for him.
serial lip licker
Okay hear me out....what if Keemster IS DSP and he&#39;s just wearing a fake beard and bandana?
I guarantee you Phil will get in the ring for 100k but he’s still too scared he probably thinks the audience will jump into the ring and beat him up because they’re detractors.
DSP is interesting because he is such a terrible person, but he is far too delusional to realize it.<br>He has ZERO reedeming qualities.<br>The only lolcow that you can&#39;t at least partly be rooting for them to be successful &amp; happy
Should have offered Phil a Gold Hogan rather than a Golden Ticket
Fuck augie, as if youtubers are a special kind of people that should be treated differently.
It&#39;s not a character. He is an outlier, an enigma who is enabled and supported by contrarians and wrong reasons. And it&#39;s ONLY him. He isn&#39;t supported because he puts out good content. He is supported literally because the supporters have an agenda to enable him to keep him there - and to keep the &quot;haters&quot; out. Both him and the fans have broken mentalities around control.
I genuinely think if Keem goes ahead fully then it will absolutely destroy DSP, he&#39;s been given soo many chances to change his ways but hasn&#39;t done it.
Oh Phil....
They have been taken by the vortex 😢😂😢<br><br>I think DSP is hiding something (other than bankruptcy fraud) and him getting out of his hugbox will open up the possibility he will reveal things he’s too damn ashamed of",PT10M15S,0.9965

Wow jidion doing the one thing ethan never can, being good faith.
Where the hell is keem i miss drama alert?      Kinda
Hila would treat Brantley 😂
Im sorry but anyone who thinks its funny to go into a college and pull pranks esp wkth all the shootings that keep happening does not deserve a W in front of their name at all.
Jidion was definitely kidding… but I think he does like Ethan…… And honestly, I like Ethan generally speaking, but I really do believe that keemstar would whoop his ass if they got into a physical altercation… I think he has more power than Ethan… they might be the same weight, but Keemstar is more in shape
Keems new 20 year old GF couldn&#39;t even beat up a plate of chicken parm yet she thinks she can take HILA, wow....
The dunce reminds me of someone with a plan until they get punched in the face
I&#39;m glad Keem is embracing his baldness. It definitely looks better than his weird covering.
Fucking heeb
Keem keeps stroking his beard like someone is gonna steal the hair off his face
He called me the N word....he called you a monkey....ok Ethan
Love that Dan although works there, isn&#39;t afraid to say &quot;that&#39;s on you, I got no involvement. We homies&quot;.

Bruh this straight up made me like Jidion and I dislikes him before 😂 FAMILY
Keemstar is not 5 inches shorter than you lmfao
Hey ethan, what word sounds like mouth silk?
I like you Ethan, but Keemstar would win you in boxing no problem. 😬
Jidion absolutely loves H3 💯 you can tell it’s so obvious you can tell he is a real deal OG foot soldier💯‼️🎯🦶🏿 jidion fake laughing at Keemstar’s jokes is another 1 of my favorite parts in that video.
remember when Ethan was cool
Ethan will never lose weight he doesn&#39;t have enough motivation
Bro tell me why H3H3 be twitchy and tweaky 😂

the idea that drama alert is worth anything, much less $20mil, without keem is fucking laughable

he&#39;s such a heel, I love to hate him lol
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL5m0GPTbYc&amp;t=1h11m19s"">1:11:19</a> is the absolute most wholesome moment in this video. This guy right here, has a pure heart of gold. And keemstar is a dick, to this guy like that. Absolutely fucked up.
Idk how keem is allowed on the platform. My favorite gun tuber or comedians get flagged for hate speech every other video. Dude is a total waste of space.
I dont watch his trashy content and from what little I&#39;ve seen of him, I already got the picture that he is a terrible human being.
Ppl kiss this dudes ass? Seriously?<br><br>Ppl are masochistic as fuck.<br><br>And the irony that he says M$ is harassing him when he’s literally harassing and trolling other gamers?<br><br>What the fuck kind of childish bullshit is this? Oh this is the golden age right? Fuck all that shit, lame shit that no hands do cause real life is terrifying.
lol that most played part had me replaying
I&#39;m so used to Keem showing up in every other video that I half expected him to somehow show up as an antagonist to himself in this as well
You can literally buy that foam anywhere. You should have just flew to London and then built the bottles. It would&#39;ve saved tons of money.
Tony Ray passed away in October of 2022. I never watched him but he seemed to have a soul of gold.
Leafy was banned for much less
People like this have destroyed the internet through their own narcissism and lust for influence, and it may be permeant. Fuck them.
I came back to this after DSP tried to use this doc against Keemstar on his interview with Sidescrollers.  Phil&#39;s a fucking hypocrite, but Keem at the very least was professional on that interview during his brief spot.<br><br>Like yeah say what you will about Keem, I personally don&#39;t like his content, but that moment was an eye opening experience.
lmao this video caused DarksydePhil to turn down a $50,000 payday from Keemstar
I really don&#39;t see much of a problem with Keem. His personality is so well documented now that anyone that gets into bed with him should know exactly what to expect. I think history will see Keem as a cross between a modern day Heffner or rather a Larry Flint and Vince Mcmahon. He threw red meat to the masses and they both hate and love him for it. I don&#39;t know if his bad impulses outweigh the good, but he&#39;s certainly entrepreneurial, driven and has integrated his shadow into his personality.
I think if he crafted his image he would have fallen apart long ago, thing is people come for somthing the see when they like it, if it turns out the guy is not like they thought that often leads to a heavy down trend to nothing. Because he is what he is he has gathered a following who expects and wants that, he cant really fail because he mask cant slip off because there is no mask.
The audacity of Keem calling someone a manipulative monster is projection of the highest degree
Him saying fuk the fans I don&#39;t care about fans I&#39;m here 4 money was great bit much the cancer but there&#39;s no honesty on line 2day all the love u guys shit is gay af bring back the wild west online u get cancelled 2day 4 saying a man in a dress isn&#39;t a woman lol no white dudes screaming nigga n making kids cry 😢 I miss it honestly
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL5m0GPTbYc&amp;t=49m25s"">49:25</a> keemstar showing some humanity? Interesting.
Yup. His clash with dsp will reveal what he is. A hero he is not
The tragic part of it all?  Is that Keem represents an awful cycle that is all too common online now<br><br>You have an asshole to his core, who doxes, incites harassment, smears, and so many other revolting actions online.  Rightly this person&#39;s reputation is dogshit and even he isn&#39;t denying it (or if he does, it&#39;s the Trumpian posturing no one takes seriously).  Yet you get people who take shit too far or find every opportunity to push blame in situations like with Etika&#39;s death where despite the family absolving Keemstar, people still continue to parade the short clip of that interview which forces people with some moral compass to defend this douchebag, which is then construed as you being a fan, and so forth.<br><br>I revile him on a moral level.  He is Jerry Springer mixed with TMZ, two of the absolute bottom of the barrel forms of content that appeal to the lowest common denominator.  Unlike Springer and TMZ however, Keem is able to harness his despicable actions, force overzealous people to blow things out of proportion, and then profit off it all.  He&#39;s so ingrained in online culture that it&#39;s virtually impossible for him to go away short of the most extreme fuck up or a manic person taking matters into their own hands
It&#39;s deplorable how a garbage human being like Cumstar can get wealthy being a douchebag.<br><br>If only all these young edgelord dork tweens would stop giving him views
Do you also have a channel called brew ? You sound like him
Drama is for women and g@y guys. Those who accuse other of touching kids are the ones that touch kids
Who&#39;s Keemstar?
Man blade, I forgot about the existence of this idiot too. <br>What a couple.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL5m0GPTbYc&amp;t=24m13s"">24:13</a> wait a tick is that fucking Freddy Wong on the left?
Where&#39;s one done on DSP?????
Seeing how idubbbz held onto his grudge silently for YEARS against Sam Hyde it does not surprise me at all that one message from keem was all it took to start a war with Ian. Man I hope idubbbz is at least loyal to people who treat him good cause this man does NOT fuck around when someone tries him haha. (Ngl kinda have to respect that about him even if I think holding onto grudges for that long is kinda petty)
I think what I have the least respect for in all of this is Keem acting like mental health isn’t a thing. That kind of perspective is so profoundly ignorant and harmful. It’s literally what fucked up all of our previous generations. It’s not something to downplay.
Keemstar actually did something good by getting that swatter to confess. He got an evil criminal arrested, spread the word about donating to pay for the victim&#39;s funeral expenses, yet was humble enough to admit that he didn&#39;t feel like the hero everyone was praising him as, because it didn&#39;t require him to do nearly as much as he thought it would have in the end.<br><br>I&#39;m sure it convinced SOME people that somewhere deep down inside of that ugly and despicable persona of his that he might actually have some semblance of a heart. He could&#39;ve just run with that, and it might&#39;ve been the single greatest redemption in YouTube history, but no, he just had to return to the status quo to keep inflicting misery on others because there&#39;s nothing else he truly enjoys in life besides trolling, and aside from his other trolling friends, he will die alone, especially if they go first.
Are we sure Keemstar is a human being and not a human shaped pile of horse shit that somehow gained sentience?
Is Daniel Knome just completely unaware of the concept of a &quot;MILF&quot;?

Some of the comment here list legitimate reasons to not like Keemstar. Others are just pussies plain and simple. Man up. Grow up. Go outside. Stop being weak
This guy became &quot;woke&quot; for barely-legal p*$$y...
Yikes. ):
People like this make me sick... I had a sister who died of cancer before I was born. This man deserves the death penalty for what he said. The fact that this man is still alive and breathing the same air that I am makes me want to rally with everyone who has had family members who have had a similar experience and beat the shit out of this man. Cancer is something you NEVER joke about! You NEVER insult someone over it for.
I&#39;m honestly shocked by how well keemstar got off early youtube
Great vid! Some notes, mostly for self:<br><br>-Wow! Keem doing collections! Makes perfect sense, he has the personality for it. I would have kept him without a degree, too. <br><br>-The scan things sucks so bad. Imagine being so desperate for money that even someone with a lot of experience fell for it. <br><br>-Although “Fuck the Fans” rant was pretty messed up, I kinda appreciate the bits of honesty? People who are honest about doing things for the money, scam their audience less XD
Wow... I was under the impression he was one of the good guys until I saw this expose.  Goes to show you don&#39;t know a guy just because you watch some of his videos.  Definitely very eye opening.  Good work, Joon!
Man, seeing Etika choked me up a bit ngl

Keemstar has gone after people’s sponsors before so I don’t care that he lost his sponsors
keemstars daughter is my breeder
coming from asmongold&#39;s shiity take video defending KEEM sooooo much
The H3H3 fanbase is so fuckin toxic
He addressed this “going after sponsors” bs
you we&#39;re wrong
Never have liked ethan
Agreed
Sorry but keemstar 100% deserves to be deplatformed
Awful take, it is old beef and old video but somethings didn`t exactly change. Both can be pieces of shit but Keemstar is at the very least a criminal for doxxing or motivating his base to do it for him. I do not like Ethan, but I have zero sympathy for what Keem is going through. Just the doxxing should be enough for him to be ban forever from youtube, while manipulating content creators should be enough for the community to ignore him. Again, I don`t like Ethan at all, but at the end of the day, Ethan didn`t break any laws and proudly admitted.
Is it just me or the thumbnail of this vid looks like Charlie’s face was tweaked with A.I. or something ☠️
ROFL old but I can&#39;t resist.......&quot;what Keemstar could do is&quot; exactly what I&#39;m about to do and ripping on H3H3 for doing throughout this entire video.  The entire premise of this video is to deface H3H3 so don&#39;t be fooled by his regurgitated buzz words like &quot;government censorship&quot; and &quot;cancel culture&quot; to trigger you and actually use your brain. This guy is defending Keemstar because he thinks youtubers are entitled to sponsorship and people shouldn&#39;t do exactly what he&#39;s doing in this video. Confused? Me too but that really is his entire point. He PURPOSEFULLY left out what Keemstar was exposed for and the real reason he lost his sponsorship over so I will tell you. That scumbag was using his channel to create fake messages and expose a streamer ruining their career/life accusing him of being a pedophile. He was called out for being a lying POS and proof of the real message was shown. Did Keemstar stop? No he kept at it trying to deflect blame then tried to get another streamer&#39;s kid exposed accusing him of bestiality for attention. Now what&#39;s this entitled youtuber&#39;s reasoning for stating Keemstar shouldn&#39;t lose his sponsorship? Because the people who make that sponsorship possible exposed him directly to his sponsors and it ruined his career. This is &quot;cancel culture&quot;? No this is how sponsorship works youtube boy step into the real world. He has a problem with people telling the truth and exposing scumbags like Keemstar, but he has absolutely nothing to say about someone who costs someone else their career by lying about him being a pedophile. Just content right? Sponsorship being lost because of bad publicity isn&#39;t censorship or cancel culture its a business decision you fool. Sponsors don&#39;t care about youtuber&#39;s careers nor does anybody else really they only care about viewers and viewers only really care about the type of content created. You obviously do not understand this and actually think that people getting exposed to their sponsors was something that just started happening 2 years ago and its a part of &quot;cancel culture&quot;. You want to know why Keemstar didn&#39;t do this to H3H3? Because he CAN&#39;T. He&#39;s a POS and no one wants to be associated with that scumbag. That&#39;s not cancel culture you that&#39;s just being exposed.
i know this is old. but is was this incident right here which caused me to unfollow h3h3. and years later i almost forget ethane was even a person. Checking on on h3h3 channel, it seems I wasnt the only one. He exposed himself being a shitbag and worse, he didn&#39;t even realize it.
Both are losers
H3 is a wolf in a nakedmolerats clothing
Honestly I think I might be the only person in history who doesn’t know if I hate Ethan or keemstar or like them. They both done shit stuff, but also good. Obviously this is not proportional, one has done more good then the other subjectively. so as in many things in life I’m a fence sitter.
The video you mentioned, by Gokunaru, was &quot;removed for harassment.&quot;<br>H3H3 is genuinely scummy.
I think Ethan is objectively worse than Keemstar, despite what this comment section seems to be saying. Recent stuff has him spreading false allegations, leaking addresses, and making bomb threats.
People are responding by saying &quot;but Keemstar did this&quot;<br>Meanwhile Ethan &quot;accidentally&quot; doxxed the wrong person recently and spread false allegations...
i would love to be a youtuber like Charlie, but he’s a literal wordsmith and is so good at speaking, i have trouble saying a sentence without stuttering
You predicted it man
beware the wrath of the NPCs and simple apes!
This kind of as a whole started cancel culture. People realized that businesses would cave into pressure.
Same
I just thought it was shitty of h3h3 to blame him for someone&#39;s suicide.
This was a terrible take
You Tube is a scary business for many reasons.  Creators put their entire lives and futures into YouTube... and then a &quot;controversy&quot; pops up, and people start digging, and before you know it, views are down, people suddenly hate you and feel personally conned!  How are you going to pay the mortgage, the taxes, the bills now?  One video can destroy a career and reputation. You Tubers are either thrill seekers or unaware that it&#39;s not forever, and it&#39;s basically out of their control. No thanks.
looking back this drama was so lame keemstsr is an asshole but it’s the same grade a undera he did the same but no one cares
TLDR:  &#39;&#39; Please dont do this to my channel &#39;&#39;
I love how nearly every youtuber acts like calling out sponsors for associating with scumbags is the worst thing in the world. LOL.
Going after someones sponsors is legit imo. For a start, its how you go after big companies or people you otherwise cant legally touch, famously the WWE fandom out pressure on snickers when WWE named a tournament after a known Abuser (litterally whoring out other female wrestlers against their will) within the industry and it worked. Keen is a racist, he has committed multiple actual crimes live on stream and routinely either falsely reports things because he doesnt have the will to do real research or maliciously lies about people in ways that will discredit them. I can beleive that 2 years later hes still on this platform.
You really missed the mark/crossed the line with this one
I don’t agree, I usually always agree with Charlie, keen star deserves anything that comes to him in all honesty, let’s drop the rest of his sponsors.
Have no idea who any of those guys are just Charlie
I love the level head you&#39;ve got, and how you can recognize that issues aren&#39;t always black-and-white. It&#39;s something I strive for, and wish other people would too.
I love Charlie but this is a stupid take. Keemstar isn’t employed by G-Fuel. He’s a sponsee. A sponsored spokesman. If his sponsors really stood behind who pitches their product they shouldn’t have any issue with what he says. I think nuance is important and what self respecting company/brand would actually stand behind keem and what he’s done and said. Keem has literally pressured a dude to commit suicide. He shouldn’t have a platform to do that type of sht.
Ethans got nothing on the fucked up shit Keemstars done. Good guy, bad take.
i mean one of the only resons i hate keemstar for calling some poor man a pedo
I’ll be honest, if keemstar made the tony mistake today and got him dropped by all his advertisers I would LOVE to see the fallout of when the cat came out of the bag. Seeing as if the brigading was big enough to allow such a thing to happen the re-brigading in the opposite direction announcing Tony’s innocence could result in some hilarious apology tweets from the advertisers and platforms. Call me devils advocate but the backpedaling would no doubt cause my brain to release dopamine.
Keemstar is having a taste of his own medicine.
The thing with Ethan giving power to his fanbase to ruin someone&#39;s career is the same thing that Keemstar has been doing from the start. There&#39;s lots of messed up things Keemstar has done and it doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;ll ever change his ways.
I know this is all old as Shit but I think the funny part about all of this is the second sponsorships &amp; Money became involved, then every single creator was up in arms. Keemstar deserved all of this &amp; much, much more. If someone is a piece of Human garbage who abuses his platform &amp; uses his mindless fanbase to attack and Bully anyone they deem fit, then that person should lose their platform &amp; sponsorships. It&#39;s a really simple thing. Don&#39;t be a piece of Shit and you won&#39;t have anything to worry about.
Very good opinion.
you sound pretty greedy !!!
he predicted the future!
Sure, going after someones sponsors is a fucked up slimy tactic.<br><br>But this is Keemstar, and he deserved much more slimier things to be done to him.
The minute majority of youtube would be filled with these &quot;call out&quot; channels.soon or later youtube will turn into twitter.
Look at it now, Ethan is being cancelled and his sponsers are kicking him out just like he did to that dumba** Keem.<br>This guy was right at the end
Now, this is something you will never hear again on the internet, but I disagree with some of your opinions but I respect them",PT9M,-0.9995

Hows it feeling that your getting doubled by a &quot;kid&quot; named flamingo 💀
I didn&#39;t know you were legit when you named yourself KILLER keemstar
Keemstar we will never forget what you did
Folding you 2 fold ☠️
Keem was absolutely right about one thing though. ImAlex was (and still is) one of the worst people on the planet!
Oh damn, only 164k in a month? Ypu&#39;ve really fallen off, huh? Damn even H3 is still going on a second channel and is pulling in 5x the views.

Assasin.
Big ups for both of them for actually showing up and boxing. Now if you could get DSP and LowTierGod box each other....that would be a boxing event of the ages
Bro messed up bad,y by calling flamingo a kid who has more subscribers then he ever will dream of having
These videos are bad bro get a job or something useful and helpful
Aye respect to boggie for dping it to revive his career
thery Takin Our guns!!!!!
bro laughed at flamingo even tho he has twice subs as u
i will say, its on boogie for bad investing. Hate to say it but i dont fele much sympathy if u put all your eggs in one basket.. investing has risk and reward, and if somethings going uyp by a thousand percent, itll crash eventually.. so if u get allured by the amount of money, shouldnt have put it all in thier
😂😂😂😂 i just so funny that you thought that flmango a 10 million channel was a kid
we will never forget what you&#39;ve done
You&#39;re a monster for being the reason so many people get bullied.

that chick went to my highschool......
This guy has less views on this video then the guy he is criticizing for having not a lot of used for.  What a joke.  All of these people are cringe AF
Lmao all of these streamers including this guy are cringe.  There is nothing not cringe about streamers or &#39;influencers&#39;
Bro adin ross will always be more successful then you Ethan. Remember that when you fall asleep tonight
Ooooh   how the turns have tabled
both h3 and Keemstar need to grow up badly
whos the cute girl next to tory lanez?
Keemstar dresses like he’s a 16 year old fboy
What is this idiotic podcast
Bro legit talks so slow ffs💀
Omg this is so cringe Keemstar y
YouTube suggested this to me on aug 25th to remind me of the anniversary
When he’s talkin, bein super weird and cringey, and errybody knows it but him… read the room my guy!!! Read the fuckin room!!!
Keemstar’s laugh at the joke he didn’t hear makes me think of that Key and Peele skit where Key’s holding in his embarrassing laugh 😂
10 years later and he is gone
i swear all this guy does is talk shit abt people
This is the first real account of the &quot;you&#39;ve posted cringe, you&#39;re gonna loose subscribers&quot; meme.
i mean ethan has good points but why is he acting like hes high asf
I wanna fight keem out of all the YT community he killed his own career that weird oddly sharp human being and don’t hate on Adin he a good dude who likes his dudes that’s all
Keemstar is sounding like Gabbie Hanna now
The end is near for Ethan
i hate ethan but this is a good video
Doing my self induced lockdowns again dudeee
He&#39;s aged fake beard
Nothing 😎😷
All these old azLe bay alumni get on meeee nerves
Because KEEM STAR is gone ETHAN LET IT GO
Funny because now H3 Podcast highlights never even clock 100k
I used to like the H3 podcast, best episode, Post Malone and Joji, just good vibes, dudes hanging and chilling, now all Ethan is a huge hypocrite n does exactly what Drama alert does
I think he has a aids
Hey, I think he rubbed em the wrong way by not introducing his partner too, that way no one in the room is a ? Breaks the ice, the dude was too wrapped up trying to act hip and cool with the younger gen, sitting there trying so hard to fit in that he fell out the other side, in the end, his partner melded in better than he did, He&#39;s running up and down their house with his clown costume on.<br><br>Send it to Seth, Family guy enjoys roasting celebs and all Haha!<br><br>Edit: Never mind Family guy already did<br><br><a href=""https://youtu.be/RPnDj7t5E5k?t=9"">https://youtu.be/RPnDj7t5E5k?t=9</a>
Awwwwwwww damn I just found out Keemstar has the same birthday as me.. Today was looking positive before this news
Ethan talking about someone being old and cringey is ironic af lmao 🤣 you both horrible and goofy as hell.
At this point you mentioning him keeps him alive, I keep forgetting this fkr exists
Vibe check!
I see this thing where people get big and then get lazy, put out sub par content and get less consistent, then blame yt algo when their channel stagnates.
Just like ppl starting to realize Rogan isn’t that cool anymore
Look at Adin now :(
Lol a boomer calling another boomer a boomer
Tory Lanez didn’t leave because of keen he probably just had to poop or something and used that as his cover. I heard he has IBM
Basically, no one cares about &quot;drama&quot; as much anymore
Keemstar is just like this host lol same person
Trisha lives rent free in Ethans mind
Keem cringe absolutely lethal
As someone who has anxiety and is sensitive to situations like these, I feel like I&#39;m about to pass out when I watch this shit. The cringe is overloading my brain, no cap 🧢
Keemstar reminds me of an extremely insecure highschooler. I don’t know how to describe it with the exact words but it’s his mannerism &amp; his social skills. He’s not confident in what he’s saying. Even the way he introduced his gf was weird. It was like he was shy or embarrassed. When ever I’ve been in any social setting where I’m with my girlfriend, making the introduction is always the first thing that comes from my mouth. I have a feeling he wasn’t very comfortable with himself when he was younger so now that he has some level of fame &amp; success, it’s become his identity &amp; when ever someone threatens that he becomes very hostile &amp; defensive. Even the way he thought he had to justify his drop of views is interesting.
I stopped watching Keem after the Adin Ross video. Also, the NoJumper Wanting To Be A SLut  comment was him trying to be &quot;Cool&quot; and made him look stupid. <br>Bye SkeemSter",PT16M37S,0.9853
Keemstar reacts to the PKA subreddit turning against Kyle,pka,14459,522,236,2023-05-18T04:14:45Z,"Why does keem act like we hate wings? They are realistic about wings. You see them at many moments defending wings even when wings has talked down on them. None of them wish him failure. Taylor is most outspoken and wings has on multiple occasions talked down on him and said he stole his job (he took lefty’s job
All Jared Fogle needs to do is box someone and he&#39;s redeemed
Battle is the Great Redeemer. It is the fiery crucible in which true heroes are forged. The one place where all men truly share the same rank, regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in.
I say, we need a Kyle VS Wings fight. Who cares if wings beat boogie, a light breeze could knock boogie out. Hell, I bet boogie needs a nap after taking a shit.
Taylor runs PKA
PKA Redditors are special needed. <br><br>Man refuses to go to a house of a man who isn&#39;t even apart of the PKA team, 1 time, and the story most likely isn&#39;t even true since wings is a proven serial liar<br><br>PKa fans - &quot;oh my god, kyle is such a hermit now my god, Kyle is literal the same as wings&quot;
People have been against Kyle for a minute. It just seems amplified now since they can use their newfound support of wings in contrast to Kyle. Kyle shitting on wings is less funny when you see him bitching out of a irl meetup.
Lmao
the pka subreddit has always loved richard and hated the hosts, why is he surprised?
No one hates wings lol
i don&#39;t think keem understands this whatsoever xD, old mate wings finally went through with something instead of talking it up and bailing last minute, he put the work in and actually achieved  something, with his history that match even if he lost was something to respect him for
Imagine exonerating a pedophile cus he “won” a YouTube boxing match lol
The reason for this is that Wings has earned our respect. He went way out of his comfort zone and stuck it to the trolls. Wings deserves praise and recognition for what he has accomplished.
How to Spot PKA Newfags 101.
Funny how he sums it up to &quot;he didnt go on a camping trip so they kicked him off&quot; LMAO. That was one of many things that wings had against him within the friend group. He literally would not show up for most of their shows. He would not wake up for the podcast, which was quite literally the only thing he had to do.
Kyle doesn’t do anything he doesn’t want to do. Miss Taylor’s wedding yep. Doesn’t go to Harley’s boxing even even though asked live on pka- yep.<br>And now this. Can’t say I’m surprised, man can’t even think half of the time on pka because he’s to fucking high.
The Password and FPSRussia post has nothing to do with this lol
Taylor is my pka  Host.
We all know keem message 3 discord trolls for those posts, get a life geek
This is all lies. We don’t hate wings.. We have Woody lol
This is fucking awesome 😂
I thought we only hated Woody when he talks about paramotor, politics and interrupting lmao
Fuck Kyle for realz. Wing’s really styled on Kyle hardcore by showing up to a boxing 🥊 match while Kyle was talking shit from his home after his prison sentence and steroid abuse 😂
Wings has brought alot of the hate he gets upon himself but you have to respect the fact he went in there and risked everything. Yes it was against an opponent he knew was much weaker and less healthy, yes he did it for the money but still he did show up. There is nothing anyone can say about that. Kyle, Woody, his hate channels... <br>Also, i always thought Kyle and Woody wanted Wings out of the podcast and him missing the camping trip was a clear excuse to do what they wanted to do all along. Its clear as day. And how are you gonna kick a man out of a podcast he himself created? To me that is bullshit. <br>Kyle must have been trying to help Wings, spent his own money, etc I get it that it sucks when you try to help someone and that someone says you never did anything for them like Wings has said. But to kick him off the podcast? Nah you were greedy and took what he created. <br>Also, Woody is a creepy pedophile for sure. The way he acts everytime pedophilia is mentioned is so suspicious to me that i wouldnt be surprised if one day we find some skeletons of his... I used to love Woody but i unsubscribed in 2010-2011 when he started giving sex advice to teenagers on his channel. Imagine someone doing the same with Hope or his son  back then? Yeah it wouldnt be funny would it. <br><br>I hope Wings turns his life around and becomes a better person too. Lots of people criticize (sometimes rightfully so) but imagine being in his shoes for one day and receiving the hate he does, on top of being insecure as hell and even having mental issues(we never know, with the concussions he has had). Then there is the support he had as a kid too. Obviously we can&#39;t use that as an excuse but it does matter and mold you as a person. I know that Wings changing and turning his life around probably won&#39;t happen and he might fall into his food addiction again and to the fact that he is in his confort zone but i am pulling for him to become a better person and healthier. With this momentum he has, if he doesn&#39;t turn his life around, he probably never will. Do not waste this chance, Wings. Ask Keemstar for some advice; work with him, etc Keem may be a douche too sometimes but you can&#39;t deny he is a smart motherfucker and knows how to use the system to his advantage.
I&#39;ve been saying it for years and years. Fuck Kyle. :)
keemstar would never understand
Now Kyle has to box wings
I love how many viewers hate the hosts if you hate 2/3 of em just don’t watch it anymore
pretty fucking cool to see everyone collectively being nice to wings.
He gets 1 win and people act like he didn’t put a bucket on a cat and left it to suffocate, or that he named his dog the n-word, or that time he flirted with a teen on Siege while knowing her age😂.
nah kyle&#39;s rep has been slowly getting worse for a while, the guy is a 2face beta cuck that loves himself to the extreme. He conducts himself as a beta by how much he  slates previous guests and to what degree he goes in, boogie was a prime example but there&#39;s been a lot.
Kyle trooning out arc will be great
Kyle&#39;s addicted to fake weed and steroids and his parents are dead or dying. Lmao
Im glad PKA viewers can at least unify under the flag of Taylor being the best PKA host.
Kyles such a better person, if you have seen as much from wings as people who have been around for a while, you’d know wings is literally a p3do HE LITERALLY ADMITTED TO HAVING CP
Keemstars ability to get the most basic facts wrong will never not be funny
The prophecy is fulfilled.
I like when they have that reoccurring guest Taylor on
Kyle not being FPSRussia is his fault
“Oh my god…” lol, Keemstar is so thirsty to be relevant again.
There&#39;s a reason we call him Lyle
we all secretly love wings....
Kyle did 2 months in federal prison. I wouldn&#39;t fault him if he never left his house ever again. But that&#39;s just me.
There&#39;s no PKA without Taylor
I actually liked Wings... I think Kyle doesn&#39;t hate Wings... I think he&#39;s very untrusting of Wings. Kyle isn&#39;t a bad person for not wanting to do something, like Wings isn&#39;t a bad person not wanting to do something. Woody has always been supportive like a dad to Wings, Taylor has Always been on the middle side of Wings. We do need a reunion... it&#39;d be much funnier if Kyle didn&#39;t show up.. LOL
Holy shit. He did it. He found redemption. He finally lived up to his name. I never thought I’d see the day.
A vocal minority hated wings. Most people wanted him to have a redemption arc.
Everybody does not hate wings c&#39;mon man be real lol
The only course of action now is for kyle to get ripped af and beat the shit outta wings 🤷‍♂️
Taylor is the only reason I used to watch, woodys takes on issues are infantile because he is rich and doesnt understand reality, and kyle is just a prick and just a genuinely terrible human, people thought it was an act but I could clearly see that he is actually like that. Glad people are realizing kyle is not a good person.",PT1M50S,0.9957

Imagine getting ratioed by the Roblox community 💀
Technical Comment 6 months later: You have a good strong narration voice to keep my attention I don;t think you need the words constantly flashing on the screen
Didn’t etika’s family say not to hate keemstar and that Etika respects keem very much the old man one I understand but the etika situation idk
This video is probably here for more views and subs thats all
Bro i can answer the one single question the vid is explaining for 6 minutes, because Keemstar is racist
Anyone else thinks that these videos end way to abrupt—
I assume SunnyV2 is a big inspiration..?
That tweet is true though.
Tell me something.  Remember when we all talked about awareness? Awareness is the key to everything from autism to Alzheimer&#39;s. Where did awareness go for assault, sexual assault, pedophilia and all of the other words YouTube and YouTubers are now muting out? Is this pressed by YouTube to edit these words out? If so we need to start asking why and who is responsible specifically for silencing these words.
Very biased.I am not going to sit here and explain everthing but i am going to explain one of your points and why it is wrong.He did kinda ruin the old mans streamers youtube picture but keemstar promised to be his friend and by friend give him promotions.He promoted him more than 50+ times! Then the old man still says he ruined his life after 1 year when that drama was over after about 2 months.
Theres a guy named etika and he just finding some moneys by doing some vids like him and he just rage and he told him to kill erika himself
Keem star was in a stream and said he hopes a kid burns alive and said he hopes he gets cancer <br><br>Keem has called someone a n word with the hard r and is racist <br><br>He accused a old man for being a pedo and he wasn’t even a pedo and the old man cried and left streaming <br><br>He told a suicidal YouTuber ekita to kill himself and called him insane and all this other stuff and he eventually killed himself <br><br>He said to a cancer patient he looked up to said he couldn’t wait to report onto his death and he died I think a few years after <br><br>He’s admitted to doxxing people and even doxxed a youtuber <br><br><br>What a bad human 🤦‍♂️
damn, u deserve so much than 3k, subscribing rn, wish u luck &lt;3
2 months late but I&#39;m really impressed! Amazing video! You&#39;re an underrated creator that deserves more views and subscribers! Wish you luck on your youtube journey!
I legit just found out ts I never watched keemsyar but I knew about him I did watch etika a couple times but wow I can’t believe he did all ts he deserve what happen to him
Why is a 40 year old grown ass man acting like a 14 year old. He is a piece of shit, I don’t see him becoming a decent human being anytime soon
One thing i need to say about the Etika situation, even though he&#39;s not responsible why Etika died, it&#39;s scummy for him to think that he&#39;s trying help and be a fried to him despite he&#39;s literally clowning on him on the internet for views when he knows that he&#39;s struggling.
Nice edits
Keemstar has done many things, but making Etika commit suicide isn&#39;t one of them. Keemstar was being sarcastic when he told Etika to &quot;jump off a cliff&quot;, due to his &quot;antichrist&quot; nonsense. If Keemstar WAS the reason for Etika&#39;s suicide, then he wouldn&#39;t have waited THAT long to do it. Even Etika&#39;s mother defended Keemstar.
He only cares about growing his channel and views!<br>By the way don&#39;t forget to like and subscribe if you like this video!🤣🤣🤣
Etika said we should doe to leave simulation
Keemstar walkthrough Etika&#39;s beliefs and pointing out, like, why there would be no reason to live is a far cry from encouraging Etika to commit suicide. Keemstar didn&#39;t kill Etika. Mental Illness killed Etika. Not only has Keemstar and many others said this same exact thing, but so has his family. It is genuinely repulsive how you people stand on Etika&#39;s grave and just use him for &quot;insert talking point against Keemstar.&quot; There is no excuse for it.
I feel like you failed to portray just how much of a piece of shit this guy is
People just can&#39;t seem to handle harsh words anymore I grew up on the streets and a father who just spoke his mind, I have to say you people are pretty weak, a lot of the stuff he says is super funny and some people need harsh words in order to get the fuck up and do something, and the first viral video where he says the n-word, he was doing a roast battle you f*<b>***</b> morons, I understand he can be childish sometimes but that&#39;s everybody, and in today&#39;s society that&#39;s no doubt, and if you have Mexican parents you know what I mean, cause I have Mexican parents
This is important, if u die today will u go to heaven? Have u lied, stolen used God&#39;s name as a curse word (O-M-G)? Still think your good? According to God&#39;s law, you&#39;re guilty. But wait, God loves you, he made a way out. God so loved the world that he gave his son (Jesus death on the cross) that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please think about it. Repent/believe before it&#39;s too late. Luv you
R.i.P RsGloryandGold<br>He deserved better from the internet. I don&#39;t understand how someone can take enjoyment in this kind of evil
Go to anything Keemstar has posted the comments are filled with &quot;we won&#39;t forget&quot;
Keemstar is a snake<br><br><br><br>But he didn&#39;t kill Etika, he&#39;s a asshole, not a killer
I have hated Keemstar for a while. He just makes everything worse.
damn it why isn&#39;t this longer it was getting engrossing
He&#39;s a pedophile he dated a 19 year old recently what a creep , the defence &quot;but it&#39;s legal tho&quot; ye fucking barely goodjob you barely got away with prison , he&#39;s a creep and doesn&#39;t deserve the platform he has
Mid video keem isn’t as bad as you betray him you’re nitpicking situation that he already apologized for you’re not original🎉<br>You’re bringing up old  situations where he said he was wrong and that he changed his beliefs on be original or look up what you’re doing and get the fax right next time
W channel,  I can&#39;t seem to keep up with today&#39;s conflicts and u get to the point.
What program/software do you use to make your videos? &lt;3
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEmARwcRssE&amp;t=1m06s"">1:06</a> “yeah, he actually said that”<br><br>It’s a joke, he was joking
This video is so biased, you should disclose from the start that you are biased against the person you are covering if you want us to take you seriously! also you bring nothing new to the table, h3h3 made the same points and in a better more entertaining way, lol. you are what would come if sunnyv2 and h3h3 made a collab video, lol. and the timing of this video is not random, you probably are doing this in hopes keemstar loses the keemstar show, or he reacts to your video on it so you can get clout, kinda sad IMO.<br> [im on the h3h3 side btw dont label me as a keemstar defender]
I can’t stand Ethan but I think Keemstar’s slightly worse than him. He’s actually harmed other people.

I believe they call that the &quot;ninja stance&quot;. That with loosely bent elbows, apparently helps stability. <br><br>💫The More You Know 💫
what’s h3 tweaking on
Keemstar is a character
Ethan is top heavy I never understood what Trisha meant but I see it now that I use landscape
You are finally stopping your hard on for keem... I never thought I&#39;d see the day Ethan Klondike Kline ended his infectuation with keem and his channel.
It&#39;s not u Ethan !!! I do keep calling you
And singing love songs at there windows
He has harrassed people with serenading them with music

We don’t talk about keemstar 🎶
Ethan looks like matty matheson
Ethan being unable to finish a sentence and cracking up is so fucking hilarious

I think if Keem wants to box someone, a fight with Jake Paul would guarantee an enjoyable viewing experience for everyone.<br>No matter who loses, we win.
It’s giving mid-life crisis
Keemstar is amazing
I feel like Keemstar and Ethan have sexual tension.
Ethan you&#39;re no better than Keem
Dont complain about death threats and then insult hila, mannnnnnn I’m more scared of H3 fans then I am of K-pop fans
Ahhhh get on with it already ethan… why is there so much filler at the start of your videos… just roll the clip man… makes me not want to watch these highlight clips…. Also I WANT THE OLD FUNNY H3H3 funny ethan back 😃
Keemstar has fans?
5 days only 50 thousands views I understand no talking about them when tate videos get u 4 times that in less then 24 hrs. Kinda just makes sense
What happened? Like I&#39;m probably long behind but what happened with keem this time?
Never stop clowning on Keem. I don’t like H3 that much but the best content of H3 is when they roast keemStar. The only time I’ll tune in loll
You guys are the only reason keem is famous in my opinion

Is this wat h3 podcast is like now? This is shit
Man that dude next to keemstar’s facial reactions are making me die from laughter.. he really doesn’t like him ahahhah
I can’t tell what’s more cringe Keemstar or Ethan
As an introvert this is my biggest fear
SnitchNews lmfaooooo so true
Etan tattle memes brought me here. It’s almost like they both wade in sewage; it’s almost like we all live in a sewer.
This adin stream with keem was hella hard to watch
This guy needs to stop hating on everyone
L3L3
How do people watch this
As much as I hate keemstar, ethan’s stupidity and poor communication skills might be just as bad.
Who the f watches this cringy ass podcast
I haven&#39;t watched this clowns content in a minute. When did he start adding absolutely shitty radio effects from the 90s to his boring podcast. That&#39;s just low effort. It&#39;s literally an old family guy skit. Which was dead &amp; dumb when they did it
It’s really telling of keemstar when you see this video of him, the cringe is something I’d never in my life live down but the way he was acting in general was so immature and just weird
So hard to watch 🫣🤦‍♂
Y&#39;all I can&#39;t stop saying &quot;That CRYPTO shit&quot; in an accusatory tone every time crypto comes up in conversation and normal people don&#39;t get it💀💀💀
theres like funny cringe and physically painful cringe. this is the latter.
Undercover cop vibes
H3 is trash but Keemstar is dirtier trash.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkeD4lHRs2c&amp;t=11m10s"">11:10</a> its not that he was overreacting its the fact that he didnt even know what the joke was and was pretending to laugh lol

Wow... So many years and this beef is still going on?<br>Ethan is pathetic. He talks, acts and reacts in the same way Keemstar does.<br><br>Old Ethan would have roasted the shit out of the current spiteful, bitter Ethan. What a shame.
it’s funny watching Ethan clown Keemstar. Both Ethan and Keemstar are equally cringy bro..
hes that weird uncle you feel like you shouldnt be around alone
I prefer to call him, &quot;Dirtstar&quot;
I have no idea who the f these people are, apart from Ethan&#39;s crew, and I think my life is better for it
lmfao what happened to h3. What the fuck is that background. Dudes just a drama king nowadays. He sounds like he has 3 shots before his podcasts. This shit is sad, it all went downhill ever since frienemies. Won&#39;t be returning again.
Came back to H3 for the first time in 2 years and don’t think I’ll ever come back. Took over half the video to get to the title
Literally why did he get up and start running he was completely still until the guy touched him and in his feeble brain it was a signal to get up and start laughing
Do whatever you want at any age, but self awareness is important. I don’t think Keemstar has realised this yet. He seems like the sort of guy to dab after he’s had seggs
As a Buffalonian, we don&#39;t claim Keem.
The fact that, the first thing he does once comfortable, was talk about another man&#39;s dick and how he hates him. for a 40 y/o You&#39;d think he&#39;d know better not to talk about another man&#39;s dick when introducing himself to new people or a group of people... Lmao.
Man I watched this live &amp; it was the most awkward thing I’ve ever seen. I was a huge fan of the whole faze clan &amp; faze banks but I lost all respect for him once he made the podcast with keemstar.

The fact he just had her standing behind him and didn’t introduce her or ANYTHING 😂😂😂😂 she’s 100% gonna cheat on him if she hasn’t already and based off how he treats her INFRONT of people I’d say that’s justified 😂

"Craig and Keemstar Mop the Floor With DSP’s Face, a Message to Phil From Keemstar & Detractorcon",,18025,635,363,2023-05-18T11:58:37Z,"Keemstar will never not be the gayest YouTuber ever
Keem doesn&#39;t seem to understand, DSP has a personality disorder (among other mental disorders) and his cognition is provably, medically demonstrably, severely negatively affected. To what extent this cognitive disruption is caused by his personality disorder and various comorbities, or due to damaged brain tissue from his chronic ingestion of a neurotoxic substance over a long period of time, cannot be said with certainty, certainly not without a neurological workup and imaging, probably MRI. But the fact that something is indeed medically wrong with him is indisputable; there&#39;s so much video evidence he himself produces, and seems unaware of what the evidence represents. There is no rational way to reach that, Keem. He needs specialist medical attention.
If keemstar offers me 50 grand do join in on something, i would be in. Like him or hate him, he knows how to make money.
he would only really change slightly if his gated pigpen was in danger and he had to move to a more modest place.
detractor-con let’s go!!!
I wiuld volunteer to get in the ring with dsp, oh please please please i would love to do that just for shits and giggles
If you invite him to speak at a panel, you have to pay for him, pay for Kat because he can&#39;t leave the wife behind, find Jasper a top of the line kitty kennel, hire security to keep an eye on Phil&#39;s house while he&#39;s away and then pray he doesn&#39;t get some kind of ear infection at the last minute
The only person Keem could really interview that would be worth anything is Leanna. We heard from John and Howie plenty of times.
DSP said, ILL SHOW YOU BUBBLES!!
lol id say DSps popularity is more akin to a train wreck then an interesting amazing personality like tiger king
The more amazing thing is people keep donating large amounts to fund his addictions and encourage it like jinx. A sad commentary on humanity IMO
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_mJV5iasy8&amp;t=17m32s"">17:32</a> LMAO!! yes, and there would be the occasional lean-in manual ban from Phil where he personally removes someone from his panel.😂
Please Lord i hope they get Leanna, just the grooming accusations alone can be the thing that can get him cancelled.
Keem is a Journalist???  Then I&#39;m the King of America.<br>What article has he published?  I&#39;ve never seen anything of his on the AP wire. <br> Vlogger at best, not a Journalist, Journo maybe.
HEY Keem, I&#39;ll fight him.  Pay me.  What ring?  I&#39;ll beat his ass in the street, but not for free.  Gonna need bail money... let&#39;s talk.
There&#39;s no way DSP makes a panel on a con or whatever.<br>He can&#39;t ban people on real life so if anybody asks about anything personal or WWE champions DSP would just run away.
To keem: I and (other detractors) admire your determination to get Phil to do something but frankly you’re wasting your time with him. Phil doesn’t want anyone to help. And the first step for Phil to get help is for him to admit he’s the problem. He’ll never do that because he blames everyone for his problems. He’s a lost cause and you can’t help a lost cause.<br><br>He’s too toxic for business too. Yes he didn’t show it during your interaction with him on sidescrollers but one that was only so he could shit on you later on his own stream in his safe space. And two, he was hardly confrontational or argumental with you, because he was not in control. Hence why he felt safe crapping on you in his safe space. And he tried to steal your idea because he wanted control and he didn’t want you in the way even though of course the lolcow podcast would never work without you running the business end. Phil will only do things with other people as long as he has control of almost everything. And I bring control up a lot because one, Phil is a narcissist (granted we’re alll narcissists somewhat) and two control is the one thing narcissists crave most.<br><br>Indeed he should have taken your 50k offer but let’s be real, you could have offered him 1 million dollars and he’d still turn that down. He’ll always be on level 1 as you said.
I want him destroyed, destitute and living on the street.  I hate DSP with the fury of a million suns.
He won&#39;t admit he&#39;s an addict cos he&#39;s still doin it !!
Keemstar he hates u, offer to fight him !!!
There is NO salvation <br>NO redemption <br>ONLY the end….
Keem too much of a normie to have seen Geno Samuel&#39;s Chris Chan doc
As much as I like seeing DSP fail, these dudes should fall back some. DSP is already a revolving train wreck and getting involved with his family is too far.  DSP is good enough at being his own detractor.
That&#39;s what keeps Craig and Keem from being true detractors. They WANT Phail to succeed...He&#39;s gone way too far and deserves continued failure.
Phil only has control on his streams. Take him away from that and you get sniveling coward who sucks up to everyone.
This is the golden age for detractor content
Would love to see Phil outside enjoying nature like a human.
He&#39;s not gonna admit it because <i>he&#39;s still spending money on the mobile game</i> lmao.
I love how an inoffensive interview started this downward spiral.
The interview has been the gift that keeps on giving.
I cant wait til dsp is 6 feet under
Phil has no hope he just wants to be stuck in his small pigpen eating the scraps.
I mean we get that dsp is funny to laugh at but Craig’s literally grifting dsp cuz he realized he has nothing else
I get that Keem wants to earn money on Phil’s catastrophic personality, but I feel like they’re being too nice trying to help him. He doesn’t deserve it.<br><br>Truck ton of far better small creators out there who could use help, guidance and exposure from veterans of Craig’s and Keem’s caliber. Get involved with those folks. Quit DSP. He needs to be held accountable for his toxic behaviour, bot offered chances.
It’s called a scammer/conman. That’s what DSP is
personally, I think anyone who has already been in Dave&#39;s content is &quot;fair game&quot; on the whole &quot;if it&#39;s doxing thing&quot; and that includes the pig&#39;s mother, he already put them online and connected them to the brand.
Craig - &quot;Gaming competition....&quot;<br>Me - &quot;Don&#39;t get him to play WWE Champions, he is far too good at that...Maybe try SF2 Turbo on the neo-geo...&quot;
&quot;i know how to get Phil out of his house&quot; 😂😂😂
Im broke i will be a lolcow. Lemme gain some weight i guess first
definitely an ego/pride issue.
I asked chat gpt to wrute a monologue where phil is crying over his failures, it didnt disappoint: <br>(Disclaimer: The following monologue is a fictional creation and does not reflect the real thoughts, emotions, or experiences of the individual mentioned.)<br><br>[Dark room. DarkSydePhil (DSP) is sitting alone in front of a camera, visibly distressed and fighting back tears.]<br><br>DSP: You know, sometimes I sit here and I just can&#39;t help but wonder... how did it all come to this? How did my once-promising gaming career turn into this endless spiral of failure and ridicule?<br><br>[He pauses, wiping a tear from his eye.]<br><br>DSP: I started out with so much passion, so much hope. I thought I could make it big, you know? But somewhere along the way, things went wrong. The trolls, the haters, they came out in full force, tearing me apart piece by piece.<br><br>[His voice quivers as he speaks.]<br><br>DSP: And then there&#39;s the constant reminder of my past mistakes. The times I misspoke, the moments I lost my cool. They haunt me like a dark cloud, following me wherever I go. I can&#39;t escape it.<br><br>[He looks down, his voice filled with regret.]<br><br>DSP: And then there&#39;s Panda... my ex-girlfriend. Losing her was one of the hardest blows. We were supposed to build a life together, but my mistakes and my obsession with this virtual world pushed her away. I miss her every single day, and it&#39;s a pain that never seems to fade.<br><br>[He takes a deep breath, trying to compose himself.]<br><br>DSP: You know, I thought I could find solace in video games. They were my escape, my sanctuary. But somewhere along the line, that escape turned into an addiction. WWE Champions became my refuge, my drug. I poured countless hours and dollars into it, hoping to find some sense of accomplishment or validation.<br><br>[He shakes his head, the weight of his actions evident in his voice.]<br><br>DSP: But it was all a mirage, a distraction from the harsh reality that my career was crumbling, my relationships were falling apart, and I was losing myself in the process.<br><br>[He pauses, his voice cracking with emotion.]<br><br>DSP: I don&#39;t know where to go from here. It feels like I&#39;ve hit rock bottom, like there&#39;s no way out. But maybe... maybe this pain can be a catalyst for change. Maybe I can learn from my mistakes, rebuild what&#39;s been broken, and find a new path forward.<br><br>[He wipes away another tear, his voice filled with determination.]<br><br>DSP: I may have failed in the past, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to be defined by it. I can rise above this, pick up the pieces, and prove to myself and others that I am capable of more. It won&#39;t be easy, but nothing worth fighting for ever is.<br><br>[He takes a deep breath, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.]<br><br>DSP: So, here&#39;s to new beginnings. Here&#39;s to learning from my past and shaping a future that I can be proud of. It&#39;s time to embrace the challenges, face the consequences, and move forward. And who knows, maybe one day, I&#39;ll look back at this moment and realize that it was the turning point, the moment I started to rebuild my life.<br><br>[He turns off the camera, taking a moment to collect himself before facing the uncertain road ahead.]
i’m starting to really respect &amp; like keemstar
I dont understand what level pride DSP has that he cant just give in. A good opportunity if he&#39;d just realise he has flaws and have fun with it
The Truman Show except it&#39;s DSP.
DSP can&#39;t go to PAX. He has the permanent excuse of &quot;oh some psycho will try to murder me which I&#39;M not afraid of. but he could hurt all my tiny little precious payp- I mean fans! I&#39;m worried about YOU guys! <b>points at screen</b> &quot;<br><br>LIke word for word that&#39;s what he&#39;s gonna say.
I genuinely believe there is nothing on Earth that could compel Phil to leave his bubble. When he was on Side Scrollers and couldn&#39;t control the narrative, he looked like a lost kid; the man just doesn&#39;t know how to cope with an environment he isn&#39;t 100% in control of anymore.
Queem lookin like a dirty Tim Pool over there. Bitchass bundle of sticks, anyway.
A Tiger King style documentary about Phil would be great, but it would require footage of him in the wild. Keem should hire someone to do that. I have thought about hiring a private investigator, but it’s just such an autistic waste of money… but Keem could definitely do it 🤷‍♂️
I appreciate that Keem is recognizing the moral dilemma that comes with his interviews, but it&#39;s an equally big moral dilemma to not expose him to people that could potentially become victims/enablers of his in the future. Offering peace to Phil is not only pointless, but it would be detrimental to everyone else involved.<br><br>Be as intrusive as the law allows. He&#39;s practically asked for it at this point.
Even after being super toxic and petty to keem, keem is still offer a truce and a golden opportunity to dsp. And dsp will do a zoom in and go no no no again",PT19M29S,0.9971

Who asks for consent that much?At some point in becomes like a joke. I could totally see Edwin like &quot; HAHA(edwins fake laugh) you&#39;re consenting right!? HAHA! Just making sure! HAHA!&quot;
Good on you Keen for platforming Babz
What a weird set up. Why is she behind you? Wouldn&#39;t it be more professional for her to be at the same table/desk as you two? Just strange lol
Im Sorry I do feel bad for Babs, but who ever the fuck said society isn&#39;t fair to women is full of shit.<br><br>Men go through this shit all the time by ugly bitches and you know what happens with them? &quot;Suck It up faggot, you scored&quot;<br><br>Shit look at the court system and that&#39;ll tell you just how much of an advantage women have.
Im sorry Keem should do the show by himself i miss drama Alert and this show isn’t doing it for me . The girl doesn’t even talk at all if hardly idk theres a reason why this channel hasn’t taken off
Lol wonder what all the salvotards are saying now
Paige is a cringe leftist
Babs treated them much better than they deserved. Fuck them, I knew their clout shot was bullshit and I hadn&#39;t even seen this yet or knew the whole circumstances but just hearing Edloser (bad joke, I know) throw that around because he was under pressure. I don&#39;t know how anyone believes a damn word he says. <br><br>Babs looks so lonely and sad back there, goddamn have her come sit by you guys this is a weird set up<br>Can anyone point me to the harassing Tipster and Augie and them? This shit is so freaking crazy that I&#39;m still trying to catch it up. First two places I heard of it was Nick and fucking Jesska Pizzle of all places lol
Just repeating what a minority group said YEARS ago and you ALL bullied them and laughed it up. Edwin stomped on those people and it&#39;s not OK. Wtf...<br>This is stupid. All of it. I&#39;ve never seen a bigger bunch of losers in my life.<br>Maybe the viewers need to self-reflect. Or get some in patient psychiatric help. It&#39;s weird. For real.<br>That stupid music you play after your stupid points and dumb jokes is so dumb. I thought you retired. Edwin was and is the worst piece of crap and it couldn&#39;t have been more obvious. You could&#39;ve at least considered what people had to say before you dismissed them. &quot;Good reporting.&quot;👍
I know you were nervous but you did great babs, very articulate
Forced/coerced consent is not consent. Pestering someone into consent is not consent. If you&#39;re uncomfortable in a sexual situation, that&#39;s not consent. You may be saying yes, but your brain and body are telling you no, that&#39;s why you&#39;re feeling such discomfort with it. This makes me see Salvo and Edwin in such a fucked up light. I feel stupid that I ever thought these were decent people (Edwin, in particular).
How bad does Xylie smell?
People saying she flew up to stranger like you don&#39;t meet stranger everyday like on dating app or stuff, and like those people don&#39;t try to present good and the  when you meet them they are not what they portrayed to you. It happens
Also why would babs want clout? I mean I don&#39;t even think she has a channel or anything. And people thinking she is accusing them of stuff worst than she is saying proves how bad that behaviour is, like yeah its not totally bad but to me hearing this I am just like.... That sound like the warning signs of getting S3×traf1c if you get what I mean... Like p1mp3d<br><br>I&#39;m kinda pissed too that Edwin is saying he is a victim of Salvo like wtf
Thanks for this video! My only complain is it feels like your co-host is just here... You&#39;re not trying to have a back and forth with her and like, she barely talks... You should try to talk more with her or let her talk, maybe script a bit so that she knows what are the big stuff you want to say and in what order
So when they were going on and on abt &quot;excessive consent&quot; (wtf??) in other interviews, what they <i>really</i> meant was, &quot;we kept pestering the living fuck out of her till she said yes.&quot; 🤦🏽‍♀️ FFS. That&#39;s not enthusiastic consent, that&#39;s coercion.
I&#39;m still unsure what happened why is salvo off the show I thought he was keems yes men
Keemstar &#39;I think it&#39;s creepy that people do age play&#39; <br>Also keemstar &#39;Wait aren&#39;t you 20 years younger than me?&#39; <br>News flash, both are nasty.
This is the very first <i>anything</i> of Keemstar I&#39;ve ever watched, and I&#39;m incredibly surprised by the coverage. Not so surprised by the many, many garbage incel POS&#39;s and Salvo piss-garglers in the chat and comments, tho. I&#39;m glad most call-ins were kind and supportive; Babs seemed... sad, and uncomfortable. Poor thing.<br><br>EDIT: ofc the first thing Flamenco talks abt (defends) is DDLG/age-play, and then immediately lies abt his own history; I only just heard abt this dude recently, but wow, yeah. Real shocker, there lmao
I subbed to Edwin December 26th. Who would&#39;ve known? One thing I do remember, is the stream where he wanted to get more women into the commentary community. No idea what was a joke and what wasn&#39;t but he had a few (female) callers on there and there was talk of a potential competition for &quot;the next great woman in commentary&quot;  in which there would be a winner.If I&#39;m not delusional one of the callers jokingly said, &quot;That could be one of our competitions. Who can compliment Edwin the best? Innocent fun at the time, just strange to look back on.
Brantley is so beautiful and chill af. It really should just be you two on the show, w guests obviously, but I mean as co-hosts
so you see a &quot;man&quot; who wears makeup, has greasy ass hair and kisses dudes and you are surprised he&#39;s a total weirdo... ok
Real shit though, Babz is hot af lol
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXc-sls05U8&amp;t=37m17s"">37:17</a> Jesus Keem… she’s trying to hold back from breaking out into tears (or so it seems) and Keem just starts breaking out into laughter
So they ran a train on babs, high fives and lots of “GET DAT SHITE BRO”.  Then they had gay sex and all of a sudden they were weirded out?  This story is really something
Woah I was a huge Cyr fan, and I had no idea Edwin was the one who chased him off of youtube. I thought after everything with onision he just disappeared for a little bit. Thats really fucking shitty.
i feel so terrible for Babs. its pretty clear in my opinion that she didn’t want to throw anyone under the bus and she felt responsible for what happened but it sounds like felt pressured after them asking for consent so many times which still is not okay. poor thing. she doesn’t want anything from this i don’t understand the accusations of clout chasing
Good show. Can&#39;t watch the Edwin segment, it hurts so much. Cringe overload.
Why did Keem have to decide to make his humorless gf the new cohost? She adds absolutely nothing. She only interjects with little jokes that fall completely flat 100% of the time and derails Keem while he&#39;s trying to get somewhere.
Brentley working overtime to make keem a good man. I laught so hard when he looked scared like „u mad at me“ hahaha This story would be so different without her! I feel like she gives keem credibility and creates a healthy distance to this sh*tshow
This was an dumpster fire altogether Edwin is a snake 🐍🐍🐍 protective of sex victims but sexting others and salvo is an weirdo drinking piss that nasty 🤢🤮🤢
Apparently Salvo has loyalties to slanderers &amp; trash creators like MrSen, GGEvans, &amp; their friends. Guys who will literally just go around calling people pedos with 0 evidence &amp; make stuff up off the cuff. Salvo was on that Crow’s show being buddies with them &amp; Sen &amp; Evans was in full slander form
Baba look so uncomfortable.  Did she consent to this interview ?  I think she doesn&#39;t  know how to say no. Keem ans Brantley are taking just as much advantage  of her as Salvo  and Edwin did.
Lmao OMG guys no wonder Mina went back Home and almost never came back or moved Edwin there. (Yes I know what they said she moved home over)
I was wondering if the whole &#39;Is Edwin and Salvo gay for each other&#39; was just a joke.. but if Edwin was pawning off a girl as hot as Babs to other dudes pretty much confirms that dude is James Charles levels of gay. Babs is gorgeous.
Good on her for not caving like they were practically begging her to. So many females, including myself, eventually cave just because you feel cornered and like there’s no way out so you just do IT to make it  stop and move past out. But they do it again as soon as they’re ready.
I love Brantley and Babs so much 😂🥰
Is the little girl with braces(lol) keems new child gf??
How dont you call the cops on the nerd NOT LEAVING YOUR HOUSE.
Babs is so beautiful f that goofy ahh dude , need a real YouTuber in her life 🥲 a man like who gone protect her and respect her ( that’s me)
Coercion isn’t consent!!!!
Hope ur happy for what u did to edika
Please don&#39;t use f word with the Lord&#39;s name
There&#39;s a Salvo in all of us deep down
This has got to be shadow banned Noway it’s only for 17k views
Babs seems like a catch , she was basically used 😒 I’m glad she found friends in you guys tho !
Keem and brantley handling this story insures that Edwin will come out ok.. literally keem just pushed them for answers he wanted.. and Brantley’s stupid high ass just cut him off every 5 mins
Hey Anti O&#39;s I see you.<br>You people doxed children and families.<br>Get back under the rocks you all crawled out from.
I kind of always suspected Salvo wasn&#39;t putting on an act and he was just some crazy asshole...but Edwin was one of my favorite youtubers for a long time, even a member of his channel on and off for almost a year. He&#39;s been changing his content as well as his character seems to be changing this past year or so, and its not changing for the better. Feeling super Ick about him lately and seeing how he handled this whole situation is super disappointing.<br>Also sending all the love to Babs ❤",PT3H56M,0.791
Keemstar and DSP Finally Confront Each Other During Interview,Credits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQw-IxvvE6c,34901,1128,662,2023-03-16T22:12:15Z,"Phil will stop his stream for a $50 tip, but not for $50K.
Sorry, keem. Can&#39;t answer the phone right now. I&#39;m blowing bubbles are a fully grown man for other fully grown men. Sorry your 50k offer to just show up to work without any set up wasn&#39;t good enough for me. I heard about you online, totally not hypocritical, and i will now take the moral high ground! <br><br><br>Truly, Phil doesn&#39;t think like this, right? Right...?
Im kinda glad keem didn&#39;t waste his money, i feel like dsp&#39;s compulsive lying and stubbornness would&#39;ve ruined it for wings and boogie
I remember ending up watching the whole podcast.<br><br>When they told Phil to just become a politician, it feels like the perfect job for him.<br><br>Man is a natural born liar. How there legit fans of his is baffling.
I dont agree with dsp but neither wirh the others, keemstar is acting like hes the president, when i call, everybody haves to let everything fall down immediatly and get my call 😮 no, you maybe retired and rich but you nothing more than any lther tryhard youtube , good or bad .
i understand dsp is pretty much like a Homer Simpson but seeing Keemstar which i&#39;ve never ever watched any of his content explain the process of Youtube success to Phil so condescendingly but yet he thinks it&#39;s &#39;insight&#39; makes me despise him so much. To act like there is just one straight shot. Some people that don&#39;t act like a lolcow build up a great following and then for some reason or another fade away into oblivion in like 6 months. It&#39;s like a billionaire CEO trying to tell you that if you just start out getting a loan and opening your first business in one or two decades you can be just like him. It&#39;s possible but sure as heck not likely. For every one that makes it in top tier professions there are so many more that fail, but nobody ever focuses on them. I hope Phil steals the idea and gets a silent investor so Keem can cry about it being his idea.
I thought I liked watching two similarly intellects clash, but this is just weird af
Gotta side with Phil here. Why didn&#39;t Keem just call Phil at the right time? Just to flex he doesn&#39;t have to abide by other people&#39;s schedule because he is a bigger youtuber? Keem&#39;s in the wrong here, yet they never address why he wouldn&#39;t just call at the correct time.
Dsp you should have taken the offer instead of acting like ass and throwing false accusations at keem. God dsp have you ever loved some one. Dsp is the matt jarbo of lolcows.
Phil&#39;s so nervous he be sounding like one of those AI speech generators.
Keemstar offered him 50k and he didn&#39;t take it what a clown 😂
DSP calling people unhealthy is the most ironic thing ever considering he had gout and worst health condition lol
DSP is the real life Walter White. He is so close to succes every time, but his enormous ego rather burns it all to the ground.
&quot;You&#39;re amazing entertainers..... just not in the way you want to be&quot;  🤣🤣🤣
Hard to watch. Phil is dying inside in this because Keem is insulting his ego and pride to his face under the guise of trying to help him. Phil has no way to fight back because he can&#39;t play the moral high ground after numerous scandals(remember Blip TV?), has poor debate skills due to a lack of research and a fear of confrontation. These two aren&#39;t completely wrong about each other, but Phil should have just buried the hatchet with this guy a while back and moved on!!...but he won&#39;t!
Huge opportunity missed here in my opinion.
Snake phil will have to answer to the irs 😈 may or may not have sent a concerned tip
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBwH9KzTbVk&amp;t=1m42s"">1:42</a> he’s about to cry😂
Phil schooled him though. Damn.
lmao he looks so fucking awkward and is incredibly docile in this, got humbled hard here
I woulda took that 50k and told em everything about my streaming life lol
Dsp was one of first gamers i started watching on youtube. One day my friends came and asked me why dont you watch this guy he sucks. Then i started paying attention to the stuff he does as a person and not just the games he plays.
Dude for 50k i would do anything you wanted lol
Honestly I don’t think I could ever side with Keemstar, he always talks in a ‘clutching his pearls’ type voice it’s so manipulative and gross. Women’s behaviour.
“You have no self awareness and think you are the center of the universe.” Phil actually said this to another person.
Phil is so meek and agreeable in actual interactions but plays tough guy in his safe space.
This is THE exemplary reason why to NOT feel bad for this guy.<br><br>Think what u will of KEEM; he is absolutely internet business savvy:<br><br>I have never seen one so  delusional about the importance of internet optics (ESPECIALLY on the internet) &amp; practically state “I will NOT better my situation even if it REMOTELY has any embarrassing potential!”<br><br>It is the internet. Put yourself as Phil (hard 2 do yes) but try. Lean into the absurdity for monetization for real life success? Umm, YEAH! “I’m the jerk off dude!” all…day…long.<br><br>Wow DSP. KEEM legit could’ve helped you in so many aspects. &amp; he’s just “nah; I’m above that.”<br><br>Burning bridges on an entire other level; my God.<br><br>Phil NEEDS his last handful of fans? To no longer tip. Best thing that could happen to him-<br>Literally a sink or f-ing swim already situation.
i agree with Phil. keems ego was hurt and these other two goobers are sucking him hard
honestly i see where phil is coming from. he has to be defensive since the mass majority of people hate him.
Phil honestly had the chance to make millions. But he has an ego even worse than Low Tier God&#39;s.
why are there two nobodies in this vid? they look like AI generated humans... vacant stares
He is so watching that boxing match.
I honestly don&#39;t think any content creator with such a <i>disgusting</i> reputation would turn down such an insane deal, basically 50k for free. Only Phil could refuse that out of sheer spite.
The guy in the beanie is worse the pigroach
That “Level 1” metaphor was BRUTALLY accurate.
It is amazing for me how can you make a 41 year old man look like a brainless bum so easily. That looked like parents giving their spoiled wanky kid a life lesson lmao
In this intire debate between Phill and Keem you can see just how weak and hypocritecritel Phil&#39;s points are through Keem.<br>This guy basicly think he is shouting through a window while in reality its a mirror.
Phil was emotional damaged during the interview. He had salty crocodile tears
Two idiots on the same video, great
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBwH9KzTbVk&amp;t=24m25s"">24:25</a> this shows how completely and utterly small minded this fucking moron is. Keem is literally laying it all out perfectly, and his pea size gin soaked brain, can focus on nothing but a goddam audio cord... what a stupid pos.
D S P THE LOLCOW!
I liked watching a weasel bully a weasel. Just a win win in general.
keemstar is just as pretencious and full of himself as phil
The fact every DSP hater ignore and downplay all the bad stuff Keemstar has done and make dumb comparisons between them just shows how they are more ignorant, pathetic and dumb than DSP who they keep complaining about.
two cucks confronting each other!! Priceless!
Did I just hear Phil call Keem delusional? What a time to be alive. Phil kept trying to interrupt Keem. This is like a lion vs a weak antelope.
Amazing how Jasper the 2k kitty wasn&#39;t involved, and there wasn&#39;t a single snort. They really went easy on piggyboy.
“Between the 3 of you, you don’t have the business sense” - lol that had to cut deep
You can see everyone but Phil die of cringe at how Braindead he is.

Keem bumming off a lulcow he going to see boogie next...
Damn I am so glad wings clapped boogie he is a real man
Haha good I’m glad that it finally came together. And years of being trolled and punching boogie square in the nose has made wings a bit charming to me. The Unshakable wings of redemption!
Know wings has done/said some wild shit but feel sorry for the guy
Cameltoe would set onlyfans on fire
Keems goof ass
i’d rather have a family of rats shit into the palm of my hand than have a signature from Keemstar.
I&#39;m so glad I quit playing video games to further myself from someone like keemtard.
i wonder if he has ever seen his own  p hahaha
WHY TF U STREAM THAT SHIT
The real star here is that chair.
<b>clears throat</b><br><br><br>… LOOK HERE.. LOOK LISTEN
Damn wings has decent lookin place
Stop appearing on my recommended paypig
He held that pen like a rt4rd.
He looks like a deflated waterbed
Keem is pro pedo now? damn how the mighty have fallen
Yeah,<br>What&#39;s title is it ?<br>The &#39;slaberweight&#39; 😂
keemstar brings copies of himself now
Why are these people on my feed?
I’m glad to see some positive attention coming to wings for once 😁😁😂😂
Wings is my hero!
converse* not conversate
What is it the 14th? ... proceeds to write down 17
Wings never stood a chance being surrounded by parasites like Keemstar and PKA
He completely bodied Boogie 👀
Keem is cringe af
Keemstar loves girltalk. Never seen a man that loves to gossip so much. Men dont do that.
That chair is begging for help rn 😂
Keemstar is such a horrible human being.
He has towels for curtains and nobody mentioning it
Is he 37? Tough life sitting on his backside
Lowkey ive always hoped wings would get his shit even semi together, or at least lean into his bit more and make it make real money for him. Maybe this fight will do it
Keems a douchebag
100$ that the paperwork that came with that chair says &quot;300lb weight limit&quot;
The pure disrespect of having another man write with a sharpie on your wall... I feel bad for these guys, even in the pre fight it&#39;s a joke at their expense. It&#39;s true these are their moments to shine, but IMO I think other personalities(running the show) could handle the match with more respect. I love these guys and I wish them well
I&#39;m so fucking hype!!
I&#39;m glad you both are together doing this we need something other than IanCuckkz doing this shit.
Wings will be winded in 1 minute flat if he’s not training HARD for this. It will be quite pathetic.
Only reason hes chill with keemstar is cause he sees two bags of money
wings was staring at that wall with such pride while that beautiful gut of his absorbs light.
Couldnt be bothered to stand up...he has 3 rows of tits....just like a cow?!?!?!
Hey this isn&#39;t what I was promised.  All I see is two massive pieces of 💩
Look here, look, listen, appearing in my house won&#39;t f#&amp;@ stop it so stop giving advice you know nothing about.
Is her miserable couse of the upcoming fight or couse there is a Keemstar in his house ?
He puts the whale in landwhale
He looks HUGGEE omgg how can he even stand up
I guarantee that angle was on purpose so we could see the bedsheet that he&#39;s been using for a curtain for the past twelve years. Keem has sneak dissed and trolled him from the onset.

Why does anyone care about what this raving gnome has to say? I thought he stopped being relevant years ago.
common Keemstar L
thank you for letting us all know that the transphobe was a transphobe and wasting everyone&#39;s time, nigga.
Woah really?
Sadly the usual suspects are dragging Keffals on twitter for daring to have Keemstar on her &quot;platform&quot;, despite it being in the service of dragging him kicking and screaming into the light of day to show how much of a shithead he is.
Yeah, the whole I have changed thing. . but all that stuff I said and done wasn&#39;t really bad.  So there is no reason for me to change.  This is coming from a guy who is not an ally, but who is trying to learn.
Nobody thought keemstar is a trans ally and if you had a sliver of a doubt, why didn&#39;t you have a conversation with him off stream first? Because you have a big following of hate-watchers, aren&#39;t you concerned that it boosts his numbers to that audience? Sorry you had to go through that
“I just hit a dog going 70mph on my truck. Such a shitty xmas eve RN. It ran right up on<br>the highway. I hate this year so much.” - keemstar
the racist and transphobic grifter is actually racist and transphobic??? NO EFFING WAY 😰
wow who wouldve guessed, im so suprised that he is and always has been transphobic (not)
So you gave him a couple of hours to change change is a longer journey than that so in order for him to show that give him the Time then
The thing people aren&#39;t getting is that you can&#39;t platform someone bigger than you, Keem was the one that platformed you when he appeared on your stream and in that co-tweet.<br>With that said, I feel as if while you should&#39;ve been more cautious with this situation I think you handled it well.
Seeing as he even treats cis &quot;straight edge&quot; people like the worst shit ever I&#39;m 0% surprised lmao<br>The only line he&#39;s ever drawn was when someone sexualized his own real kid, that&#39;s truly the only time I&#39;ve seen him take some sort of ethic/moral/even logical stance, the rest seems to mostly be to stirr up as much as somehow possible.
We&#39;ve known keemstar&#39;s a stupid bitch ever since he started, I doubt that&#39;ll change
Keffals: &quot;Keemstar, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a trans ally!&quot; <br>Me: <b>pretends to be shocked</b>
knew to never trust a rat like keemstar lmao
Nobody told me Keffals had boobies like this...
I genuinely can’t tell if this is legitimate or a bit. Because how could you possibly have gone into the conversation thinking there was even a chance he wasn’t being disingenuous? I mean, i get the desire to let people change, but, c’mon, really?!
I thought either it was a bit or I was taking crazy pills and none of it was happening
Good on you for giving the chance for him to prove himself. Giving that chance even to people we don&#39;t trust is important.
When has Keemstar not been a piece of shit? Sad to say but it went exactly as expected
WHAT?!?! KEEMSTAR WHO IS KNOWN FOR BEING A PIECE OF SHIT RACIST AND BIGOT FOR YEARS, APPARENTLY ISN&#39;T A TRANS ALLY??? WTF
Keemstar is such a terrible person, I&#39;m sorry you had to endure a mind-numbing conversation with that loser
I don&#39;t always give people the benefit of the doubt, but there are some people out there that I think have some potential to change. Keem is not one of those people, and honestly I think it was kind of foolish to think so. Not to mention, we dont want racists in this community. We dont want people who have made a fucking mockery of suicide in this community. We don&#39;t want people who act in as bad faith as Keem has done in this community. He&#39;s done irreparable damage to other people&#39;s lives, and I never saw any point in trying to rehabilitate his image
Generally providing a space to a fascist will result in the fascist winning what they wanted regardless of how a discussion goes. They want to be seen and disrupt communities and institutions they want destroyed. By giving them a microphone you become their publisher and promoter irrelevant to the actual feelings or views of a host or content creator. And by leaving these appearances up for views it stretches the opportunities for the fascist to be introduced to entire audiences they would have never reached before all off your own channel’s performance. It is effectively hosting a commercial for them on your channel, cause while most your audience won’t agree some will, and as time goes on all contemporary context will evaporate and it ends up being taken sincerely.
Giving people the chance to shit their pants live on your stream is a better bit 😆
The one bit I wish were real is the transphobes turned ally. But alas we’re still in the “let’s hope we never get to the genocide bit with these Nazis.. thanks”
what were you expecting???
Usually I&#39;m all for giving people second chances and allowing them to grow, however Keemstar is that one type of person that really doesn&#39;t deserve that level of charitability because he has made it a career of being dishonest about everything, it&#39;s all a performance for him. I hope that because of this people don&#39;t get dismissive about the concept of rehabilitating former reactionary people, because Keemstar really isn&#39;t a fair representation of that dynamic, at all.
honestly this made me decide to unsub. everyone knew from the beginning he was doing a bit and you pretty much gave light to a piece of shit who was the reason for etikas death. your content was so good at one point but its just turned to shitty reactionary videos and arguing with people who dont matter while also giving them the attention they desired. i hope this doesnt get any worse than this.
He’s a horrible person he is irredeemable there is not one single thing good about that mistake of a garden gnome
Who would have thought.
Yeah.. Just what I expected..
What did you honestly expect from a retarded pedophile that thinks mental illness isn&#39;t real, told etika jump off a bridge, accused tony of being a pedophile then continued to bully after getting brain cancer. No one should be engaging with such a worthless shitstain
wow who would&#39;ve thought
Can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t expect the most obvious outcome.<br><br>Edit: Also, his tweet wasn&#39;t even a little funny.
Wow. Who would have guessed.
I will simply state that a multiple video arc of coverage of his antics was the desired outcome for him and you appear to be facilitating it here...
keemstar is one of the worst people i have ever seen. he is a genuinely horrible person. i dont assume everyone is incapable of change, but keemstar truly is a very bad person.
I know nothing about Keem, can I ask what he&#39;s about?
What was he cooking?
Wow, who would have guessed
I always have a belief that people can change but keem is a different breed of person
I&#39;m not shocked it was a bit, but I agree with you it was worth teasing out to confirm that it was a bit.  For some people, it won&#39;t be a bit!  We need to be able to distinguish from the people whose views actually change to those whose don&#39;t.",PT2M17S,-0.9966
How Keemstar Causes Internet Drama Power Of The Internet Episode 003,"Shop my merch: http://www.merchland.net/boogie2988

I couldn’t disagree with Keem more about losing perspective because you dropped your character for a while. <br><br>When you’ve opened up to us about your struggles with depression and anxiety, I don’t think someone like Keem could understand that being relatable and showing empathy can help your audience, who may be going through similar struggles. <br><br>It’s a lot easier to forgive someone when they occasionally drop the charade and act like a real human being to the public.
Thanks
I thought his channel died..
I will never understand why keemstar acts like he’s still in his teens 😭💀 bro is old asf prolly dyes his beard
FINALLY you did this BOOGIE  ! this was a GREAT convo ! Also I dont think I would have 70 million views without YOU.  Stoppin by to say hi big sexy

Keemstar on mve
Okay , so I watched this through because I enjoy your work Boogie, and I want to see you continue to succeed.<br><br>I was curious whether Keemstar would say anything to shake my view of him. He didn&#39;t. For me, drama YouTube has always been dull and it came across as very staged. I&#39;d happily watch a more positive YouTuber on loop than drama shows any day of the week.<br><br>Putting aside the bad stuff that has been said about Keemstar, and looking at this based purely on what he&#39;s said himself here, I just don&#39;t get the appeal. He&#39;s arrogant, and it felt like he&#39;s deflecting criticism for the most part.<br><br>Keemstar is also not the bad guy he&#39;s trying to be. The best bad guys have substance. He has a hokey delivery style and a desire to stir stuff up. I can&#39;t hate him because he doesn&#39;t grab me in a way that makes me care enough. It has been years since I watched one of his videos, and it&#39;ll be a long time before I try again, if I do at all. He&#39;s honestly just not worth dedicating time to.<br><br>And to answer the question asked : I have no issue finding things to watch on YouTube and it has recommended plenty of fun stuff to me. So, no. I&#39;m not bored.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXdd_aOu7Q&amp;t=31m28s"">31:28</a> However that was not how Mr. Beast rose to fame. And like him there are hundreds more out there.
Never heard of someone telling therr parents that they wanna be a clown when they grow up
Wonder if keem was pulling those same strings he boast with etika or anyone els hes gone after for nothing
4,000.00 is a ton of money to me 😭
Fun stuff
Idk anything about keemstar (or boogie, really) but hes right about the cancel culture thing. People who want to &#39;cancel&#39; ppl want them to squirm and deny or apologize. They never attack ppl who are openly racist, for example. Bc he wont deny it and, as vile as it is, THEYRE proud of it. They own it. They want someone who will apologize so that to them its a small victory.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXdd_aOu7Q&amp;t=20m45s"">20:45</a> I&#39;m max lvl on RuneScape lol. It is awful It&#39;s a good chat room but an awful game.
HUGE
never followed keemstar
How right keemstare is now a days going on YouTube there is nothing to wach now a days so now all I do it get so bored
who knew that keemstar caused drama? what a shocking revaluation
Since RichTechUSASS is taking a break, we&#39;re gonna need you to be the new Rich, and do a bunch of weird Bird/Horse stuff.
Your as nostalgic as newgrounds &#39;imma just say that dere.
Dang dude your face looks like it got messed up
4 million sub channel and you cant get the audio right?
Bashurverse almost is the same like keemstar and his &quot;Employee&quot;.........😂😂😂
Best Interview yet
Keemstar is the biggest poosie and cannot be identified as a MAN 😅😂
thank you for puttting this out , been trying to explain to my soon to be 14 year that  its not just putting a vid out , he want to be an youtuber when he is older
Personally I don’t have any problem finding stuff to watch on YouTube but then again what I watch is no where in the wheel house of the type of stuff Keem puts out.<br><br>That being said he is correct in that YouTube tried to push stuff at you often times getting in the way of what I actually want to watch. It’s why I often find myself just manually going into my favorites and manually choosing what to watch.
I would say I&#39;m not bored with content... then again, I&#39;m subscribed to over 300 channels (inc. non active) - I just keep well away from the recommended / curated content, manually select the channels with updates... and screw the  &#39;shorts&#39;.
What’s up, Boogie2988 of the internet. I’ve been a fan forever and I never gave up on you. So glad to see you doing well. You got me into Hearthstone long ago with WowHobbs. I’ll always be a fan of you Boogie. ❤️
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXdd_aOu7Q&amp;t=28m04s"">28:04</a> I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say we&#39;re living in a simulation (my personal belief;) but rather because of my spirituality a playground to the gods. I believe theres a higher power judging our every move; to see if we&#39;re capable of progressing into a more powerful and ethereal dimension / new reality. This Earth is only one of many many many planets. And if you think we&#39;re the only ones breathing; being watched; thats within your right of expression and beliefs. However it doesn&#39;t seem logical. Consider the &quot;for every action; theres a reaction&quot; theory as well. For every bit of dark; there&#39;s light. Thats what keeps me going.
I wish I could hug you for 34 seconds to take it all out crying of suffering. I know that feeling when people treat you like it is, but people don’t know they hurt your feelings. It sucks to live like that, pretending you are not socially anxious. After mathematics, social anxiety is a f-ing mental abuse. I played pool with a good stranger, I won and I enjoyed that “Very well” and “high five”. Something I don’t receive too much from people, even my family when I win in any game” As an autistic person, I wish I could show who I really am when I’m not anxious. If I could show so much! AAGGH!! I would love it!
Why tf did yourube tell me that this trash interview between two garbage humans was new?
I think you left your microwave open 😂
This is just one of the reasons why boogie is YT Royalty, one of the daddies!
Keem could be blamed for how messed up the internet is, but I must admit, he&#39;s good at it
Keem give me a chance to be the new news guy on drama arletr give me one chance am perfect for this I am a small time infilancer who has an amazing life I love the bissniss of clout and I am interested in the job I will work for free forever of you want I want da clout badly
Keem is the big good guy
I don’t care for this person. But I made sure to watch a small part of the video and give it a thumbs up. I did so because I really like this series and want it to continue. Thanks for the content and keep it up.
Keemstar casually saying that he is the bad guy and does it just to benefit him lmao. This man’s whole mindset is absolute fucked because it was literally tormenting peoples lives
Great work boog
ohhh, good ole schemestar
The fact that keem exploited you and made fun of and you think he is being nice u are delusional
Boogie— I think you’ve found your voice. Keep doing these long form interviews. You’re actually a natural at it. You just need to invest in some mic’s. The audio wasn’t the best here.  Despite that this is great content.
This guy seems incapable of sharing an opinion without swearing every couple words. I do understand it here and there but he literally does it in nearly every sentence! He also doesn’t seem to have an ounce of humility. I think this word is overused but…he sounds like a narcissist. This is actually my first exposure to the guy. This isn’t what I expected. I’ve only heard his name mentioned a bunch of times in relation to internet culture. So I’ve never watched his content. But I have to say I’m not impressed. 🤷‍♂️
Whenever someone tells me that they think this is all a simulation I think it’s important to immediately punch them in the face. This is not a simulation — God  gives us free will to choose.",PT1H15S,0.9995

The Deserved Fall Of Keemstar | Drama Alert,"🔔 SUBSCRIBE IF YOU ARE NEW AND TURN THE BELL ON 

In this weeks video, I go over one of the, if not the most hated person to ever grace the internet, Daniel Keem. Daniel, whose alias online is Keemstar, is a news covering youtuber who mostly makes light of feuds between famous creators. He has done a lot of things in his past that are quite literally unforgiveable and most are simply deplorable. I explain how Keemstar's Downfall came about and how he architected it all by himself.

Big up Tony, oweeeeeeee, rsgloryandgold was a champ, rip Tony you’ll be missed
The only thing you can somewhat blame keem for was the etika stuff
Keem didn&#39;t even fall off though. He&#39;s judt doing other things now
This is the  worst shitbive ever seen.  Keem behind the scenes is fkn loaded.  FALL?  ok if u say so. That guy is takin W&#39;s all the time..
The DramaAlert channel has since been left in the dust
His born on 1982 not 1992
Keem is a textbook narcissist and it&#39;s actually fascinating to see. It feels like you&#39;re watching the stereotypical villain in a romcom. How is this a real person?
That poor old man. I feel so bad for him only if he ain’t homophobic or transphobic or racist.
What a sad human being.
He’s 41 born in 1992? The math isn’t mathing
WAT, HE&#39;S A 92?? I THOUGHT HE WAS FROM 82
I gotta love how he says twitchin again. Like hes cooking or something
Not really his downfall. He simply retired after his views stagnated. He&#39;s rich so i dont blame him. He has a young girlfriend and living his best life tbh. So if you think him cashing out on a high is a downfall then that&#39;s just ignorant lol
can you just stop weaponising etikas death everyone who makes keemstar hate videos. STOP weaponising etikas death. YOU are disrespecting the wishes of a grieving mother
Watch his old shit its gold xd
Before wvwn watvhing the guy didn&#39;t fall xd hes toooooo old for this shit n finally acknowledged that xd
1982*
Guy was a prime example of how humanity is a mixed bag of good people and peices of trash. Sometimes it does good to look at people like this as an example of how never to be.
Sometimes I wonder how I never know who any of these childish streamers are and then I remember: I have a great career, no weird fake social &quot;nuerodivergent&quot; disorders, and choose to participate in life.  Imagine hooking your life&#39;s worth to idolizing twitch streamers. Holy shit man. Wow. I&#39;m pretty sure Keemstar has Autosm. And you people follow him! What does that say about you??<br><br>The old guy passed away from brain cancer? Keemstar needs his ass whipped in the street. Tar and feather this gremlin looking ass.
Hop on the next trend super early tag video right and get that algorithm banging
Subbed wish you uploaded a bit more. I think you could blow up if you did
His YT channel is a ghost town atm
You forgot the feud with ImJaystation
It&#39;s wierd cause 2021 he was prerty active and slowly I think he finally lost attention<br>The youtube boxing wave seemed to have gone without him too...<br>It&#39;s like half the people in 2016 wanted him gone but the ither half didn&#39;t and finally every body just didn&#39;t care for the same shtick
He was born in 1992?? I thought he was about 45
He was born in 1984, not 1994.<br>Keemstar is 41 years old. 👍
an odd internet entity
Well put together
I appreciate you said &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; in the same list
tbh i never kept up with any of these dramas so you educated well in this one lol

WHY DOES WOODY DO THAT WITH HIS FUCKING EYEBROWS, STOP DOING THAT ETHAN KLEIN SHIT
Boogie Balboa
Honestly with his hair and beard I almost couldn’t recognize him
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s sadder, Boogie2988, or making your living talking about Boogie2988
Boogie probably meant Alanon, The support for family members who are alcoholics.
Maybe Boogie will turn into the next Blade.
did he get shot at??
I was in bed and I farted 💨💨💨🤢🤮
If you read the script one of these shows you think it was hosted by 3 11-year-olds
I&#39;m pretty sure that Boogie has said he literally never drank because he didn&#39;t want to be like his alcoholic Dad.
Funny but I hope they didnt actually give a recovering alcoholic booze
Wish keem would come hang out with me in my goon cave
Alcohol contains a lot of calories
If it were true, there&#39;s no way we wouldn&#39;t know about it. Boogie would have been shouting from the rooftops about his noble and heroic struggle.
Woody truly has a hard time not being the center of attention
You can be an alcoholic AND overeat, Taylor 😂
Yeah he visitied both wings and boogie to sign contracts and finalize the bout. We might be getting that fight boys
messed up
They went to wings house too

3 years later this video still bangs
keemstar is a cruel little gnome. Genuinely evil.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3gXcIifc3o&amp;t=30m45s"">30:45</a>
Oh my god I’m a few minutes in and crying, that poor old  man oh my god…
so glad hes irrelevant now. u know he hates it
He looked healthier here
Keem’s 1000% used that mental health shield since this beef ended.
wow I had never heard of Keemstar, this guy is a POS human being and the biggest narcissist in the world. I&#39;m sure he does a lot of what he does because he is just such an insecure little man.
u look skinny ethan
I have become emotionally numb due to big amounts of different content I consume online long time ago. But this moment, when Keemstar used vulnerable Etika? When I saw that mfking evil smile as Etika went on in his manic state - that&#39;s the first time for years I genuinely wanted to puke from understanding other human&#39;s nature.
Keems the dumbest sociopath ive ever met 😂
&#39;bro, &quot;blah blah blahblahblah&quot;? You&#39;re the news guy!&#39; Get him Ethan!
“We were never friends c**t” will always be my favourite idubbz quote 😂
Fact checking everything in this video makes you look worse than keemstar
i hope i see a video of him getting curb stomped one day
when this came out I think I was to young to comprehend how serious this was. Fuck this piece of shit.
I wish Desmond never died
What happened to you h3?
I HATE Keemstar. Everytime I watch drama videos about old drama stories from YT History, he weasels his way into EVERY story, it&#39;s ANNOYING! I HATE it. I cannot take him.
Ethan, you made a lot of good arguments against Keemstar. My only issue is that you knew about the kind of person that he is and what he’s done for a long time but only decided to make a video compiling it all when you started having issues with him personally. This makes it seem like this is based solely off of revenge instead of genuine concern.
How is he not in prison?
This is really how this beautiful channel died, fighting keemstar. H3h3 let keemstar be the lasting legacy of this channel
Rest in Peace, Tony ❤
Social anxiety is a fake illness? Wish I knew that when I broke down at the thought of thousands of people judging me at a concert I really wanted to attend.
Somehow missed this video when it first came out. It almost seems like Keemstar has finally done some soul-searching and has decided to stop doing Youtube altogether. Either that, or he&#39;s just too much of a wuss to handle the (well-deserved, by the way) &quot;hate.&quot; I hope I never hear anything about him ever again, until/unless whenever H3 makes a joke about him, or he passes away. Not that I wish for that, but... I&#39;d just like to know. It&#39;d be kinda... ironic... if he killed himself.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3gXcIifc3o&amp;t=29m40s"">29:40</a> holy shit. <br><br>Even in mania it&#39;s still clear to Etika how horrible Keem is as a person
Keemstar Cycle:<br>&gt;Passively harasses, gaslights, and manipulates individuals to trigger an outrage<br>&gt;Makes money and followers off of the attention and strokes his ego<br>&gt;Whenever attacked he gaslights, emotionally manipulares, and lies to get his way out<br>&gt;Lay low, act sorry for a second<br>&gt;Repeat
its crazy how the roles reversed and now H3H3 has become the scum of youtube that nobody respects
Just in case anyone who stumbles across these videos in 2023.... You should know that tony died in October of last year from brain cancer. He was such a sweet dude who was just happy to have fans and keem deserves to never live that one down.
It really upsets me whenever I remember Keemstar is alive.
Humans are so fragile that words are capable of killing and keemstar the snake exploits this for clout. It’s just so sad that someone so evil has such a big audience.
Hi
What Keem did to rsgloryandgold was really unacceptable. Tony (rsgloryandgold) was a great guy and I watched him without even playing runescape just because of how nice and amazing hew was. Unfortunately, he passed away on Oct 12th 2022, but RIP to such an endearing and nice guy.

I need some of that
I don’t know you why would I talk about you know
This clip didn&#39;t age well cus you&#39;re now worse than Keemstar with the false accusations 😭🤣
Keems awful in every way. His career started by him being an ass and he never grew out of it.
Rest in Peace Tony. Sorry k¹ller cumstar took years off your life. I hope you&#39;re finally resting easy and have peace not existing on this planet with this demon. We know you didn&#39;t do the things he accused you of. He was projecting his own transgressions onto you and that&#39;s even more evident now.
I love how he ruined people&#39;s lives with false p³do allegations and dates teenagers and makes comments about how it&#39;s okay to mess with a 16 y/o.  The irony is too deep.  I had to come back and watch this again because I forgot how good it is.

Keemstar&#39;s sociopathic tendencies are a matter of grave concern. His blatant disregard for human lives and his propensity to view individuals solely as means to financial gain is deeply troubling. The responsibility he bears for the tragic death of a fellow YouTuber, whom he callously encouraged to take their own life during an interview, is an undeniable reality. What is equally distressing is his refusal to accept any accountability for his actions and the dire consequences they have wrought.<br><br>Additionally, Keemstar&#39;s involvement in a swatting incident targeting a YouTuber, streamer, and devoted father cannot be overlooked. Despite his denial, the evidence clearly points to his complicity, as he deliberately shared private information about the individual on Twitch, effectively engaging in a highly illegal act akin to a DDoS attack. This reprehensible action ultimately led to his followers, acting as pawns in his game, swatting the victim, putting their life at risk. Keemstar&#39;s convenient denial and evasion of responsibility further exemplify the serious nature of his actions.<br><br>Furthermore, Keemstar&#39;s habit of falsely accusing individuals of pedophilia without any substantiated proof is deeply troubling. The repercussions are far-reaching, as the accused individuals and their families become targets of threats and harassment. Keemstar&#39;s refusal to acknowledge his role in these damaging accusations and offer apologies to those affected demonstrates a severe lack of accountability.<br><br>For those seeking concrete evidence supporting these claims, I strongly urge you to watch the video titled &quot;Asmongold Reacts to &#39;Content Nuke-Keemstar&#39; by H3H3Productions.&quot; It delves into the depths of Keemstar&#39;s actions, shedding light on the gravity of the situation. It is crucial to address these serious matters with the utmost sincerity and ensure that individuals like Keemstar are held accountable for their harmful behaviors.
Raid Shadow Legends... Cmon Keem
It’s all your fault
You killed him
Never forget what you did you pariah

I give the twitch streamer we found the body two middle fingers
I miss dramaalert... fucking youtube... :(
Keemstar is actually mentally ill¡!!!!!! It&#39;s confirmed by his doctor
Most Americans act like this , and the people in the comments too acting surprised 😂 you know Americans know use all talk like this, you just decide when. Fuck all of y&#39;all 😂
I&#39;ll never forget what you&#39;ve done
It’s funny to me that Keemstar is so shocked by this when he is just as, if not MORE deplorable than this guy. I’ve seen him do far worse things than this… the irony. Smh. We won’t forget all the things you’ve done.
Scamstar. Douche.
My cat died 🐈 rest easy Kitty 💔💔💔💔
Don’t agree w/willful harassing people<br><br>But this dude needs non stop snipes to the “head”. Just repetitive harassing

👨‍🚀 About Dennis Feitosa:
What's up? My name is Dennis Feitosa and Def Noodles is a show I created. For business inquiries partnerships@defnoodles.com",2548,124,54,2023-06-20T13:00:00Z,"Not funny
Keemstar was a sinking ship and H3 was the one to sink it.  However, Dennis tried to assist and got taken down with Keem 😂.  The record is: Dennis did a bunch of shady stuff, got called out on it, sued the person and got countersued, then mutually dropped the lawsuit because he didn’t have the money to go forward.
The hair cut, the coping, The cringe. Keen star for the win.
AND WE Will never forget how Dennis is a cry baby who runs amd sues…..<br>😊
Why does he look like can’t fucking stand you 😂😂😂😂 omg help! 💀💀💀
Over 500,000 subscribers and currently an average of under 2,000 views per vid
What’s ridiculous is that you falsely accused Papa Gut of being a PDF File and put his face on a shirt of him crying about his wife’s SA and got a slap in the wrist. <br><br>Good riddance.
He looks like Keem!!!
❤ Love the interviews! Go Def go!
Keem never &quot;takes ownership&quot; of anything, Keem is never remorseful for anything. The man is a snake period. It he paid you off and pretended he was remorseful it was because it made his life easier in some way, his lawyers probably advised him to settle.
I hoppe só now you are good
So i take it you basically won your case? Man I&#39;ma need up see some serious evidence to believe keem is changed for the better. I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s actually sorry about anything he&#39;s done this multiple times knowing full well the effect it has.
Your attorney looks like he loathes having to talk to you even after finishing your ridiculous lawsuit.<br><br>Is he also helping you sue that poor girl who you exploited, abused, and put her life in danger through your utter lack of responsibility?
whoever cut your hair needs to give you a refund mate they absolutely violated you 😂 ps. me and my wife love you, im english and just married a brazilian and for some reason anytime we watch you she says “dennis feitoza” like 100 times 😂 sorry if i spelled it wrong 😂
&quot;A lot of people are here.. &quot; No bro, no one is here. You blew up your little career. Appreciate the shit out of Keem for letting you off the hook, and he&#39;s a douche so call yourself lucky.
All washed up YouTuber’s end up working with Keem. Nothing different here. 🤣
You and Keem have a lot in common. You’re both morons, washed up and people hate you.
Will there be updates on the Tiana lawsuit?
why haven’t you covered the colleen ballinger situation ?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUceNwMPz-M&amp;t=0m17s"">0:17</a> cringe. How embarrassing of a reaction from a grown man lol
Yo Dennis <br>Your lawyer’s fiiiiiiine af
Joe going beard to beard with Keemstar and thing got pretty hairy... what they mean by resolved is that Keem settled with him outta court for an undisclosed amount
Keem and this guy fell off hard
thank you Joe for your service!!!  Thank you dennis!!
You have the worst hair ive ever seen lmfao💀
Thank you for sharing ❤
your lawyer will retire after having you as a client
Yes, THANK YOU for telling us who this guy is at the front, thank you Dennis!
I&#39;m so glad you two came to an agreement, and I look forward to the podcast! It&#39;s going to be so interesting!
Dude no one cares
Def noodles has joined the ranks of DSP and boogie, we all come to point and laugh at this point , nobody likes him 💀
Omg I wish this interview was longer. Holy Shit
Yikes
I&#39;m gonna have to witness Keemstar being a genuinely good dude to believe that he&#39;s changed. And keeping your friends close, but enemies closer isn&#39;t a bad thing!!!🤘🤣💯😉✌️
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUceNwMPz-M&amp;t=5m22s"">5:22</a> dude kinda sounds like keem
I&#39;m glad you got that mess out the way. Happy Tuesday
Please stop sueing people. Everybody knows what Keemstar is.
Mutual respect for Keemstar? What? lol No. Stop.
Good morning. Love the fresh cut. 🎉

Man it&#39;s been a damn minute since we had a proper DSP arc, let&#39;s hope it&#39;s a wild as the Bankruptcy Saga
Jenna, Kat’s wife? Am I missing something?
Even though keem is most likely bluffing, he is doing gods work.
even though i don&#39;t see it happening, i would love to see keem interview phil&#39;s parents and ask them what they think of his wolverine story, and how he portrayed them in it. just out of curiosity :)
This is gonna be good! Never cared for Keem, but man, this is better than Game of Thrones!
I did not see that coming, and I must say, this is a welcomed twist in this dsp storyline. Except for that Side Scroller interview that went disastrously for dsp, it&#39;s been more of the same for far too long.
He needs to talk to his exes sister. She had some good dirt on him saying he cut them off and wouldnt let her talk to any family or anything
Wing&#39;s nextdoor neighbor Aaron will make a surprise appearance.
Holy batman crappie he messed with the wrong person wonder is that why he took day off
Jasper is gonna reveal of all the pet expenses 😂😂😂
But will we bring up Keemstar on the Pahdcast after we are officially done with Keemstar for the 11th time now. Keem is going to interview Jasper
friends? what friends?
Why did Dsp feel the need to bring up oic return after 6 weeks!!!??<br>Very suspect
John? Probably more likely Howard, which would infuriate DSP on a whole other level xD
I love this! Keemstar could be bluffing just to rile up Phill and it&#39;s already had a huge effect. I doesn&#39;t even need to be real and dsp is already fighting windmills. Quixotic pig roach syndrome hahahahaha
Oh no... Dsp is gonna be so pissed about this. 😂
What a great time to be alive
What friends?
We guessing mama and papa Burnell and maybe the soon to be ex-wife?
Leanna interview cooming soon most likely
doody is lowkey trying to get his own detractors if he keeps using microsoft edge
Panda or bust. Other ppl are irrelevant
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Keem just posted this to troll DSP and get under his skin. It&#39;s obvious DSP has no friends and his only family is his parents and his wife. I think it&#39;s just a crock TBH.
You already know how I fell about kumdump rat boy keemstar little punk ass
Keemstar is the goat
Uh oh spaghetti o&#39;s
I honestly think Keem is trolling. Especially on his day off. Phil can&#39;t help but talk about Keem every time he posts about dsp. He&#39;s just baiting him.
A BURST OF SATISFACTION
Keem just pulled a Darth Vader full dark side of the force move and jizzed all over DSP’s grill 😂💥🙌
This is gonna be great! Lol.
Haha, if this is true this could be the biggest goldmine ever. And i dont blame Keem, i means its not illegal so DSP wouldnt have a leg to stand on trying to prevent it.
Secret limited gonna have a field day with the 2023 recap.
Looks like the distractors got unbanned just in time for fire khantent
Dave is going to regret messing with keemstar.... Fabulous 😂
The friends part has to be John Rambo &amp; Howard...The family part, imo, Panda Lee.
Lol dsp about to explode on stream kek 😂😂😂😂
Interview with family eh, so according to dsp they must be interviewing Jasper 🤣
I hope the events of this arc carry over into the next.<br>Been really sloppy that the writers keep dropping any repercussions for pigler.
Unless it is Panda or Kat, these interviews won&#39;t be worth that much.
DSP DESTROYEDDDDDDD
The Saga to end all Sagas
This is where the fun begins.
Ohh muhh loorr they really need that money 💰
PandaLee or Kat&#39;s sister is more likely. Not sure if Kat&#39;s sister knows DSP enough, but PandaLee lived with him for years. I don&#39;t see it being Kat herself. Could you imagine though? 🤣🤣
Remember, my American friends: Your taxes bailed this lying prick out with his bankruptcy (fraud, allegedly), and has the temerity to say on record, through Side Scrollers, that he couldn&#39;t itemise $5000 per month on business expenses as declared with the bankruptcy hearings.<br><br>Sic &#39;em, Keem.
All because he started drama around Keem&#39;s retirement. It&#39;s ironic how he is again his own worst enemy.
What if Kat is being interviewed? If they are divorcing, she probably wants to expose his ass and make a boat load of money in the process. I suspect she won’t play nice like Panda did.<br>Imagine if she revealed all the evidence of Phils mobile game spending?
One shall stand<br>One shall snort.  er.  I mean fall

You all are doing great and thanks for keeping me entertained this evening 😝Have a happy day!
Swift will do anything to keep from working a normal job
They&#39;re just trying to stay relevant in 2022. Boring 👎
Honestly it was just a stupid joke, it was really unprofessional and inappropiate joke towards a member of the LGBTQ+ community, but that doesn&#39;t make Jesse transphobic. Americans just like taking everything offensive and boycotting the person who really didn&#39;t mean any harm.
I derfinitely though jessie owned storyfire he always said it before he left youtube supposedly
Today is the first time i ever heard about any of this, Ive just been under a rock for 8 months apparently.
There are cartel and terrorists brutally murdering civilians for clout, but these people are more worried about &quot;dead naming.&quot; America is pathetic.
How does Keem not fire his co-host? He’s a colossal asshole and not in an endearing way.
Kids dont need to see these transmissions
what ever happened to the boxing match??
don&#39;t over talk when keemstar
Salvo probably one of the worst humans ever 😂
You can get a much better co-host. One with any sort of brain.
Salvo is so freaking annoying get him outta here!!!!!🥴🥴🥴
So disingenuous to hear keem talk about this stuff like he’s supportive of it. He OBVIOUSLY doesnt agree with the trans movement. He’s just taking the opportunity to shit on Jesse
Emily is utterly pathetic
I cant stand the dude on the left and its making me not want to watch this.
The dude on the left is a child amd reading comments and playing into them.  Be yourself.  Dont be on a podcast
God that person in the green shirt is annoying its like stfu and take it serious...
im with jessie on this one😂
Keem’s Friend is such piece of crap that he makes Keem look good lmao

Just fyi about the suicide percentages 82% of trans ppl have considered suicide and 40% have attempted
Glad keem the transphic racist has a real opinion
We all know keem and the other dude think swift is an annoying attention seeking weirdo
Jeff is lucky its not F@G keemstar roasting him
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTIn5CPIkXQ&amp;t=3m08s"">3:08</a> that shit got me dying 🤣
Swift isn&#39;t anything but a damn super annoying clown and an overgrown nuisance who&#39;s only doing this whole trans shit because he&#39;s desperate for clout, relevancy, and attention, and the same goes for all those other washed up, irrelevant, one-hit wonder YouTube circus rejects that tried making up shit about Jesse. Swift&#39;s a guy, plain and f-ing simple, he can play pretend princess, dress up, and put on all the make up he wants, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s never going to change how he came into this world.
Atleast this trans man has respect... what joke he laughed his ass off
24 hahaha u listen well it was 26 xD
Jesse definitely said the B word lmao
this podcast kept me alive. now its over
Swift that Peter Griffin laugh entertained nobody.
Keen again with the fake cringe laughing
i heard about this drama months ago and honestly i didnt put my take on it, Because people who support Jessie are cult followers because if Jessie tells them to jump off a bridge, I honestly think they would honestly,<br><br><br>Anyway going to put my take on this drama, i honestly think Jessie loves bullying Emily, and Jessie has been bullying @YegsTv on Yegs stream Jessie would go on yegs Minecraft worlds behind yegs back and destroys his stuff in the Minecraft worlds honestly, i would say to people if you get dms from Jessie asking you do you want to live with him and the stream house, say no because Jessie only cares about himself honestly, and if Yegs reads this you need to get out of Jessie&#39;s house while you can, because jessie going to pull you in to his stuff like he going to try to make you like him from 2015,<br><br><br>and honestly i think Jessie is the fakest person in the world, Jessie would take a piss out of people behind there backs to other youtubers, and honestly some people support jessie idk if they trolling by supporting him, but honestly people need to unsub to him honestly, Jessie is not Jessie he would laugh things off.<br><br><br>My bottom take of this is, Dont trust Jessie, because he loves to pick on people i have a old friend who&#39;s like that i&#39;m not friends with this person anymore because he loves to stir the pot, and Jessie doing the same thing to Yegs and everyone around him, how everyone didnt remember his ex Girl Friend from 2014 his GF left him back in 2016 or something like that she didnt want to put up with Jesse stirring the pot, just dont trust jessie because he will dig you a hole and throw you in it.

No Mcjuggernuggets we don&#39;t the real bullshit, we all signed on to your channel for your story telling abilities not the real life oh i&#39;m rich bullshit. Also in other news, Big shout out to Swift AKA Emily Saxton for coming out to the world, she will be a rising star, It&#39;s such a god damn shame that she has to go through this bullshit in her transition. I myself am guilty of making fun of trans people when I was in my teen years and in my adult years aka my 20&#39;s and going into my 30&#39;s I am ashamed of my actions as a teen. I used to make fun of gays, trans, and regretted it ever since. <br><br>I for one am a huge fan of Emily Saxton and I&#39;m damn proud of her for remaining strong, Mcjuggernuggets will regret his actions when he gets older.

its always ironic how often idubbz ges salty about dumb shit. Considering he is doing the shit he gets salty about lol.
As much as people shit talk keem, I love the dude, he is funny and entertaining. He is also pretty honest as well. And at least a good dude towards his friends. <br>Also the dynamic with him in this podcast is funny. <br>especially since nux acts like me when someone doesnt like me for little reason, so I just troll them.
keem is 100% right about the financial advice thing.<br>Even stock youtubers with out the intent of making money off of it, they just talk about stocks they always have to claim theyre not financial advisers,
The whole “making people whole” thing goes beyond just the money. I understand Akeem’s argument but simply giving the money back doesn’t cover the emotional and mental damages from the initial crime.
money can be the difference of you being judged by twelve or carried by six
glad i only found the rest of these people through muta, great flex on the corvettes. this is why i stay to my own and live in the woods
keem was pissed off the whole time lol. Nux almost made this man cry
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=57m55s"">57:55</a> I guess you could say it&#39;s a sign of the times
noi must correct Keem, James&quot;the fam&quot; is the biggest e-beggar online!!!
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=26m00s"">26:00</a> dam Muta stop beatin the keyboard likeu beatin yo dick!!!
Good to know Muta is a creep, degenerate and racist just like his best friend/guest, Keemstar.
The problem is not us being alive long enough to actually go into space, the problem is that in the universe existing billions of years another life form has to be alive in exactly this same 3000 years that we are alive to actually be able to meet. Considiring that 3000 years of the life of the whole universe is only like a split second the mathmatical changes already become pretty much 0. Add all the other uncertain factors to this and yeah your changes are pretty much -1000 <br>Nux_taku is right but for the wrong reasoning.
Nux X Keem
&quot;Accountability&quot; is something most people, like Logan can&#39;t do.
Keem thinks project veritas is a &quot;news organization&quot;..lmao
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=7m22s"">7:22</a> this is poor thinking. <br>AIM9X - 500k or so<br>The amount information they stopped it from getting by preventing it from leaving and coming back not to mention the U2 that was preventing it from sending or receiving signals. Furthermore by acting slowly and cautiously they hid just how quickly they can mobilize a counter offense during a real attack. - easily the cost of small country.<br><br>Knowledge and preventing the access of information is more valuable than anything in this world.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=6m05s"">6:05</a>
Devil&#39;s advocate: I don&#39;t think they can refund crypto Zoo victims right now due to the lawsuits freezing their assets.
Yall forgot to upload this one to Spotify
Aren&#39;t gravitational waves proven at this point?
Why are you giving this degenerate a platform to speak on?
Ordinary haha
we kinda don&#39;t know if aliens exist because our testgroup is just us, we have no idea what weird loopholes we went through to grow conscious
We know that people have gravity. It’s been measured.
Keems ego is fragile.
There is really no need to engineer a net device. Just a helicopter with a net.

Great 👍🏻 video nice 👍🏻 hype!!!!!!!!!!!

me nd my lil bro like when we was 8 or 9, outside having fun, seen this weird aircraft just in the sky, never got a good look buh after we both saw it, it just dashed outta sight. we told our fam nd didnt believe us. still to dis day we talk about it wandering wtf it was. cant say it was aliens buh like how can it not be lmao.  it was bout 15 years ago too
Why is this not on Spotify
God, keem Star reminds me so much of dudes I met in my early 20s that confidently attempted to explain something with a half assed understanding of the concept
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=46m22s"">46:22</a> Making the law so that you don&#39;t get punished when you give stuff back after stealing wont work; What will happen is people will feel like they can try to steal and have a way out when they get caught. That is why you get punished for stealing, even if you give it all back, to discourage stealing in the first place and so people won&#39;t abuse a get out of jail card to see if they can get away with it.
There are white holes too so maybe there is an other side
I get that the podcast is a place to talk out of your butt, but the conspiracy theories from both Nux and Keem gave me bit of aneurysm. The knowledge for that kind of stuff is free and always available, just do some research guys...
Keem has such an interesting way of thinking. I honestly think he would watch Ancient Aliens and believe every word they say.
Get Sneako on lmao
“Mizkif or whatever his name is” 🤣🤣
Aw man what happened to oompa
keemstar, so yandere.
I love how Keem is officially a bussy boi. He is actually weirdly wholsome, like his relationship with Nux.<br>Finest podcast 👏
Wait is keem a certified bussy boy now?
Keem did not make the whole thing through. I do a crime. Get caught. Pay it back. I&#39;m good. So I&#39;ll just do that until I get away with it, and I am gucci<br><br>Edit. Never mind, I&#39;ve listened more. He is just not very bright
With the AI and deep fakes, I’m starting to think Project Blue Beam seems a bit more plausible.
I think Oomp gonna leave this podcast <br>Don&#39;t Hate me<br>he&#39;s the only one that&#39;s always not in some episode
Keem said he&#39;s taking his gf to get her license? Lol
Crazy how one man be saying things without no proof, another guy is just sitting there watching to moderate, and one other guy is trying to get that original guy to give proof to his arguments. But in the end that original guy can’t see any of this and everything flies over his head.
When you tell someone &quot;no no no we arent friends&quot; Thats when you actually mean &quot;We arent friends but i care for you like a friend would cus i find you annoying&quot;
Nux: So you see, Keemstar and I are actually homies. <br><br>Keem: Absolutely not Nux.",PT1H30M57S,0.8959

Hila is fucking hilarious
Cant wait to report your death 👍-Keemstar
That lady has huge teeth
The closeup of Keem blew my mind. I thought he had pink hair. But no, he just wears a twinky looking headscarf.
i didnt even realize keemstar was still alive!  I figured he retired at least, havnt heard his name in a year.
I enjoy the keemstar cringe stuff so much, the last one at adin&#39;s place was GOLD
Keem is a clear picture of why mental health support and education (particularly emotional education) is so pitiful.
Who are you everything I see is revolved around him?
i just wanna make it clear that i am NOT advocating for anything of the sort, but how does someone like Keemstar not end up in an extremely suicidal mental state from his public perception? i get that the money he makes can wipe away his tears but when youre basically the official laughningstock of the internet how do you not let it show that it gets to you? im impressed by his resilience, honestly. if i had his reputation, i dont know if i would be laughing and smiling nearly as much as he is.
If he f up someone&#39;s life for a 2 year age gap, why don&#39;t you just do the same to him as well?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRn38sH5VmQ&amp;t=19m19s"">19:19</a> aww Baby Ethan doesn&#39;t like his yuppies talking back look at him tic when they call him out lol
these Clowns Praise R-Kelly and laugh about what he did but marble mouth and fumbles are Supposedly offended by Andrew tate and his allegations....
you know what’s crazy about the whole callmecarson situation? all his friends dropped him and started making vids and streaming with James Charles who’s even WORSE
People like this actually exist
my brain hurts 💀 but Thank you for explaining what he’s saying after he says it he was bein kinda confusing 🤣
The reaching in this podcast is crazy
Now, I&#39;m not saying Keemstar killed somebody ..... but his words and actions did aid in someing terrible..... ...
You&#39;re still talking shlt about another grown man, but don&#39;t have the balls to fight him in a boxing ring...you&#39;re the epitome of a manchild
Dude was a grown ass man at 20 years old the day his girlfriend was born, he should change his branding to TRAUMAALERT.
Why does it take 23 mins to watch a 5 minute video
What&#39;s the clip of r kelly singing here?
I dont like keemstar, but to be fair if they are both adults who cares.
Kringestar
Ethan is was cringier than Keem.
Keem is so insecure about is age he has to date miners now. Next thing we’re gonna hear is that he dyes is beard.
I mean it’s unconventional I suppose but as long as it’s 2 consenting adults
Hila is looking good. Also yes it&#39;s weird Keem is dating a 20 year old but it is legal. Who is the one that is talking to Keem in the podcast?
“People can call you weird for dating your wife right?” Keemstar wisdom <br>Wtf? I think the point of Papa Guts comment flew 32,000 feet over his head.
AAAAAHHHHH Hila’s hair!!! I love it. And yeah Keemstar sucks but also HILA’S HAIR IS BEAUTIFUL!!
Ethan analyzing keemstars room is a little weird
Disliked not for the content I don&#39;t care what these two end up doing. I disliked it because of the negativity and dark energy emanating from Ethan , it made me feel physically ill. The energy in this is so ikky, do better people.
Ethan and Keem drama is like 2 uncool old weird guys screaming &quot;im cooler, look he has erm done this&quot; and &quot;No you are more uncool, see, see&quot; <br>😆 Epic!
Hila&#39;s hair on point
Ethan and papa gut should be the new frenemies.
Who is this dude and how many chins does he have? 3?
Hila is so beautiful
Hilas&#39;s glow is gone
Hila looks like one of them insane tree hugging people not gonna lie 😂
Anyone in Hollywood is creepy. I wouldn’t trust any of you cradle robbers. Matter of fact 96% of Californians are child Chester’s. If your talking smack about another neighbor in Cali, it’s just one pervert talking about another. People in the East know what’s going on in these parts. It’s impossible to leave your child unattended in California. There will be producers, podcasters, YouTubers, movie stars, catholic priest, police, governors and the lust I mean list continues trying to assault your kids. 🖕🏻😙🖕🏻 you perverts. I think they all take notes from Disney.
Keemstar the worst
There is actually zero defense for keem, it’s kinda fucking crazy
Ethan ur at the stage of judging the dudes bed lol
Keemstar has permanent cocaine psychosis
Lol Your Face Is Definiton of Cringe XD - SAVAGE!
With the keem thing is that it&#39;s legal..it&#39;s weird and grosses me out personally
I hate Keemstar just as much as every other sane person but he is reaching making fun of someone for blankets on the bed and water, Xbox controller. All that might be the most normal thing when it comes to Keem. When you reach and judge a unmade bed it makes you look petty af.<br>Edit: Did Ethan say 15 at one point. Wow that&#39;s just a lie he shouldn&#39;t do that. That&#39;s not funny it&#39;s way different than 20.
Keemstar selling coke: &quot;Where you see a felony, I see a business venture.&quot;

So, I live in Austin, and I don&#39;t have many friends, but my brother told me that a lot of his friends have been hit by cars in the bike lane. So, maybe they need to make the bike lane bigger, or/and (maybe) people that ride in the bike Lanes need to stop disrespecting the fact that people in a car might accidentally hit you and it would be very detrimental to you actually living. I mean, seriously, you don&#39;t have the right-of-way just because you&#39;re on a bike. And I&#39;m pretty sure that someone in a car does not want to hit you. Get the fuck out of the way. To me it&#39;s very simple and also stupid. Get the fuck out of the way. If I was riding down the road on a bike I would not get in a car&#39;s way because I think they owe me anything. And even if they did owe me something it doesn&#39;t matter. Because, I can still get possibly hit. Stay your ass on the other side and stop trying to disrespect drivers that could possibly hurt you. The people who are driving down the road are not doing it on purpose. They&#39;re trying to get where they need to go and you&#39;re getting in their mother fucking way.
I really like Brantley. I think she is so funny and she&#39;s really smart imo. I also think Keem seems so much happier with her around.
does she lick your bald head when cameras are off?
How bad does Xylie smell?
So the show that got taken down isn’t going back up?
This is supposed to be a podcast?😂😂
Brantley&#39;s jacket is SO cool!
That bandana bro, just drop it
Wait...Diet Caffiene free Redbar??

I really love Brantley , she has such positive vibes and she’s awesome. Not enough appreciation for her I feel party🎉😊
Salvo made this show unbearable. I’m glad he is gone
Time stamps needed.

Ethan is proof that fat shaming DOES work. He really started losing the weight when the whole internet started roasting his jabba the hut looking ass
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj98czkZB8M&amp;t=17m37s"">17:37</a> the claim that andrew tate was abusive to women was mislead by two women who were fired by Tate in 2015. They were bitter than tried to falsely accuse Tate of abuse and rape which literally was rejected by the police because the only thing they had was an audio file of Tate yelling saying to get out his house and get off his property… <br>The same people gotten on Vice news and was exposed just recently on the matter…
I’m sorry but is there proof of these girls having these said tattoos?

Was this whole Seth drama really about mean words? Or did he do something tangible? Tell me he did something serious and this isn’t a freaking keyboard war…
So he was talking crap about a minors appearance or tried to smash a minor? What exactly happened and is there receipts?
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna talk about me and noodle&#39;s xbox live adventures&quot; got me good🤣
Keem taking a slow drag from a cigarette listening to this shit is such a mood
Jesus I could barely make out what people were saying most of this video. I do believe context is important in most situations but I really can&#39;t think of any spin that can be put on saying the creepy shit to the underage people that&#39;s he&#39;s said. I understand it&#39;s an emotional thing getting accused of stuff but he really did come off as a sociopath. I&#39;ve only seen him in collabs  that he&#39;s doing it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPZ03ObBBHw&amp;t=23m15s"">23:15</a> with bigger YouTubers so maybe he doesn&#39;t get as aggressive when he needs their views and support but he definitely needs to collect himself. He&#39;ll sort of admit stuff than try and backtrack it and doesn&#39;t truelly seem sorry. Like that guy said at the end that Seth is only sorry he got caught. I know most communities have one of these youtubers at least but I&#39;m sure this community it seems that it probably runs a lot deeper. I don&#39;t like drama but I feel it&#39;s pretty important to know what happened if it includes predator behavior especially.
Bro thinks he’s Seth the protagonist
Illuminaughtii x Seth the programmer
Remember etika
I’ve only ever heard negative things about Keemstar, but watching this stream and seeing how he reacted was honestly hilarious to watch
This is just the BHD fallout all over again.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPZ03ObBBHw&amp;t=7m31s"">7:31</a> i could not avoid to laugh at that like how tf Seth doesnt get it man lmao
&quot;Its SA, im not a Pedo.&quot; <br><br>BOO THIS NEGRO 😂
Bro these two used to be that duo. This a damn shame.
Dang I&#39;ma need further context on this ... Sounds like a regular school house roast to me...

This is the biggest dumbest clusterfookk of a stream lmao
Listen, as a member of the counsel of assholes we do not claim Seth<br><br>Because we ain&#39;t out here grooming kids👌
I hope Seth comes out of this u got this bro 💜
“I grew up”<br>As he’s having a teenage meltdown
Seth needs to take some mushrooms and camp in the woods... Connect to his higher self and reflect.... I use to be a asshole like Seth as a kid and teenager... On coke and pills burning bridges everywhere I went.... But once I found acid and shrooms... It changed my life forever... I&#39;m still repenting for my sins... I never msg minors but I was an asshole to most of my friends.... I believe in you Seth... You can change....
Seth and swagkage are my favorite anime YouTubers.... Sad to see this shit....
Holy fuck this shits crazy and keem just chillin
Keems a horrible person so Its hilarious when he acts all high and mighty on his high horse calling other people out.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPZ03ObBBHw&amp;t=0m11s"">0:11</a> the way he just slips out his chair with that face says so much about his thoughts on this and Seth
Associate yourself with keem for clout? Ya yall deserve the drama 🤣
Noodles next. That motherfucker gotta go too.
Seth bout to go super saiyan from sheer rage lmao
Jesus Christ I know for a fact all these dudes are children (age doesn’t matter) simply based on the fact that none of them know how to shut the fuck up when others are talking. I can’t hear shit when 10 people are talking at the same time.<br><br>BTW arguing isn’t the same as fighting so stop saying you “fight” people when you don’t. Also Seth saying it wasn’t sexual harassment because it was a joke is delusional. Just because you meant it as a joke doesn’t mean it’s not harassment. You don’t get to dictate how other people feel or interpret things you say.
Vaping and smoking cigs is crazy
I want to slap everyone is this everyone who is a part of this stream are selling woof tickets it’s on site just saying hope I don’t cross paths with them Cuz. It’s on site.
Bro the noodles walmart thing is fucking hilarious
I remember before bringing him into my any debates that I&#39;ve been with but now I&#39;ll just bring him to scale on my future ped allegations
“I’m not like a Minecraft YouTuber” ironic
wtf is packgod doing there 💀
Unintelligible nonsense like 90% of the time 😆
One thing I can say that has a small percent of fault is people feeding into Seth or people like that being mean in general never lead to good people subbing and liking us like saying “hey keep it up try to beat your previous vid go even further with it” is basically what y’all sickos like stop liking vids like that
Terrible mfs do terrible things
Bro this was just to much there was way to many people you couldn&#39;t tell who was talking and they couldn&#39;t really understand the situation

It’s funny when white people get mad 😂😂😂😂
The shit talking was so funny bruh 😭💀

Whatever they said Seth did he did that shit.

I thought that this would just be another funny comedic twomad video but when it came to the Etika part, I genuinely think that Twomad is the realest streamer and or internet celebrity. He doesn&#39;t hide behind a fake persona like make himself into a brand, he speaks his mind when he wants. This and the Carson situation is where he gave the most correct opinion. Thank you Twomad

This is bs I’m sorry, and before anyone calls me a boomer I’ve been watching influencer boxing from the start. <br><br>But boxing is a lonely sport, this tag team gimmick is just ruining everything. Deen the great should be fighting walid. <br><br>SWARMZ, needs warm up fights to build his experience and his profile. Tom zinetti would have been the perfect fight.
The &quot;most competitive match&quot; is people  against opponents in different weight classes and let’s not talk about Deen almost dropping out because he wasn’t higher on the card 😂
hiw can you justify giving modeen a platform but not mizzy?
I haven&#39;t yet watched this video, but what I would do, is make it so that instead of being allowed to tag-in your teammate at any point in the fight, the teammates can only decide between one another who&#39;s going in the ring at the start of the every round (only they will know, and they can&#39;t change based on opposition), and then at the halfway point of the round, a buzzer goes off (not the bell), the timer momentarily freezes, and the referee steps in and asks if the fighters want to tag-in their teammate, then the teammates can either switch, or the current fighter has to stay in for the remainder of the round. Additionally, you could make it so that in order for a team to win, they either have to A. elimate BOTH opponents (not only one opponent like previously); B. have more teammates remaining than the other team; or C. win on points alone, providing nobody has been eliminated.
Literally haven&#39;t watched the vid yet. I just wanna put out there, I don&#39;t like keem. He&#39;s annoying and shouldn&#39;t be in this space. He&#39;s ego makes me want to neck myself
The battle of Magicians 😂
This WWE but with boxing lol .. LOVE IT .. this is here to stay like it or not and I love it …. Put me on the card
You guys are pushing it now sheesh what a joke
I hate the fact keemstar plays any role at all in this scene. Bro is a stain on everyone&#39;s reputation he works with
Two snakes in one promotion. It all makes sense.
Get me and 9 other regular non influencer people that want to be on a misfits boxing card and let us duke it out, so there’s only 2-4 of us left to be on the card. I promise l won’t let you down
The fact these two are running misits will be it&#39;s downfall
Keem and Happy Punch should not be surprised when they sign half the competition and they decide to fight each other.
They are trying to be a cross between ufc/wwe. Keemstar is gonna ruin this influencer boxing scene, the clown bringing the circus...🤡
I am so lost and confused on how this survivor tag plays out
Hear me out, Have Keemstar in an Actual Fight, with gloves on, Boxing someone XD
Introducing the two biggest ksi meat riders
keem should not be in this space at all hes literally a tapped guy😭😭
Not gonna lie, I can’t wait for this
What fans were asking for a Royal rumble???
I wanna see FPSRussia on a card!!
Rose and Kimbo last fought at 165 and you&#39;re putting them up against Deen and cray cray who are 135ers. Absolute stupidity, someone&#39;s going to get hurt badly and even if that doesn&#39;t happen this is still terrible matchmaking.
There&#39;s weight classes for a reason doing all this extra stuff is gonna be bad if something goes wrong
W
For tag team I think it should be that if you want to tag, you tell the ref rather than tagging in action. That’s how you stop moments of fighters turning around mid-fight
This card is really cool
4 rounds is not enough for this
Nothing but a gimmick. Should&#39;ve been Deen vs. Walid or Adam Saleh, or even Deen vs. Cra Cra as a 1v1 at the top of the card, instead you&#39;re going to sacrifice Deen in a silly tag team match that he just isn&#39;t going to win because he&#39;s fighting a couple of high level boxers that are 20-30 pounds heavier.
I&#39;m a Misfits and YouTube/Influencer boxing fan ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. It is incredible to see how it all started from KSI vs Joe Weller to Survivor tag-team and tag-team.
Wade was right😂
the thumbnail made me think keemstar was fighting and i got exited to see him get knocked out but then i realised he wasn&#39;t and know i am sad
Should’ve been deen and lil car cra vs Adam and walid. Why is keem tryna protect his boy
That&#39;s going to make wade crying
Love seeing keek involved in stuff
If ksi goes then maybe ksi and austin mcbroom Square up
I Cant Wait For Survivor Tag
Do they discuss the manipulation a fighter can do. A fighter can just stay in every round by tagging out last 5-10 seconds.
Boxing purists are crying right now
Honestly it’s not even about being a boxing purist, it’s about turning influencer boxing into WWE. WWE crazy events work because they are well choreographed and done by professionals, boxing is a real sport with real danger and these guys turn it into wrestling for the money with no concern over the dangers
Cx in the chat boys
lets go

I can already hear the purists seething 😂

When is this interview?
you need to make a spotify playlist you have fire tracks
I hope this turns out like Tiger King. In other words, Phil emailing from behind bars.
You can tell by the replies to positive comments about Wings that the internet loves nothing more than to keep people down. They don&#39;t want people like Wings to do better so they can have their content and somebody to laugh at and ridicule. In my opinion, if you make no attempt to change and keep doing things that give detractor channels content you&#39;re fair game. If you actually try and show you&#39;re trying to become a better person I respect it and don&#39;t agree with trying to keep somebody down. Wings here comes off like a different man and he&#39;s proving a lot of people wrong just by making it this far. I hope he does well and win or lose makes this a positive experience to grow from. Somebody like DSP will never change and will always be a joke. I feel no remorse for him.
He should&#39;ve tweeted about it after the interview if it&#39;s a family member. You know Phil is going to try his best to find out who it is and stop the interview.
I want them to Interview jasper
Keemstar and dsp are all ready working together. Thats what this is. Dents.
Needs to learn how to trim a beard . Patchy as hell and barely has anything already
This is misdirection to make sure Phil&#39;s too busy/freaked out to try and do anything else about the lolcast. Keemstar is too cagey to broadcast that he&#39;s &quot;going to&quot; interview anyone and give Phil a chance to stop it.
Love this. Phil is going to TILT..knowing he can&#39;t control this at all 😄😁😆
Dave gonna tell us today on the prestream he s gonna do the lolcow podcast with Keem 😂😂😂😂
Oic making a point about returning speaks volumes <br>U think???
The restraining order is coming!
Piggy&#39;s about to BUST
This is a really out there theory- but he took an extra day off last week. Is it possible he had to drive Kat to this interview with keem?
Oh my lord you know Keem paid them to consent to an interview. Money talks.
Doody…..you need to slow down
I think Keem is missing with him. But if he&#39;s serious, and If he pulls this interview off, he&#39;s the GOAT.
By-the-way duty I&#39;m from Connecticut. I am from New Britain which is hood as hell right next to Hartford which is Hood as hell and Phil claims to be from Bridgeport Connecticut which is also a hood. I can confirm to you Phil is not from Bridgeport. He is from the suburbs way far away from the suburbs far away. I  also worked at the GameStop where Phil would frequent most of his life when he lived in that area. He is a horrible human we had to cut him off because he abused every system that we had in the store.
Maybe I’m alone here, but Keem is losing any scrap of credit he may have had. Dude is coming off desperate as fuck, like cringe level at this point.
Pig roach 🐽🪳
Phil had a rough childhood, once he wasn&#39;t given a wolverine toy he demanded. 😂
I&#39;m dealing with mental health
Whats the point to interview Rambo or Leanna? They haven&quot;t been touch in ages, there is nothing to gain from that. Kat sister? She is an insane junkie who would spout drug induced nonsense. Everything about this sucks
This is what he gets for messing with a big youtuber who has money hahahahh Piggy does not think much.And after that his wife will leave him.Wanna bet?
Top 10 Worst DSP Moments 2023 is going to be GOAT.
Khet is playing Skyrim; slaying the big black dragon Tyronir. Every night.
So its to<br>Jenna<br>Panda lee<br>John/howard<br>Who else??? Is that his whole lineup of people he knows in his life? I would feel so bad if it was anyone else.
Cue in the mortal kombat voice.<br>FINISH HIM!
The gout is massively strong.
anyone can hear dsp saying something like NO he attacked MEEE!
This might be bait... but still piggy&#39;s gonna be sweating bullets wondering who in his family or &quot;friends&quot; spilled the beans. LMAO
Keems probably lying to keep the drama and talk fresh
My bet is on his loyal and loving son, JASPUH THE KHET. At long last, after playing the long game, Jasper will have his revenge, and has turned on Phyllis for trapping him indoors and declawing him.
Birds
To think all this couldve been avoided if Phil just kept his mouth shut about other content creators. All because he couldnt contain his toxic jealousy in check
Imagine if it&#39;s Kat and she confirms the divorce arc
Hopefully this is linked to Keem&#39;s desire to get a documentary on Netflix. Hi-larious.
He wouldn&#39;t have to bail Jenna out, there are visitations in prison.  Just throw 20 bucks into her commissary account and she&#39;s good
I love keem so much for this. I hope he gives the family and friends the 50k. That would be the ultimate f u
It&#39;d be hilarious if it was Khet. She needs the money to get her own place.
Good. Have a babbling, on-demand, podcast speculating about Phail. He does it about everything else.
We all know his entire day off is going to be him calling all his friends and family and telling them not to talk to Keemstar.
this content is alot better when you aren&#39;t involved.
To quote DSP himself: &quot;I love it! I LOVE IT!&quot;
Phil is about to go from level 1, to game over.
I know phill is a lol cow, but why do we all love keemstar now for? Bro has done disgusting things way worse things than phill, and speaking of that, phill ain&#39;t even that bad compared to the likes of wingsofredemption, never heard phill defend cp, or accuse anyone of having cp. Maybe I&#39;m just crazy though
It’s going to be Leanne and/or John Rambo. The amount of stories they’ll have hidden for so many years will be making pig boy sweat the gout out of his body.
Keem probably bailed Officer Sanders out, and maybe got Rambizi. I hope its Jenna because she spits fire.",PT1H31M8S,0.6572

I may hate Destiny, but Keem is a genuine piece of shit.
Its honestly sad etika died (obviously) but its even worse he never got to play tears of the kingdom

Thing is is when he gets older he&#39;s going to remember those two people he killed and never be able to say sorry on his own Deathbed
That&#39;s what Kanye did with Hitler and look you don&#39;t hear from him anymore and you still got killed and cloned
Great you&#39;re going to justify Hitler but say somebody saying n*<b>**</b> is worse than somebody killing somebody cuz that&#39;s what he did talk to people into killing their self but God forbid they say n*<b>**</b>
Are you kidding me I&#39;m saying a few races Comics is worse than ruining someone&#39;s Whole Life by calling them a pedophile this dude&#39;s weird
You realize what he said could ruin someone&#39;s life career and could make them commit suicide so f*** your sponsor
Kemstar and H3H3 deserve each other.
Keem deserves every ill thing he wanders into
Nah I killed 85 people. Two years ago I guess I’m relieved of all crimes
Keemstar is such an unlikable asswipe and the things he does to people should be taken seriously and not as internet &quot;drama&quot;. All things considered he is an actual fucking demon and his content is not funny by any means and ruins lives
RIP RSGLORYANDGOLD.. to the old man.. YAHOOOOO!!!
E-celebs like Keem and that Tizzy guy are lowlife scumbags. Just degenerate filth. Best ignored.
Keemstar needs to be in jail... wtf
Keemstar still has a voice in 2023...we are truly fucked.
Whilst I don&#39;t agree with attacking sponsors the problem isn&#39;t just 1 issue it&#39;s the millions of others that have piled up into a ball of toxicity making 1 or 2 mistakes by a racial slur or an unpopular opinion shouldn&#39;t be a big deal the problem with the internet isn&#39;t the few mistakes someone makes that creates a cancel culture behind that YouTuber/Celebrity it&#39;s the millions of other negative toxic things you do that cause this sort of response to be made that attacks a YouTuber/Celebrity that&#39;s what I think Ethan was trying to clarify but it came off much worse that now if you make 1 mistake you&#39;re cancelled which shouldn&#39;t be the case.
Honestly surprising he hasn&#39;t fucked with the wrong one yet and ended up Shot/stabbed/strangled/kidnapped/drowned/flayed/castrated. It&#39;s honestly a shock--- if i saw him i&#39;d have to fight the urge to.
Do you think he walks around with an armed escort when hes just doing his daily activities? Because I am pretty sure there are a ton of people who would punch this guy in the throat if they saw him on the street lol. Like no holding back, full on sky dive from 10 stories falcon punch levels.
RIP Tony RSGLORYANDGOLD
Biggest L take ever: don&#39;t pressure the sponsors of someone who literally committed defamation per se to falsely accuse some old man of being a pedophile. So self-serving. It&#39;s the 1st thing I&#39;d go after since it&#39;s clearly so effective.
the comments at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3qhgTSv07c&amp;t=10m30s"">10:30</a> was just a typical day call of duty back in the day
keemstar&#39;s smirk face...
When is keemstars next public event. Just asking for a friend. Looking for a good vantage point if you know what I&#39;m saying.
a person being able to this much full of hate is concerning. Sad thing is people feed the troll and his hatred. I believe he&#39;d be vanished from social media if no one give a shit about him
Imagine not feeling any guilt after getting someone killed
H3h3 is not the guy to make this video
you&#39;r so narrow minded sometimes
keem has always been a piece of shit but Ethan has also said that someone should bomb the stadium a politician was speaking at
The internet persona should be different from you, a real life you. Unless your sitting in front of a camera all day comenting on and discussing every word that anyone on anything that may be popular at the moment to get veiws ... In that case, your you , you have built that persona and it is you to everyone else.
I have lost brain cells watching this
Funny watching this video 3 years later and understanding how much a pos ethan klein is lol
Crazy how H3H3 basically became Keemstar now...
In the realm of virtual worlds, a legend was born,<br>A towering figure with a mane like a storm.<br>With fiery passion and an iron will,<br>Asmongold emerged, his destiny to fulfill.<br><br>In Azeroth&#39;s vast landscapes, he roamed free,<br>A champion of the Horde, a force to be seen.<br>His voice boomed like thunder, commanding respect,<br>As his words echoed through every server and sect.<br><br>With mighty hammer in hand, he battled the foes,<br>Defying the odds, vanquishing all that oppose.<br>From Molten Core&#39;s depths to Icecrown&#39;s frozen peak,<br>Asmongold&#39;s presence left rivals weak.<br><br>Yet it wasn&#39;t just prowess that made him renowned,<br>For his wisdom and humor, a true treasure he found.<br>From his lair of streaming, he shared tales untold,<br>Guiding his loyal followers, both young and old.<br><br>Through quests and adventures, he sparked laughter and cheer,<br>Creating a community, united, sincere.<br>In the taverns they gathered, his words they would hear,<br>Asmond&#39;s tavern, a place to find solace and cheer.<br><br>But beneath the bravado, a heart beating true,<br>A kind soul, empathetic, reaching out to the few.<br>His charity knew no bounds, extending a hand,<br>Helping those in need, spreading hope across the land.<br><br>As the years passed by, his legend would grow,<br>An icon of gaming, an inspiration to show,<br>That through passion and perseverance, dreams can take flight,<br>Asmongold, a beacon shining bright.<br><br>So raise a toast to the king of the stream,<br>Whose impact on gaming shall forever gleam.<br>Asmongold, a name etched in virtual gold,<br>A champion of gamers, forever bold.
as much as i dislike Ethan the spineless klein, Keem is just an idiot in his own right.
I made it 11 minutes in.  I despise Ethan and Keemstar about as much as possible.  This is just one huge mud-slinging contest as far as I&#39;m concerned.
RIP Tony
It’s funny how Ethan really did a 180 on the doxing stuff
Man this is disgusting, not even gonna finish the video :/
Keemstar has killed mutible persons! He is an pyschopath and an sadist. he takes joy of the persons he ruins. If some on finds Keemstar entertaining he is sadistic asshole himself.
we can have a conversation together asmon, our brain works the same !!!
The fact is that 99% of the ppl that stream on twitch and ppl that are on youtube have a mental problem....number 1 they are scared of society so they sit behind a computer all day....its like an insane asylum gave everyone that lives there a computer and a streaming platform now all of their sickness is out there for all to see and sometimes the ppl in the asylum go after each other....its all a crazy situation.
Its funny that bi*** boy dont have tha ba*** to do up against ppl that can fk him up....im not sure but lets see him try this sht on Charlie or pewd or beast.....im pretty sure they would god slap him back down to hell where this guy belongs.
It amazes me that keemstar is still not in prison
Keemstar is a slime of a human being
Asmong is THE eternal centrist dude, it&#39;s so cringe.

Oh my GOD this is so nostalgic. why were we so insane back then 😪
&quot;Cancel culture&quot; (in the form of drama and mobs of internet bigots that claim they&#39;re leftists but actually aren&#39;t) has ruined many a small, marginalized creator&#39;s platform. Some have even killed themselves! But they&#39;re all queer and/or POC and/or disabled, victims of punching across/down so the righties don&#39;t want to talk about them :)
&quot;we used to have a flourishing commentary community!&quot; keem everyone hated you back then too
Raciss and hobophobic
&quot;cancel culture&quot; is one of those things that the internet likes to pretend didn&#39;t exist before a decade ago because it didn&#39;t have a cool buzzword-y name attached to it. Back then it was called &quot;taking accountability for your actions&quot; and &quot;getting deplatformed because you said something a lot of people think is fucking stupid&quot;
Wow... Put a cheap pirate costume beard on Ben Shapiro and you&#39;ll get this guy&#39;s face.
I just wanted to say I love your videos so much :3
keemstar saying there&#39;s no commentary on YouTube shows how out of touch he is when that&#39;s half of YouTube it seems
Funny vid. Nice one man.
RACISS. HOBOPHOBIC.
Keemstar talking about hero&#39;s and villains is very interesting. I think you&#39;re exactly right. He&#39;s the villain.
I&#39;m so proud to say that this is the first time I&#39;ve ever heard Keemstar&#39;s voice.
seems like he&#39;s 55 or at least that out of touch.  he has given platform and attention. to all the worst people
Ngl Ur just like chris ray Gun
i thought the weed was a chip at first and got so confused when he started smoking it
Ethan’s drip in this video is <b>chef’s kiss</b> incredible
Raciss, hobophohic
Holy crap, he did that childish harassment disguised as “trolling” when he was 27?!
Cancel culture has been a thing since McCarthy’s red scare.
its like he thinks he hosts the tonight show
keemstar&#39;s beard looks like he glued another man&#39;s pubes to his face

ever since creamstar left, global warming stopped, multiple cures for cancer have been found, and homeless people all have jobs and homes
I don&#39;t understand if he started in 2009 then Jan 2022 is 13 years max, not 14 ... he had to be specific enough to point out that in January it will be 14 years but that Math is not working
Keemstar just misses the power he had. When youtube was less diverse he was the main source of info, and he had major control over the stream of information.
i think juilius ceasar was the first victim of cancel culture or maybe even jesus
I’d love to see you try standup. I can tell you’re a smartie :)
He&#39;s got a twinge of tucker Carlson in him. Idk if he tries to impersonate him but he has the same tone and it&#39;s annoying lol
Let’s hope Keemstar’s replacement is a leftist disguised as a republican, and Drama Alert slowly turns from just looking at internet drama to “A Marxist/Anarchist/Socialist/Communist/etc Analysis of [whatever the topic is]”
&quot;WHERE IS THE FUN!?&quot;<br><br>IDK rat bastard, your fun was yelling the N word at teens on CoD and calling &quot;just a prank bro&quot;. I don&#39;t know if most people actually liked that.<br>This is some strange Make YouTube Great Again feeling vibes in a time where the top content creators were just edgy for the sake of edgy shock value, wasn&#39;t a whole lot going on back then except you could say more slurs openly without getting in much trouble.<br><br>No idea what Keemstar considers fun, but whatever it is I hope we never arrive at it.
i don&#39;t know how to explain it but keemstar looks like a child that just chugged a glass of grape juice and got a ring around his lips
I kinda figured Ethan smoked weed. But I didn&#39;t expect him to do it on camera. +10 cool points.
me joining the rotation with ethan
Change the title of this video, keeps getting my hopes up :(
I found in amazing that people always complain about cancel culture then cite examples where they act like assholes and don&#39;t understand why people call them out for being racist, homophobic, transphobic etc. It&#39;s call society shaping what is acceptable.

I do agree with one point he made.  A good majority of the content coming out has tons of random corporations and brands.  I like that the creators are making money, so I&#39;m not complaining, but it changes art. It just does.
Can we take a moment to appreciate the effort ethan puts into his appearance 🤲🤲🙏🙏okay thank you &lt;3 &lt;3 you look great :D
Ethan the weed did not piss you off, it was watching keem and seeing that stupid ass fake jawline disguised by a beard
He just fucking smoked a joint at the beginning of a video, the BALLS on this man are massive
Is it just me or do other people hate keemstars beard? Idk what it is it just looks… dumb
Remember when Keemstar caused someone in a manic state kill themselves
ethan good

Ethan and his fanboys aren&#39;t realizing a key detail. The fact this doesn&#39;t jusy affect Keemstar. <br><br>Shit on that asshole all you want, but turning attacking sponsors into a weapon against people you don&#39;t like is fucking stupid and hirts everybody. Eddy&#39;s logic was incredibly flawed and idiotic. He was basically saying &quot;It doesn&#39;t affect the 99% and the 1% has other options for money so who gives a shit, despite most of that 1% depending on revenue from ads and sponsors, the former of which isn&#39;t reliable for edgier content.

ik this video i a bit old but I want to add a bit about Ethans comments on Walt Disney, as an avid fan of Walt Disney and critic of him as well. The Notorious racist/anti semite comments are far from true. What people know of Walt personally contradicts Ethan. If anything the thing he&#39;s most guilty of is micro management and being ignorant during a time which it was perfectly normal. I can go into depth about things like the song of the south movie which honestly was an honest failed attempt at understanding/portraying south/african american culture with good intentions. And the allegations about anti semitism have been debunked needlessly. The Disney corporation has many flaws and I don&#39;t fully agree with them dropping pewds, i love pewds. But the stretch/shitty argument Ethan made was such a fucking stretch I&#39;m surprised he isn&#39;t a self proclaimed yoga expert.
H3H3?<br>Pathetic
Bionic Pig had the worst takes I&#39;ve ever seen. He admitted that he went after his gfuel sponsorship. And yet he wasn&#39;t responsible? Ok.....make sense. No matter how many times I read that tweet it just reeks of pure stupidity.
Why the fuck does Boogie always have to make shit about himself lmao.
Keem had the best flavor tho
Don&#39;t trust the quartering he protected hitler 💀
Eddy Burback gave me aids from his comments.
Kavos has a clear bias
Guess I have to use code pewdiepie now 😔
I can’t believe how much of a hypocrite chad and kavos are
Yo someone hella blackmailing a higher up YouTube or Google head to get away with this. Probably holding URL hostage or something. I&#39;m going to use my super detective skills to add up it has something to do with all these content creators with low-key sketch content having a purple background and Corpse sounding exactly like Ice Poseidon the person in head of purple army cult. Pewdiepie and Ice hella sketch. Hitman , murder low-key Easter eggs all over the place. Dad , Poppy, etc all part of it. <br>Just like a map Illuminati has a key to all their codes.
Both hella lost subs lol HA
now i&#39;m sad why would he go after felix..... 🥺

Ethan is gonna get us fuuuuukedd up
Why is Turkey Tom Called Zaptie?
Log joe
Being a MISFITZ fan I’m angry keem has one of their stickers
ethan more like pokimane
Love to see comment cop defend Ethan now lmao
And the winner of the video is...<br><br>Nerd City, of course. They always win.
Most, if not all of Keemstar&#39;s fans know about his past. They don&#39;t give a shit because, well, he&#39;s entertaining. DramaAlert, Mom&#39;s Basement, Tournaments, etc. Who gives a shit what he&#39;s done?
Ooo yes loving hear these millionaire you tubers complaining that there money sources are getting targeted keem is shitty doesn’t deserve sponsors like YouTube was not supposed to be about this
Can someone please tell me why Keem hates discord
When all you have to defend yourself is a straw man and slippery slope fallacy
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgc8XcgwUx4&amp;t=20m29s"">20:29</a> cancel him
good bye g fuel hat you will be missed
I mean h3h3 never said &quot;Go AtTaCkE KeEmStAr SpOnSeR&quot; his fans did. He just critizied the godamn mug... Not saying h3h3 is a godamn angel he&#39;s messed up. But that godamn knome did mess up and gfuel saw that after h3h3 fans showed it. h3h3 was not the cause of gfuel dropping the knome... His fans did it
I don&#39;t understand that people think that sponsors don&#39;t have anything to with actions made by streamers, YouTubers our companies they are promoting their brand
Am I the only one who remembers that bashurverse was so close to killing him self because of Keemstar
Kavos is the older brother that thinks laughing makes his point more valid
I think shaming sponsors is, so bad because why do you get to decide what that brand decides to do with their money. Yeah sure keem’s an ass, but you shouldn’t be the ones deciding if he deserves money. Sponsors should be of limits, because it’s money, and you shouldn’t fuck with a creators source of income just ‘cause some petty drama. Sure keem probably has a lot of money, so it’s not too bad. It’s a big blow, but he’ll recover. Now imagine what would happen to a smaller creator, who doesn’t get much ad revenue. You might say “well that happen it just happened to keem don’t worry” but that’s not the case. If this shit keeps happening many large companies may decide to not sponsor YouTubers anymore, like the adpocolypse. Think of how easily they dropped keem, who was probably making them a bunch of money. If they can easily drop a huge YouTuber like that, who makes them a lot of money, who’s to say they can’t start dropping small YouTubers, who bring no where near as much money to the company as keem. Not to mention it might just ruin YouTubers, and drama. You can’t be a YouTuber, and not get into drama, it’s a fact, unless you make like toy reviews. So if the new precedent is just attacking sponsors over just some beef, that may cause a lot more gfuel keem situations, and that will fuck over many YouTubers. Sure this may not happen, but I really do not like what this could cause if this gets out of hand. Keem’s a cunt and deserves to be shit on, but still sponsor shaming isn’t good.
I love how everytime you read steejos tweet you call him cuck and not steejo lmfao
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgc8XcgwUx4&amp;t=14m51s"">14:51</a> &quot;cuck tweets out&quot;<br><br> i fucking died Lmao
Most of these guys act like Ethan directly went to G fuels head offices and slapped his phone down <b>playing Content Nuke</b> screaming &quot;DROP HIM NOW&quot;. Like shit maybe I&#39;m the dumbass here but I didn&#39;t think it was a direct attack on my first watch, I laughed at it honestly. Shouldn&#39;t the brands know anyways? Idk I&#39;m on the wall here but the tweets without proper context sound awful.
That moment when fucking Steejo jumps in, trying to add his non-law school 2 cents and of course white knighting his female forehead life partner: “S I L E N C E    S I M P! ! ! The men are speaking.”
Keem thinks he has power.  Just because you cant get the hint no one likes you doesnt mean you have power.  It means you dont know when to leave.
Why are people sooooo fucking [intentionally] ignorant? Why do these ”YouTubers” (all small, barely alive and irreverent channels) as well as alt-acct-Twitter-kids act like Ethan is claiming Keem KILLED Etika?! He was pointing out what a hypocrite and terrible person Keem is; His points regarding Etika were that K announced the hospitals he would be in, mocked his mental health, riled him up post-release of the hospital, after he had been missing for over 13hrs—keem cold-heartedly stated, “maybe he did off himself” (when he actually had) But even worse than all of that crap.. when Etika died, Keem has nerve to say they were HOMIES and he needed to MOURN. Ha!! HAHAHA <br><br>You’d have to be actually mentally handicapped to believe that they were “homies”. Everyone wants to be a homie once someone passes. Keem is such a pitiful little loser. 🤮 🤢
LOL &quot;Cuck tweets out...&quot; Im actually dead 💀💀💀
Can&#39;t joke about shit when you&#39;re popular cause a bunch of retards will get angry and ruin shit for everyone
Stay (Clap Emoji) Out (clap Emoji) Of (Clap Emoji) This (Clap Emoji) Boogie (Clap Emoji). <br><br>Not everything&#39;s about you guy. People are allowed to have things happen to them without you saying how it happened to you first.
God damnit I love Eddy burback but that take is hot shit full of more strawmen than a cornfield during 9/11",PT29M19S,-0.9957

I know a lot of people hate Keem but I truly believe he is one of the most important people on YouTube because of stuff like this
I think Side Scrollers and Keem should Colab more.
&quot;influencer&quot; boxing is a joke
Boogie has been losing subscribers for years, this seems like a lame attempt to try reverse that and get his name out there again.
Ill put in 1k for Craig V Adam
Pat Contri vs. Tommy Tallarico
Jeremy vs. Rich will be interesting. I don&#39;t know about Rich but Jeremy is a big dude.
Pat Contri vs. Ian
Pat Contri vs. Smash JT
5lotham vs. Darius Truxton is better than ReviewTech USA vs. The Quartering. 💯💯💯
We need to see real bad blood between two boxers in the next match, 5lotham vs. Darius Truxton!!!
5lotham vs. Darius Truxton in the next boxing match!
The boogie2988 and wings of redemption boxing match was absolutely terrible! Hopefully Keemstar can do better next time.
Craig vs. Angry Joe let&#39;s make it happen yo, also Arin (Game Grumps) vs. Jontron.  Now that&#39;s a super card right there I tell you hwhat.
shout out to Blabs Best Friend Keemstar !
i&#39;m jealous of them sometime i wish someone help me to be success too
Shoutouts to keemstar for doing this and getting those two to hopefully keep doing the work on their weight loss
You still got it Craig, I didn&#39;t expect to see Keem on,, then again he likes to talk... lol, but it shows how much ScrewAttack did for name recognition even today, and bravo to you for all that you do!
Myself personally I don&#39;t think just because you go into a ring to fight it&#39;s worthy of respect. It&#39;s actually pretty childish if you think it is

I just wish Marshy&#39;d would just show up and argue with Keemstar in person like they used to on Xbox Live.
it doesnt make sense for happy punch fighters not to fight. More then half the fighters of Misfits are happy punch fighters
Keem does not deserve any of this spotlight he’s one of the most vile creatures on YouTube
Keem da goat
6minutes and no rug pull... Well done Keem..
Keem is such a sausage its actually funny
Why does keem get respect i don’t understand !
Keemstar needs to get Kidbehindacamera in a boxing ring. Hes also from the time around when Keemstar started and when Wings and Boogie started too.
Keem is so cringe it’s unbareable
Come here to be a hater. I don&#39;t like Keem
Nobu is better than nandos
should&#39;ve asked keem if he&#39;ll fight alex, they&#39;ve got a long history
nandos really aint that great imo
fuck keem star. 40 year old man and acts like he’s 12.
The 🐐 at it again let&#39;s go Fred!
Gotta get me some Nanos 😂
Two  🤡 in one interview
Keem actually seems like a nice guy nowadays
One thing Americans need to understand... your food is not better its just full of chemicals like MSGs which trick you into thinking it&#39;s nice. Our food just doesn&#39;t have all those chemicals
Nando’s is so basic.
Why keeping this paparazzi grandpa relevant?
How does he even see with the brim of his hat AND his glasses over his eyes indoors
@Keemstar if you want good food, you need to go to EAST LONDON FOR GOOD FOOD. come to the asian ends where green street upton lane is, then you will have good food. central london, south london and north london have dead food, id rather have a sandwich when i go down them bits
its kinda weird that hes interviewing a racist lmao.
I haven&#39;t tried Nanoos WTF they couldn&#39;t of got a more skinny british guy could they.
Keemstar wants Deji to fail so bad, it ain&#39;t happening.
Keem thinks he’s so cool. “Woah move the mic, you keep touching my beard”<br>Calm down pal, your beard is longer than an Imam’s. Maybe you should shave it
I laughed when keemstar got pressured by everyone to make at vs papi 4 rounds

He needs help, he’s clinically insane. He just spat out buzzphrases and crap, then the “fans” nervously laughed

Nobody forgot what you did
If Keem is lying, they can sue him.
Keemstar, how does one define profit???  Not uncommon for charities to do this. Big difference between profits and all revenue or income.
...Pending all the Karens that have never given to charity to be the main ones moaning about it. Lol.
Nobody cares if it&#39;s not all going to charity. We just want to see the fights lmao
Keem is just trying to tear down other competitors like what he did with wade

No, the intellectually dishonest thing is not recognising Keemstar was doing what he does and making implications and accusatory questions that arise only because of the shit Keemstar was slinging in the first place. <br>It&#39;s like blaming that kid who got swatted for being shot for making a move that &quot;looked like going for a gun.&quot;<br><br><br>Edit: Jeeeesus fuck, he&#39;s bending over backwards to hold onto that bad take. Bruh, even if Keemstar wasn&#39;t even responsible for the catfish thing and just randomly this old guy who 99% of people only know about because of Keemstar... The take that Keemstar was &quot;just innocently making people aware that there&#39;s this other event&quot; is just a fundamentally bad take.
While I agree with asmon I mean he&#39;s pretty much my hero and he&#39;s pretty much correct most of the time. The only thing that bothers me is how did keemstar learn of the catfish unless the catfish ran back to him to tell him or maybe I&#39;m missing that part. Was the whole thing Public I mean if it was then Tony wouldn&#39;t have to tell the story right. So with that logic then the catfish did it to go to him and tell him about it or the catfish was him would make sense. Though if none of that&#39;s true and keem found out a different way and then approach the catfish for the story then keem can&#39;t fully be blamed but something tells me keem knew about it somehow.
I think someone actually has to be a complete fucking tool, to defend or support Keemstar in any way. That lunatic has proven a million times, that he&#39;s an untrustworthy scumbag.
Is it just me .. or does Keemstar&#39;s beard look fake and glued on O.o
Asmon&#39;s terrible takes on this are actually infuriating. For shame
i dont give a fuck who you are, if you claim to release only 100% legit news then say someone is a pedo without any proof thats giving people the reason to go ahead and attack the person without any research, THEY TRUST YOUR 100% LEGIT NEWS. idk why i need to explain this? Asmongold i do not agree with your take AT ALL
I never heard from Keemstar before (now i know why) but i am shocked he still has over 5 Million subs nowadays. I really wish him, he has a situation in life where he has to depend on others and they just spit him in his face and go.
This is like saying Hitler is not directly responsible for Holocaust because there&#39;s no proof linking him to it.
The must absurd part is that people get banned for most stupid shit, but Keem can literally do million time worse things constantly and nothing happens.
Good takes
Your kid wouldn&#39;t need to be special needs either to know it&#39;s a bad idea to have your kid on a live stream they could do anything like pull their pants down... it&#39;s just an oversight of not taking into account all the bad things that could happen
Woody&#39;s best take easy
Asmon, the issue isnt that you are wrong, you are focusing on the incorrect thing here I guess, you are right ofc Keem can say all the hate was not dependent on him but, the issue here is not that at all. The issue is, Keem knew the truth, Keem knew the old dude has already addressed this in the past and the girl was actually 25 and thus he wasnt a pedo. He knew that, but he still brought it up trying to decieve people and lay a different story, lets just be real man.<br>And also, lets be real, we are all here judging people objectively or not, instead of beating around the bush, just judge him.
Zack “let’s hear hitlers side” rawr lol
I know this is a old video (binge watch a lot of Asmongold&#39;s content) but he&#39;s wrong about suggesting the streamer should remove his autistic son from the stream in fear the kid will do something weird which will come back to bite him socially later on. <br><br>If you have a close family member with autism/asperger&#39;s, this isn&#39;t something you can hide from or minimise risk because a public incident is unavoidable. They will act out and embarrassing situations will happen, but you have to do the best you can to include them in all family activities without being ashamed. It&#39;s difficult, especially when you&#39;re younger, but ultimately it&#39;s better for them and you to get used to it instead of hiding them away. <br><br>That said, come down like a ton of brick on anyone who tries to pick on them. Way too many judgemental sobs out there.
He might not have caused it but he kept bringing it up like it was true
Woody is a great and loving father and he&#39;s even said in retrospect he should have foreseen something like that happening. His audience was extremely positive about it but outside audiences like keems had just begun really attacking him and at the time he thought it would be a safer environment for him to do some more wholesome family oriented content. Since then he&#39;s rarely featured Colin on his channel and doesn&#39;t talk about colins personal life as much. He keeps his children way more removed from the public after that. Woody has a great response video to keens response about this. He owns his accountability but also calls out the lies keem says
Why the fuck was he defending keem star this much. Like has he not been watching the videos?
On one hand, one could assume that Asmon is right, and Keem was only trying to point out that his story isn&#39;t the only reason the guy was getting hate.<br>In the other hand, this is Keem we&#39;re talking about, and to assume he had any other intent than to stir the pot is kinda intellectually dishonest; this is Keem&#39;s whole bag, over and over and over again. Let&#39;s not pretend it isn&#39;t.
Tony has since passed away, rest in peace my man.
Keem is a scum bag but I&#39;m tired of people pretending Ethan isnt also a pos.<br>Also h3h3 fans are cringe af.
R.I.P Tony you where a good man!
Ethan is a dumb dumb poopy pants.
Btw, everyone knows that Keemstar would never have a boxing match and the main reason is because he would have to do it without a hat or bandana.
Woody must hate his dog now, thanks to keemstar🤣🤣 fuckin dog
The problem of being fair is that the people he harms doesn&#39;t had justice for the BS keemstar says, he dont deserves any justice, he is just part of the trash of internet, he is just a channel of news like we have in TV and we need to have them accountable of the thing they say, you can&#39;t just &quot;inform&quot; everything you see as news because the cociety thinks that anyone who is acussed about anything, is guilty, just look what happened to JD, news and drama are BS
agreed, woody should have lock his kid in a room when live streaming with whole family. During that period, Woody should have told his autistic son that hes autistic and should not show up in the live stream or the public. in fact he shouldnt have acknowledge his embarrasing autistic son.
How was woody suppose to know that his kid was going to do that to his dog?  You can’t say that woody had no right to live stream because no one knew that was coming.  That is a piss poor take, dude
What the absolute horseshite is Asmon smoking in this video. Reaching like hes trying to climb the stars and gives keem every ounce of belief while shutting down anything that goes against him. Hes about to have an overdose.
Lmao when somone not in rs community know returnofwilderness is a pos sadly thats only the tip of the iceberg for that sack of shit
Honestly liked u for the longest time so don’t get the wrong idea when people tell u ur take on the special needs kid is bad. It’s no way a good take so at best it’s neutral with that said it can definitely come off as a bad take bc you telling a special needs kid they can’t be expressive or public on the internet without having a constant filter on them is a little degrading or at least put yourself in the shoes of the kid who would’ve had to live that non stop filtered childhood yk? It’s not like the kid even did anything that weird lol I remember doing some weird shit when I was little to get attention bc I didn’t know it was the wrong kind
What&#39;s wrong with touching a dog&#39;s dick?
Tony: They came to me telling me how bad they felt because of all the internet shit” <br><br>Asmon: Where does Keem fit into this
how the hell can this man stomach debating with 13yo twitter kids
The kid thing with the dog is sad. I have kids and dogs. They are impossible to watch every second of the day.
“I don’t watch exposed videos, I’m not a loser” <br><br><b>while watching an exposed video</b>
<b>Asmon is usually spot on but on the point of Keem saying Tony had separate issues that caused his further harassment is a News framing trick. He easily makes up something that isn&#39;t real or creditable but doesn&#39;t tell you anything and leaves you mind to draw the conclusion while also implying he is still a p word and absorbing and credibility as he didn&#39;t say WHAT happened. Likely the catfishing thing was some BS made up by people jumping on the initial harassment and adding false fuel to the false fire.</b>
Keem went after woodys kid but shadman draws one picture and he loses it
I get ur probably trying to be very careful with your wording maybe because u don&#39;t wanna just be a sheep and pile on or tryn to stay out of keems sights and not tryna deal with the smoke or ur being paid lmao. Forsure not the last one but u can&#39;t sit there and go back and forth on how it&#39;s keems fault or it&#39;s not. Uv seen the past videos and u were level headed but at some point u threw your hands up but with this it really seems like your tryn to defend him. I&#39;m betting that foo commissioned or directed that guy to catfish him and try and get him to say certain things and then changing certain things in the dms to make him seem like a pedo. You know it&#39;s wrong and u seem to try and say it&#39;s not his fault. Smh bro
yeah i gotta unsub you might be entertaining for a while but your actually kind of dumb when comes to intellectual conversations and making appropriate judgement calls on people. Saying an autistic kid jerked off a dog when you havent seen that your self is very offensive and then you go and say that old man getting trolled/catfished has nothing to do with Keemstar even tho the guy was never accused of anything until keem did, you try to make your self sound intelligent but in doing that anyone with common sense can see your full of shit. people that can actually have an intellectual conversation dont need to go the extra mile to make themselves sounds smart.
I wanna see Asmon box both the island boys
Not really… I mean in the UK and Canada you cannot instigate hate cause damages and then just walk away. You can be in serious legal jeopardy. In America you have the freedom to use your rights to oppress and abuse others. It should not be legal, to cast false blame to oppress, for oppressing others is not freedom it is tyranny. You know people used to have a moral compass. We need one to correct the chaos of our world.
Keemster is a sic fuck that will do anything say anything to get attention. He doesn&#39;t care as long as he gets attention clicks followers.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYGN7Sfcm6Q&amp;t=38m00s"">38:00</a> Counter point asmon, you should never ever put a kid with autism infront of a camera on the off chance they do something mockable?<br>Just because other people are shit doesnt mean you should have to hide yourself for fear of potential harassment.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYGN7Sfcm6Q&amp;t=11m17s"">11:17</a>  vs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYGN7Sfcm6Q&amp;t=23m02s"">23:02</a> is legit the most angry I&#39;ve ever been at asmon, it took you a LONG time man.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYGN7Sfcm6Q&amp;t=28m17s"">28:17</a> no. that clenches it for me. keemstar is to me a high functioning sociopath. Why? Self-awareness. A sociopath cannot survive long without being self aware of their sociopathy and acceptance of it, its what helps camouflage a sociopath within a social group. Once ones knows they are different and why, it becomes much easier to learn what are the absolute minimum social and moral corrections necessary to conceal the truth.<br><br>ps: i really think that invite for a fight is genuine, that sounds to me like a man who just NEEDS the hate h3h3 out of his body by any means necessary, even risking global humiliation just to nail the person they hate once in the face with all their might. I dig it.
Keemstar shouldnt have brought up the guy at all. In any context. Well, unless he wanted to apologize again for ruining his life, but thats not what happened. He brought him up because he knew it would fuck him over if he did, and he was vague about it because he knew that if so his fans would take the accusationary tone and run with it while he didnt have to look bad for doing so.
So people were getting all pissed off because you said there is no concrete proof between the catfish and Keemstar. But these same people absolutely despise Keemstar for making allegations without concrete proof....  I guess it&#39;s easier to point the finger at everybody else except yourself.
Ok, let me simplify this for you: if Keem has any responsibility towards the harassment the old man got, then he also has responsibility towards this harassment… there shouldn’t be much to distinguish here, as they were both done and made with the knowledge Keem had alleged, otherwise they wouldn’t have 1.) heard of them, 2.) cared about them, and 3.) felt the need to catfish someone unless they were told by media that ACTUALLY CLAIMS TO BE NEWS that they were in fact a p word.",PT44M33S,-0.9921

"DSP Emergency Video, Thinking About Putting a Restraining Order on Keemstar, Asks Internet's Help",,17503,700,759,2023-05-08T05:57:44Z,"&quot;What&#39;s  that? Free money? No real strings attached? No thanks, <b>snort</b> loser!&quot;<br> - DSP more than likely, to an extent.
It&#39;s beyond hilarious to me, coming from an actual abuse survivor who HAS gone about in putting a peace order against the source of my trauma, how exactly Philly Phil can do so against a someone he&#39;s literally never met aside from through a screen, and who never did much of anything to him other than being a &quot;big meanie&quot; in &quot;trying to derail&quot; his landfill of a channel. Are you really turning 40, Phil? Or are you 4?
Little does Phil know I snitched to keem about the side scrollers podcast lmfao
Keem sent him flowers and that&#39;s a real sweet thing to do and Phil acts as if it was anthrax with his allergies and throws them in the garbage. Lol. I&#39;d be very touched if someone sent me flowers, regardless of if they made me sneeze or not.
Have heard Dave talk about this stuff for weeks, still have no idea if he wants to do it or not.
That other guy is an absolute prick though.
hes still trying to spin this shitty story of his
So there&#39;s still a chance????😂😂😂😂😂😂
The only reason why Phil said no to the lolcowcast is because he knows exactly that Keem won&#39;t allow him to control the narrative, and that Keem would expose him for all the stupid things he did over the years.<br>We know Phil is desperate for that money, I believe he&#39;d even fap a second time on live and divorce Khet just to get that sweet $50k
I have allergies! 😂 Come on dawg this guy is just too much!
This man has absolutely no radar for when he’s being trolled.
&quot;If anybody can get me this guy&#39;s information. I&#39;m seriously considering um, suing him.&quot;
Love the filter,it makes his face look less droopy.
Won’t take 50k but will take chocolates
Wasn&#39;t Keemstar about two seconds from retirement? Phil thought it would be safe to talk 💩 and decided to bring up his real feelings about the man when he thought he wouldn’t bother saying anything back... then he gets all salty when Keem pays attention to him like he was clearly asking for.
He doesn&#39;t realize that Keen is ficking with him.
So he is upset that someone responds when you insult them? Ya that’s what usually happens when you say something they say something back but of course Phil has to have the last word and completely change the plot and leaves out a lot of shit but the forever victim has to be the victim
Biggest crybaby ever
You know what’s worse than having Down syndrome? Being Phil
All of that was for Kat
And to think that all this &quot;lulcow pahdcast&quot; drama happened between him and Keemstar because he genuinely thought that Keem had the same time zones for the specific times that Phil told him to call, which if true, makes him look even worse LOL.
…this lolcow is really dumb
Nice Ron Pearlman filer
Phil needs to grow the f up sorry can’t watch the full video it’s great just this dude irritates the shit outta me and my brains cells die constantly. 😂
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL7xCMBYrrM&amp;t=10m51s"">10:51</a> EvilAJ vibes
We need to stop being so hard on Phil. Much more and he might just quit and we will lose the best lolcow ever.
When the warp filter hits him just right, he kinda looks like Markus Plier
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL7xCMBYrrM&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> funny how it always turns to gay shit when Dark wants to &quot;make fun&quot; of someone. Who the fuck comes up with fanfiction like this about someone they hate? He was so into telling this made-up story about how the gnome gave him gifts lmao Also, the moronic manchild doesn&#39;t know what stalking actually is, the Karen wants a cease and desist, not a retraining order. The reason is that every time he tweets Dave&#39;s name it shines a light on the pathetic existence that is Darksydephil which is the last thing the Steven Seagal cosplayer wants.
This is the definition of cutting your nose off to spite your face. Keemstar can keep his $50,000 I&#39;m not working with him. By the way guys if you could tip and become a member of the channel I got some bills coming up and I would really appreciate if you donated😂😂
Holy fucking shit this guy is delusional &quot;Following me around&quot; - He&#39;s tweeting about or at you. This is unreal hahahahaha
Phil&#39;s never looked better
Will &quot;throw out&quot; the flowers rather than give them to his wife, whom he proclaims to the heavens that he loves so much.<br><br>He&#39;ll eat those cookies and candy, tho.
It’s funny how he says he’s don’t with it, he’s not talking about it or this person ever again, and then next days talks about it again.
He has social anxiety. thats why he acts aggressive  in social encounters.
&quot;I feel like it&#39;s best for me...&quot; Piggyboy, the best thing for you would to just go get a job.
Live in an era where a “tweet” needs to be addressed. I don’t think we needed all this internet so quick.
That last snort
He&#39;s mad about flowers because his allergies💀
The crazy part is even if you dont like him you could still work with him. Plenty of mature adults do that in business. It&#39;s called a business relationship.
Look at little David acting like the tough boy again with little gay fanfic.<br>Where was this little tough boy in the sidescrollers. Why did tears form when things didn&#39;t go his way and why did he get all whiney when no one believed his little piece of paper.<br>Why did he go silent when keem showed up on the interview because we know tough guy here can talk hours about nothing.
Sorry to break it to you Phil you are a prime example of a lolcow and it is your only chance to have any success but you choose to scrape the bottom of the barrel and keep begging
Keem obviously lives rent free in his head.<br>It would be dope if keemstar had a valid reason to sue the pants off of him, just to give him something he deserves
Phil looks like Ron Perlman and Markiplier had a baby.
at this point keem doesn&#39;t even NEED to sign him on for the lolcow podcast, just sign up wings and boogie and have them mention phil and he&#39;d fill in the rest for free on his own channel LMAO!
low iq low self awareness combination
You can hear the ass mad for miles.
Keemstars influence is dying and he’s getting desperate. While I don’t like pig roach, I hate the teenage drama queen that is keemstar even more. It’s kinda funny to me that Keem got burnt by him <b>snort</b>
he keeps repeating Keemstar did not call him at the agreed times, thats how you know it is a LIE...
&quot;Invaded my privacy by calling at other times&quot;<br><br>This isn&#39;t an invasion of privacy. It&#39;s an inconvenience. And only for people who have actual shit to do, families to take care of, jobs to work, or other pressing matters. So, not DSP. Get on the phone you fat piece of shit.<br><br>&quot;He interjects himself into an interview I&#39;m having [...] has absolutely nothing to do with him&quot;<br><br>So, the drama surrounding DSP and Keem has nothing to do with Keem. Noted. The drama surrounding the business arrangement between DSP and Keem has nothing to do with Keem. The details of what happened, why, and in what order, between DSP and Keem, has nothing to do with Keem.<br><br>The sheer fucking stupidity on display here is baffling. PandaLee could come out of the woods and give details of how Phil was abusing her and his first reaction would be &quot;That&#39;s not true&quot; and &quot;It has nothing to do with her&quot;. Scholarly levels of fucking stupid, if any demonstration was actually needed.<br><br>&quot;Does KeemStar live rent free in my head? No. He won&#39;t stop talking about me&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t usually go off like this but...<br>This has to be the dumbest nigga I&#39;ve ever laid eyes on. He&#39;s the literal personification of the Tyler The Creator meme. My dude, just ignore him. Block him. Ban him from your chat. Move the fuck on. He&#39;s tweeting about you? Dear God, think of the Jaspers in the audience who are being directly negatively affected by some asshole with a pube bush on his chin typing on Twitter. Grow the fuck up. Jesus Christ. All these privacy options and, instead, DSP uploads a monetized video to make a shitty joke and say &quot;no keem i no like u &gt;:(&quot; as if this is going to accomplish anything more than propagating the drama.<br><br>Also, you ate his chocolates? Busted single moms in their late 30&#39;s have more backbone than you. That&#39;s fuckin&#39; pathetic. The bitch with the bowl cut, sweatpants, and uggs shouting at the barista at Starbucks is more of a fucking man than you. Goddamn dude.

Dsp doesn’t get as much hate as he deserves. He should honestly be in prison
Burst of may first, Phil wouldn’t be able to get a real job because any boss could find a video of him begging and he wouldn’t be hired
I love Fappening tales &amp; stories. Always hysterical picturing the Pig Roachs fat face. How does he have a wife?
Invite Lowteirgod instead of DSP onto the podcast. It would be amazing.
They got the same play time but DSP has been AFK the whole time lmao
I’ve never understood why DSP has an audience at all. Why would ANYBODY give him money?
Dsp is a moron who had it big. Blew all his money, fucked his taxes. And now is sitting on the razors edge of money, of which he constantly has to beg. All to keep himself from getting a real job.
that 100k would take care of dark for exactly one month, he would just be at the top of the wwe champions leaderboard<br><br>greed is like dsp&#39;s #1 motivator, his control freak nature just makes him pathologically incapable of accepting a payout if it means he can&#39;t properly manipulate 100% of his audience
He feels like he has power in his wrestling game guild.  That&#39;s why he is addicted.  He likes those numbers next to his name
Always interesting to see people who are only ankle deep in the DSP lore pool crack up at his shtick. Wade in a little further boys, it gets worse.
Keem doesn&#39;t seem to understand phil makes well over 100k/yr.
That was a funny azz video.  Thank-you for uploading it.
A finance dom streamer had me dying
Nah, Phil is addicted to his current life. He wants the power he holds over whales and those around him, there&#39;s a reason all of his friends have left and never even bothered talking to or about him ever again.<br><br>The tips are his way of assuring he is still in control.<br><br>Why reject consistent 50 grand then? He would have someone above him. Someone he can&#39;t de facto control. A boss would hold him accountable, he can&#39;t get away with everything, zero consequences, anymore.<br><br>He likely wanted to respond to John and Howard for years, he waited because they don&#39;t care about him or their internet stuff anymore so they won&#39;t answer. He is confident Leanna will just ignore him as well, the alcohol also doesn&#39;t help with his sense of hubris.
DSP begging confirmed addiction only 2nd to his addiction to WWE champions.
He didn&#39;t accept the 50k because he needs the consistent income. The man&#39;s a gambling addict, he&#39;d blow the 50k in a day.
&quot;Financial Dominance&quot; sums up DSP perfectly. It&#39;s almost some sort of kink for him.
This clip is glorious. 2 actual good YouTubers agreeing that this pigman is the objectively worst &amp; dumbest e-beggar alive ♿️🐷🤌🏻
Of course dsp is too proud to try something that could make him more money just stick to the hundreds of views on your videos 😂
Keemstar should have offered Panda Lee the $50K for an exclusive interview.
I never laugh this hard
If i had 200 views id be honored, cause u can have 2 and it can stay like that for months. I plan to get back into streaming for real. I used to just twitch stream new games just to show others what that new game is. But id love to make a little plan or format. I wanna be the creator most developers hate or fear while most gamers appreciate the honesty and lack of selling it. Maybe one day lol
Phil is soo lame Keemstar seems like a saint in comparison.
He needs a wake-up call. No spinning the truth, no flipping the script 180 degrees where he projects his faults onto others, no lying, no controlling the narrative. As long as he delusionally does that, he&#39;ll always be seen as a joke, a hypocrite and a liar. Because it&#39;s what he ultimately is. And people in this day and age hate scammers and liars.
It’s crazy how legit everyone on the internet knows dsp is a clown and a complete idiot but he still after this long can’t see it and won’t change
Ah fap gate. I&#39;m gonna go watch and laugh now
Having a bunch of money doesn&#39;t mean your life is fulfilled andcomplete. Man it&#39;s crazy how much people shove making money down your throat. Best things in life a free
Don’t forget lowtiergod
DSP loves doing the thing where he says &#39;I don&#39;t want to engage in the drama&#39; and immediately dives head first into mouthing off on everyone he can think of. He always has some stupid thing to say about everyone he supposedly doesn&#39;t watch.
I feel part of DSP&#39;s thing is as a narcissist he projects this image of himself he fashioned of this everyman underdog that&#39;s always down on his luck and kept down by these mean successful people which is unfair and him begging just feeds into that despite the fact he makes enough money and just is bad at spending it and can never take any responsibility for his actions. It&#39;s why he gets so defensive when anyone points out his flaws or holes in his character because he&#39;s scared once enough people see through the façade it all comes crashing down.
This is the most phenomenal Pigroach content I&#39;ve seen in YEARS. XD I love Nux and Muda. So this was hilarious seeing them dunk all over this loser. I&#39;ve become a big fan of Keem since his beef with Pig Man. He&#39;s funny.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z208qSsfcKs&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a><br>😂😂😂😂😂
Piggy got roasted by a fcking Vtuber bro hahahahaha, I&#39;m dying!!!!
These are all just factual statements. 
Yea Keem has a hard time explaining  it but dsp has created a safe space around himself that he will never leave. DSP has created an environment  where no one in his life can challenge what he says or does that he cant ban. When i say cant ban i mean he doesn&#39;t have a single friend in his real or online life after 20 years of gaming literally not one. He has no family members that he talks to besides his parents , who he speaks with only once a week if you believe what he says. He has blocked all forms of communication online besides his YouTube chat which he can ban anyone for any reason on or his email which is not a true person too person interaction. Going on a podcast with people like wings and boogie having keem as somewhat of a boss who he would have to interact with is all putting him in a position to have to deal with people that he cannot ban or block, which for dsp is unacceptable. DSP is an online hermit of which we might have never seen before, Hes a man thats only presence is entirely on the internet in a place where the only people that can interact with him have to not only pay him 100s to 1000s a month to do it, but they also have to be sure to not to  ever criticize or challenge anything he says.
Cant wait for phil to talk circles for 45 mins in response to this
AT <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z208qSsfcKs&amp;t=10m00s"">10:00</a> Keemstar almost nails it, what it is, is DSP keeping his delusion in tact. <br>It would shatter the shroud of delusion that he lives in.
I imagine DSP furiously gulping gin, seething while watching this.
He needs tho that begging he really does! to pay his gambling bills.
the lolcow podcast would have SAVED DSP&#39;s career.
I love Keems DSP impression
Kat is crying downstairs right now hearing the incident again.
I feel like if you gave DSP 100k it wouldnt even last a month
CANT WAIT FOR DPS TO RESPOND TO THIS, Cope is gonna be thru the roof!
🤣🤣🤣
the way Mutahar describes phil in the beginning is absolutely gold, a finn dom streamer lmfao. <br>“y’all better make this money go up”
I kinda wish that one guy would stfu

Keem really has put his sights on Phil God bless this Good Samaritan 🙏🏼💯
Have DSP heard about  The Streisand Effect ?  😂
Failed Ebeggar and Habitual Liar DSP telling others to stop watching another Content Creator because their content is terrible..... At this point, the pot has called the kettle black so many times the Pot is officially a racist.
For a guy who keeps telling us all to stop talking about Keem, he sure talks an awful lot about him.
😂Keem is gonna put DSP on FULL BLAST. ALL OVER the internet.<br>This is what happens when you go too far, phil.
Oooo I love the idea of divorce saga/keemstar funding kat&#39;s escape.
I’m honestly shocked this is going to be interesting
Looks like Phil bit more than he could chew, now everyone is waiting for the Keemdigestion. Glorious
If this happens, Phil is screwed! PERIOD!!!😂😂😂
The interview is Jasper he&#39;s pissed that his weekly $1000 PetSmart trip has been reduced to once a month cuz Hogan&#39;s are more important
Not at all a cult leader telling his subjects what to do
DSP is Ready to speak to the Manager
You have to enjoy internet justice Llve!
Also Wings isn’t even going through the “divorce saga” he’s actually going through something MUCH FUCKING WORSE , Wings said some dumb shit casually about Kelly going onto dates with “Zane” whoever the FUCK that is lolol. This is the cucked saga 😂😂😂💀
KEEMSTAR NEEDS TO GO TO SOME OF DSP’S BIGGEST FANS! 💯💯💯
What friends? 😂
Now imagine if Dave and Linda aren&#39;t aware of Phil&#39;s incident and Keem has to break it to them 🤣
This has got to be massive bait and I suspect it is, so sure we&#39;ll get some lovely salt over this.  If Keem comes through, this could be a great little arc.  I wait with anticipation.,
Wow he’s deluded, he only gets like ten fans compared to keeps millions lmao how can he tell anyone not to watch someone else
Keem can easily sue him for saying &quot;Stop watching keemstar!&quot; and it&#39;s going to be an easy win case. He literally threatens people with nasty attitude and that&#39;s against the free will. He behaves like a dictator and it&#39;s extremely inappropriate behaviors.
Kat wanted free of Pigler, but she needed the funds to make her escape?! This is it boys and girls! 😂
I hope they interview the helicopter company!
I can not WAIT!
Im actually really happy Jim finally fucked off, he became a shallow husk of himself and the stink of gunt guarding was ever present even after his tiff with the rage pig.
DSP is hitting the Gin, Door Dash and WWE Champions HARD tonight!
Maybe he read one of the comments I left and is reaching out to Leanna? Fingers crossed!
Phil &quot;Stop watching keem star&quot; <br>Chat &quot; Okay we&#39;ll just interview him&quot;
The writer’s strike isn’t stopping this series, they taking this chance to focus on before he became semi-popular on YouTube
Stop watching Keemstar
Is Scopely a friend? Might as well be at this point.
What we hope: its his parents or one of them. Cousin.      ,<br><br>What well probably get: jennas meth rambles.<br><br>Its going to be a show no matter what.
Not only did Phil not take 50k from this guy, he royally has fucked himself if this takes off.
Phil thinking his reach is more than the 1-3k views on the podcast lol. It would be hilarious if he interviewed a friend from his teenage years.",PT21M24S,0.9832

HOLY FUCK when bro said 09 they had asked him what time i said 09 bro i was in like 2nd or 3rd grade when killamemestar came into the scene

I sorry but there is literally never a justification for what he did. I don’t give a fuck what the culture is. Dude is despicable. PERIOD. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Shame on him and anyone justifying this. Smh
Why is that one dude dressed like Scott Steiner and wearing a mask pre covid? N sounds a lil like Howard Stern.
Is that dude Kwite? He sounds exactly like Kwite

Let’s be honest Alex was being one
gnome
I’m blessed that I was born right before the golden age of the internet to be able to see it (d)evolve and experience almost every single one of the major bits of internet history in real time. Makes me feel like I’m part of something
A bunch of white loser incels finding it funny to be racist.
Look Guys a gnome
There was a point in time where xbox 360 kicked ps3 ass but xbox stopped cyber bullying and that was gay
so after all this it wasnt even racist 🤣🤣🤣
I don’t understand why dudes chewing on a sock the whole interview
Can someone please send me the link to the origiano clip i cant find it :(
Never seen someone more full of themselves. Keem is just a real humble guy.... LOL.
&quot;So I was in a roasting group filled with racists and they were being racist, so why can&#39;t I be racist?&quot; Excuses
Double G Hard R clip lol epic legendary!
Fell off
I’m not defending everything Daniel has done, but Keem seems really cool when he speaks softly. After all my years of just brainlessly hating him, I gotta say; I would totally crack a beer with him.
We need a website like that again!
What’s the group channel
He is a gnome
Like if saying N-word is a bad thing.
Zoomers Ruined the Internet!
Why click bait

Alex is still a stupid...
The fact that my name is alex makes this video better :,)
So I’m guessing Alex is black?
Everyone got mad at keemstar for being racist but noone mentions how alex was being offensive to Italians too why do people have this mentality where you can say other slurs but the n word is off limits why arent they all equally as bad and before anyone says the n- word has history so does every other slur
What about beer guy?
He sounds so stupid with the mask on
I thought Alex was imalex at first
Any black guy who plays video games has survived the worst times from MW2 lobbies let’s be honest
Is that raccoon eggs?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GylJ_Yg13o&amp;t=9m06s"">9:06</a> is when he explains the n-word
Lol just watched a video abt someone trying to brand keem a racist for that and now I know why he did it…
Bro tell the other dude to take off the mask
This dude just bragged about doxxing an Xbox employee for doing their job and tried to dox them again. On top of shamelessly doing retail fraud. This dude deserves whatever downfall comes to him. P.o.s.",PT10M26S,-0.9976

Hi I am here in 2022
Keemstar is fake af!
Deji: Makes a video <br>Keemstar: OH MY GOD EVERYONE
EVERY news outlet (CNN, CBS news, Fox News, etc.) manipulates the truth into their narrative. It has been like that for years, and a lot of people still fall for it.
Bruh he literally runs a drama channel. He shouldn&#39;t be talking
I have suffered with mental health myself I am not weak I have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and physchois if you need to talk to someone deji let me know man

Honestly he’s a horrible human being n has no brain at all in who or wut to talk with people. Main reason I say it is cause he has been doing this shit since a decade or more
Ik this is old but Keemstar wasn&#39;t wrong lol, because if you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re wrong

Keemstar is literally the fucking cancer of this platform. He feeds off of you and takes everything you care about. But then sells it to children. <br>He’s a monster.

its always ironic how often idubbz ges salty about dumb shit. Considering he is doing the shit he gets salty about lol.
As much as people shit talk keem, I love the dude, he is funny and entertaining. He is also pretty honest as well. And at least a good dude towards his friends. <br>Also the dynamic with him in this podcast is funny. <br>especially since nux acts like me when someone doesnt like me for little reason, so I just troll them.
keem is 100% right about the financial advice thing.<br>Even stock youtubers with out the intent of making money off of it, they just talk about stocks they always have to claim theyre not financial advisers,
The whole “making people whole” thing goes beyond just the money. I understand Akeem’s argument but simply giving the money back doesn’t cover the emotional and mental damages from the initial crime.
money can be the difference of you being judged by twelve or carried by six
glad i only found the rest of these people through muta, great flex on the corvettes. this is why i stay to my own and live in the woods
keem was pissed off the whole time lol. Nux almost made this man cry
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=57m55s"">57:55</a> I guess you could say it&#39;s a sign of the times
noi must correct Keem, James&quot;the fam&quot; is the biggest e-beggar online!!!
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=26m00s"">26:00</a> dam Muta stop beatin the keyboard likeu beatin yo dick!!!
Good to know Muta is a creep, degenerate and racist just like his best friend/guest, Keemstar.
The problem is not us being alive long enough to actually go into space, the problem is that in the universe existing billions of years another life form has to be alive in exactly this same 3000 years that we are alive to actually be able to meet. Considiring that 3000 years of the life of the whole universe is only like a split second the mathmatical changes already become pretty much 0. Add all the other uncertain factors to this and yeah your changes are pretty much -1000 <br>Nux_taku is right but for the wrong reasoning.
Nux X Keem
&quot;Accountability&quot; is something most people, like Logan can&#39;t do.
Keem thinks project veritas is a &quot;news organization&quot;..lmao
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=7m22s"">7:22</a> this is poor thinking. <br>AIM9X - 500k or so<br>The amount information they stopped it from getting by preventing it from leaving and coming back not to mention the U2 that was preventing it from sending or receiving signals. Furthermore by acting slowly and cautiously they hid just how quickly they can mobilize a counter offense during a real attack. - easily the cost of small country.<br><br>Knowledge and preventing the access of information is more valuable than anything in this world.

Devil&#39;s advocate: I don&#39;t think they can refund crypto Zoo victims right now due to the lawsuits freezing their assets.

Aren&#39;t gravitational waves proven at this point?
Why are you giving this degenerate a platform to speak on?

we kinda don&#39;t know if aliens exist because our testgroup is just us, we have no idea what weird loopholes we went through to grow conscious
We know that people have gravity. It’s been measured.

me nd my lil bro like when we was 8 or 9, outside having fun, seen this weird aircraft just in the sky, never got a good look buh after we both saw it, it just dashed outta sight. we told our fam nd didnt believe us. still to dis day we talk about it wandering wtf it was. cant say it was aliens buh like how can it not be lmao.  it was bout 15 years ago too
Why is this not on Spotify
God, keem Star reminds me so much of dudes I met in my early 20s that confidently attempted to explain something with a half assed understanding of the concept
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UA7k8Kdja8&amp;t=46m22s"">46:22</a> Making the law so that you don&#39;t get punished when you give stuff back after stealing wont work; What will happen is people will feel like they can try to steal and have a way out when they get caught. That is why you get punished for stealing, even if you give it all back, to discourage stealing in the first place and so people won&#39;t abuse a get out of jail card to see if they can get away with it.
There are white holes too so maybe there is an other side
I get that the podcast is a place to talk out of your butt, but the conspiracy theories from both Nux and Keem gave me bit of aneurysm. The knowledge for that kind of stuff is free and always available, just do some research guys...
Keem has such an interesting way of thinking. I honestly think he would watch Ancient Aliens and believe every word they say.
Get Sneako on lmao
“Mizkif or whatever his name is” 🤣🤣
Aw man what happened to oompa
keemstar, so yandere.
I love how Keem is officially a bussy boi. He is actually weirdly wholsome, like his relationship with Nux.<br>Finest podcast 👏
Wait is keem a certified bussy boy now?
Keem did not make the whole thing through. I do a crime. Get caught. Pay it back. I&#39;m good. So I&#39;ll just do that until I get away with it, and I am gucci<br><br>Edit. Never mind, I&#39;ve listened more. He is just not very bright
With the AI and deep fakes, I’m starting to think Project Blue Beam seems a bit more plausible.
I think Oomp gonna leave this podcast <br>Don&#39;t Hate me<br>he&#39;s the only one that&#39;s always not in some episode
Keem said he&#39;s taking his gf to get her license? Lol
Crazy how one man be saying things without no proof, another guy is just sitting there watching to moderate, and one other guy is trying to get that original guy to give proof to his arguments. But in the end that original guy can’t see any of this and everything flies over his head.
When you tell someone &quot;no no no we arent friends&quot; Thats when you actually mean &quot;We arent friends but i care for you like a friend would cus i find you annoying&quot;

The DSP interview was captivating, seriously amazing. This show should expand into other parts of life. Kudos, you’ve gained a subscriber.
He&#39;ll NEVER admit the WWE thing, here&#39;s why:<br><br>He FALSELY OMMITTED THOSE EXPENSES FROM HIS BANKRUPTCY FILINGS....<br><br>This is a federal offense, since it&#39;s basically LYING TO THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY....<br><br>If he EVER admitted to that, one of his many TRACTORS, would go VROOM VROOM!!! To the IRS or whatever with that PROOF of FRAUDULENT BANKRUPTCY.... aaaaand he&#39;d go either to jail OR he&#39;d have to pay back his ENTIRE DEBT the claim erased within a VERY SHORT TIMESPAN.... it would utterly DESTROY HIM.
Holy shit is that stuttering craig?
Your handle is &quot;sidescrollerspodcast.&quot; Why isn&#39;t this on apple podcasts?
Y&#39;all should bring on It&#39;sAGundam HE LOVES talking non stop about DSP!!
truly a keemstar simping moment
Not even exaggerating. The best thing for DSP would to have a co-host or some sort of sidekick for his streams or regular events. It&#39;s the only kind of thing that would help him in the immediate sense beyond deep existential inner work.
Life has taught me 5 things:<br>1. You cannot fight mother nature<br>2. You cannot outrun death<br>3. You cannot build an empire in a day<br>4. You cannot divide infinity by infinity<br>5. You cannot reason with insanity (and Phil Burnell)<br><br>Unless Keem is willing to breach private info without consent, he will NEVER truly get what he wants from DSP.
From Screwattack to DSP living rent free in your mind. Who is the real loser again?
Holy grifter podcast
Imagine if Keem gets a hold of PandaLee...
You don&#39;t want DSP to succeed since he&#39;ll remain an entitled pos.<br><br>Only when he&#39;s at the rock bottom - he&#39;ll have to get a real job and rehabilitate his life, find a woman (or man) he really loves, and actually be happy.
Romance Kat
Wow
I used to be an ardent fan of DSPGaming, really admired Phil&#39;s passion and unique approach to his content. But over time, I couldn&#39;t help but notice a certain dissonance in his words and actions. The most glaring example was his consistent financial struggles, coupled with the seemingly extravagant expenditure on WWE Champions. I know he has claimed that it&#39;s not his account, but honestly, his refusal to take up Greg&#39;s offer to help validate this claim just raises more suspicions.<br><br>To hear him casually state that he spends &#39;under a thousand&#39; dollars on mobile games was nothing short of a slap in the face to those of us who supported him, and those who genuinely worry about his financial situation. Not to mention it&#39;s just not believable. The math doesn&#39;t add up, and it feels like an insult to our collective intelligence.<br><br>The Sidescrollers podcast, for me, was a tipping point. I&#39;ve stuck with Phil through thick and thin because despite everything, I believed he was not a bad person, just a tad misguided. I thought he was naive, living in a bubble, with a skewed perspective of the world. I even empathized with his struggle and respected his grind to earn his keep through daily streaming.<br><br>But when your lifestyle seems unsustainable, when you plead for monetary help while throwing money away on mobile games, it&#39;s not just naive, it&#39;s outright deceptive. It&#39;s this dishonesty that I can&#39;t stand. I wish it were different, but the lack of transparency and consistency has made me, a once loyal fan, a so-called &#39;detractor&#39; in his eyes.<br><br>My criticism is not aimed at tearing Phil down, but rather expressing my disappointment and hope that he would reflect on these matters. But, I know Phil would just look at me another detractor and that&#39;s why he&#39;s gonna be stuck like Keem said at level one.<br><br>So thank you Greg and Adam, for this podcast and for allowing space for these discussions. Yall are awesome.
Have you tried to reach out to John Rambo, Harold, or OJ? IDK if they&#39;d be down, but they know him better than anyone really.
What happend to Seth the Programer?😊
imagine if kat signed into keem interviews
I don&#39;t know why anyone would wish the best for Phil when he is such a terrible person.
You guys are really milking this one dry, huh? :P
I would kill for an opportunity to let someone take control to help me make money. Phil dont want that. hes gotta have control over everything. Sometimes in life you have to surrender control. I can see in the next 10 years he will still be on level 1 ill finally be on level two with my wife watching him as part of our routine. lolz
I really don&#39;t like keemstar but his last couple moves have made me laugh. I would be so thankful to him if he made a DSP expose documentary lol
He is just a weirdo...leave him alone
Phil didn’t even accept his own mother’s help for a honeymoon. What makes us think he’d ever accept help from anybody else besides those who don’t question him?
You guys should have brought up the 9k he claims was stolen from his account... on the show he said they didn&#39;t have access to his account.
Good luck contacting people he knows in real life. The guy is a complete shut-in who is scared of any kind of social interaction.
Years of being totally isolated within his stream chat has ruined him. That interview was probably the first time in years he&#39;s spoken to two other souls
DSP has always been an ungrateful, lying, narcissistic, stupid, and toxic e-begger. That&#39;s why people watch him, because he&#39;s such a dumb shameless POS. He&#39;s literally been making 80k a year to play dope games for a living. All he does is complain about how stupid the games are designed and lie about hardware issues (&quot;it&#39;s the lag!!!&quot;, &quot;I pushed the button!!&quot;). The problem with the games is really Phil&#39;s problem with everything... he puts in zero effort and will blame anything but himself. Why play a tutorial when you can just run through everything, know nothing about game mechanics,, and try to cheese every boss? He literally played dark souls for over an hour complaining &quot;the game didn&#39;t tell him what souls are for&quot; (it&#39;s an unskippable instruction at the beginning). This is a &quot;top creator&quot; that was still pointing a camera at his TV until like 2014. He&#39;s been getting handed bags of money to act like a petulant child, then he immediately lies about the money, and tries to guilt trip/scam his audience. I don&#39;t get all this &quot;we want to help him make more money and have a better career&quot;. He&#39;s put in next to no effort into his content, made 100&#39;s of thousands more than he&#39;s deserved, lied about all of it, and been staggeringly ungrateful. Fuck him.
He doesn&#39;t understand what networking is ,he said he would throw a dr disrespect shirt in the garbage,instead of trying to flip that opportunity
Dude I hate when outsiders come in then try to express empathy, cows dont deserve it.
DSP vs OnlyUseMeBlade
I got mixed feelings. I want the best for everyone. But at the same time, Wings and Boogie hasn&#39;t changed after the boxing match so why would I believe DSP will? If Phil just gonna use the money on gambling and continue to beg his fanbase for money then there&#39;s no point.
Phil has a crew of disabled peiple who give him all their disability checks
Before the interview, I had some hope that DSP would change; however, that ship has long sailed. The aftermath of the interview and his recent antics towards the audience and and detractors have made it clear that he will never change and is willing to double down to &quot;own&quot; the latter. I&#39;m just waiting for karma to come back at him with the receipts on hand.
There no need to look into this, he has a “learning disability”. There mystery solve. Because I have it too, and I see a lot of my self in my younger years in Phil. It took me along time to figure it out, but thank god I’m seeing a doctor for my issues and now I clearly see everything that I was doing and I feel embarrassed.
Keem, one sugestion: don&#39;t try to reach to him. Wait for him to reach you. Sooner or later, he will despair when his dents are gone. He has no shame, he will twist things somehow and actually reach you for help. Because I genuinly believe he would rather commit suicide than get a 9-5 job.
I don’t perceive a DSP documentary involving family and friends as being immoral.  <br><br>His name and face have willingly been made public knowledge for well over a decade. <br><br>He has had ample time and opportunity to ask those close to him to NOT speak to anyone about controversies in which he has been involved.<br><br>He also may have made fraudulent claims in regards to his bankruptcy which should always be something we strive to uncover.<br><br>I think there is an interest in the public good as far as the bankruptcy claims go in our legal system and false claims to his supporters who give him money based on his claims of being poor.
it&#39;s pretty simple if you pay attention. Clear him of debt and pay for his house lol
DSP is a compulsive liar. He probably can&#39;t tell half the time when he does it, because he lies like he needs to breathe. A compulsive liar is desperate for control, and interviews exposes him to a lack of control, which I&#39;m surprised he even thought this was going to go well for him.
serial lip licker
Okay hear me out....what if Keemster IS DSP and he&#39;s just wearing a fake beard and bandana?
I guarantee you Phil will get in the ring for 100k but he’s still too scared he probably thinks the audience will jump into the ring and beat him up because they’re detractors.
DSP is interesting because he is such a terrible person, but he is far too delusional to realize it.<br>He has ZERO reedeming qualities.<br>The only lolcow that you can&#39;t at least partly be rooting for them to be successful &amp; happy
Should have offered Phil a Gold Hogan rather than a Golden Ticket
Fuck augie, as if youtubers are a special kind of people that should be treated differently.
It&#39;s not a character. He is an outlier, an enigma who is enabled and supported by contrarians and wrong reasons. And it&#39;s ONLY him. He isn&#39;t supported because he puts out good content. He is supported literally because the supporters have an agenda to enable him to keep him there - and to keep the &quot;haters&quot; out. Both him and the fans have broken mentalities around control.
I genuinely think if Keem goes ahead fully then it will absolutely destroy DSP, he&#39;s been given soo many chances to change his ways but hasn&#39;t done it.
Oh Phil....
They have been taken by the vortex 😢😂😢<br><br>I think DSP is hiding something (other than bankruptcy fraud) and him getting out of his hugbox will open up the possibility he will reveal things he’s too damn ashamed of",PT10M15S,0.9965
Keemstar's new business pitch to DSP,"Keemstar was speaking as a guest on Sidescrollers Podcast, and he is not giving up on working with DSP. He offers another business pitch to DSP to do anything he wants. DSP should swallow his pride and accept, but since it's DSP, that will never happen.

Phil will do the usual complaining that he&#39;s obsessed with him and also streaming is a full time job dude he only sees his wife once a week and that&#39;s totally not his fault its not like he creates his own schedule
I recently got into the DSP lore through Gundam and some of his vids. I seriously couldn&#39;t believe how absolutely retarded his dents are to defend him and take his side like that while he calls them all fuckin idiots for telling him to just block keem and ignore him. They love sucking the pigroach cock, it&#39;s saddening. I hope the dents get help soon.
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that will change my opinion on dsp. Even if he wins a boxing match against kim jong un he will still be a toxic beggar in my eyes.
Is it true that Phil’s original channel might be caught in the crossfire of inactive YouTube channels possibly being nuked by YouTube?
Phil is not going to accept anything from keem. He’ll probably only accept an offer if he is really desperate and all out of options.
He won&#39;t do shit as he won&#39;t be able to leave his comfort zone of leeching from his dents
Phil has it made, and he actively goes against success.. while I can’t even get ppl to give me a view on a video. Ppl are begging Phil!!! DSP!!! THAT POS! BEGGING HIM TO TAKE THEIR MONEY, and work with them.. <br><br>Man.. hilarious <br><br>DSP never worked a hard day in his life, doesn’t put any effort into anything: <b>makes six figures</b> <br><br>I bust my ass working 12-14 hours, put in hours editing, and trying to build bridges, network, and supporting other detractors with memberships, superthanks, super chats, etc.. i can’t even  get a shoutout. Lmaooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aqua teal focusing in on the important things
If Keem could get Phil to random interviews on the street via late night show style that would be solid gold!
Hand outs are what you get from the government, a hand up is what you get from friends - <i>Clint Eastwood in Any Which Way You Can.</i><br><br><b>The only thing stopping DSP from saving his channel/life is DSP and his fcuking ego.</b>
Its insane how much chances DSP is getting, any other person would be abandoned and forgotten ASAP.
Dsp would need bodyguards. No way he would dare to go out were he could meet detractors or even worse, fans.
Here&#39;s an idea Keem, talk to Scopely about having some form of DSP special event in WWE Champions, where he can get some extra sweaty diamond Hogan JPEG, that might lure him out of his bubble...
I really don&#39;t like Phil.<br>But damn they seem to be obsessed by him at this point.
Won’t do it. DSPig has to protect his family?! Lol
I don&#39;t like how many chances that dirtbag is getting in life soley because of how pathetic he is. Like, do you know how many (more deserving) people would kill to get the kinds of opportunities that DSP is presented with?
Not going to happen! No, not going to happen!
Wow, I cannot believe Keem just threatened Phil and his family like that. 😮
Documentary?<br>Content Cop: DSP<br><b>cue the intro</b> ...
you can&#39;t help someone who doesn&#39;t want to help themselves
The pig won’t even listen to what Keem has said! Phil is the most stubborn and the stoopidest idiot that I have ever seen. Besides, he doesn’t need anyone to help him, he needs to pay for everything he has done throughout the years
phil literally believes he will get killed if he does a public appearance at like a convention
Like him or hate him, Keem at least is offering genuine advice. Too bad that advice is for the biggest, laziest, most irredeemable person I&#39;ve ever known.
Wings and to perhaps a lesser extent Boogie had their redemption arc and gained some respect even from their detractors. If DSP wasn&#39;t so fucking stubborn he could do it too, and it would be interesting to see tbh.
If Phil were smart, he shouldn&#39;t be avoiding this. 😅
Keem Phil love begging he never gonna accept your offer use it for better people like the detractor instead and Aqua your a legend 🙏
There’s no hope for dsp <br>Detractors allready control the rent free…..<br>Keem should check himself <br>There’s NO salvation NO redemption…<br>Only the end <br>That’s it
Every time Craig smiles I want to punch him. I want to punch DSP far less. Something about Craigs grift being accepted as &quot; anti phil&quot; is just more annoying cause he&#39;s at his core every bit as much a lazy grifter as DSP.
&gt;get out of comfort level<br><br>Aaaand you lost him.
Off topic but next video on my feed is titled &quot;They Fed Him To Pigs&quot; and I couldn&#39;t stop chuckling😂
I would not be surprised if DSP gets his ass kicked physically if he showed up anywhere in person, and if I think that then he&#39;s definitely thinking that.  He&#39;ll never do it.
Keem doesn’t understand that the detractors hold all the power here.
this is genuinely good advice which will be promptly discarded lmao why is keemstar still trying to help this man
It wont work. Keem havr to email this idea at dsp&#39;s business e-mail
It would be nice to see this work out. But the doubts are there with ego and resentments.
He wont do it. His rant about Keem when he went on Side scrollers was to vilify Keem in front of his viewers.<br><br>He <b>cant</b> say yes to Keem after that. His viewers will stop paying him, which is what he <b>doesn&#39;t</b> want.
Fill doesn’t deserve it
AKA: Mingle with people who are not your sycophants.
He can spin it however he wants. Even if Keemstar is full of shit, Phil has repeatedly turned down a 50K business offer in favor of aggressively begging to the denties. He is a black hole. Any donators should just throw their money onto a bonfire instead.
Piggy will sit on his invisible throne and trash talk Keem. Just make the documentary Keem.
Smart move by Keem to offer a truce, because that will put the ball in Phil&#39;s court, and we all know Phil will take the bait and give a toxic reply back, like, &quot;Keem&#39;s attacking me!&quot; And then Keem can say, &quot;hey I offered Phil a truce and he bit my hand again.&quot;
Dude….no more peace offerings just nail this piece of garbage with your interview
Craig and Keem teaming up to make DSP grow up.😂😂😂😂🤘
real derich in the chat or no?
DSP will look at this and say YOU&#39;RE WRONG. he HAS BEEN something different. YOU SEE HE CREATED A WHOLE NEW CHANNEL (Really, it was his old vlogging channel) And is doing MEANINGFUL REACTIONARY content, that is totally different, more ROBUST than his MEANINGFUL gameplay content. so why should he listen to you when you&#39;re wrong from the getgo.
“I don’t have time to do it I don’t have time to do it i don’t have time to do it”
I CANNOT WAIT for Keem&#39;s documentary.  I&#39;m willing to bet that 99% of what Phil said about his family and friends is false.
Keem and Craig need to understand piggy absolutely won&#39;t budge unless he&#39;s in control. His ego is too colossal to take orders from anyone. <br><br>Bless them for trying but it isn&#39;t going to work. Can&#39;t help someone that can&#39;t help themselves.

Wow Ethan’s changed, he’s calling pedo hunters sad and losers omg
I I can&#39;t believe it keemstars channel is dead now
This is kind of misleading. A.) Keemstar does not have direct control of his followers’ actions. B.) The whole point of bringing up Tony’s “catfish” story was never to claim that it was true or legitimate; he was simply saying that Keemstar is not the SOLE reason why he was receiving hate for it. Now, should Keem have retweeted the post that he did? No. But at least he was saying “I’m not the only reason why people troll you at all.”
Keenstar moving his hands JESSUS f***
Patrolling Twitter makes you wish for a nuclear winter
RIP Tony you were a aimless target for clout
Here after tony passed away
When you realize everyone is trying to make a profit off you. YouTube drama is lame. H3h3 I used to watch your videos and looked forward to every single new one you put out. Been years since the last one I’ve seen and had a recent clip of y’all present itself and the disappointment set in. I miss the way things use to be. I’m saddened by this but still the first video I’ve seen from this channel I hold it in m dresses
Keem is the father
So basically he disent post any good videos and when keemster points out that his new contet is shit he makes like 4 or 5 videos just shitting on keemster coz he is so offended when someone actually says the truth i respected h3h3 productions until he started posting garbage videos   he also dosent put much effort into his recent content therefore i now think he is a shitty youtuber my first reason for why he is a bad creator on the platform is bcz he has 6mil subs and copies other smaller creators and most of his videos are laughing at people who either make some dumb memes or some shit twitter posts
Just visiting the grave of my favorite youtube channel
RIP Tony 👑
He’s literally the mean girl in high school who can ruin somebody’s life with one social media post.
This was the final good take Ethan made
Good times
ngl probably a lotta actual attractive women now have a crush on this actual legend, lmao<br><br>(Not that i would know what it feels like ⚰️)
The voice of that guy that catfished tony... I don&#39;t know why, but I can almost hear his singular brain cell screaming out in dismay through his vocal cords, like, it&#39;s trapped in there and trying desperately to get a signal out so someone can save it.
Just proof that anyone can have kids and Keemstar will definitely fuck his kids up.
keemstar as president: if i don’t nuke everyone someone else will
Keemstar is a germ, can&#39;t stand the guy
If I had the choice between only saving one of two people and Keemstar was one of them I would literally rather pick anyone else.
And now tony has a brain tumour and might pass :(
h3h3 is hypocritical as hell but still, he made good points. there really isn’t any “good guy” in this story.
tony has brain cancer now : (
i was just watching part 2 and was thinking &quot;that would be so funny if he will go again against tony&quot;<br><br>it was not funny.
Man to see this video be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF-XOv6ajyY&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a> is FeelsGoodMan!
... Keemstar&#39;s channel is still alive? Wow. Bonkers.
TMZ has more credibility than this gnome fuck
Keemstar definately dyes his beard
Watch Tony&#39;s stream anyday and you&#39;ll sense the wholesomeness, that poor man.. He really is a sweet soul
I reported Keemstar, more should do it. He has no place here
H3H3 lost of his sponsors, I guess that’s karma
Boooooooooo hoooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Even leafy wouldnt do this to people in his hay day
We need more exposes on keemscum
Ethan vs Keemstar who will win the special Olympics
Now I’m not gonna tell everyone that keem secretly drinks alpaca semen. Keemstar, that is your story to tell
i would be absolutely fucking livid if someone came after my kid. i&#39;d throw the fuck down. god bless woody for being such a professional.
Coming back to this video it&#39;s actually insane that the guy who catfished Tony is so disconnected and fucked up that he could do what he did, then have the sheer audacity to tell someone else they should be ashamed. Idk who that is but they are a really really bad person who should probably consider getting some sort of help if they think it&#39;s normal to spend <b>a year</b> doing that.
I always thought keem star an h3h3 was related no cap
So did the old guy actually say that stuff to a girl that told him she was 16? It wouldn’t matter that he’s being catfished at that point.
keemstar wouldn’t be talking all that shit if he wasn’t behind a computer screen on his ass all the time
Ethan ya awesome
Has Keemstar stopped beating his wife and kids yet? I’ll let him answer that one since I’m such a nice guy.
The guy who catfished Tony sounds alot like returnofwilderness someone who has been scamming money on runescape for real money for years
Why not just drop Keem permanently? Chubby cunts like that make for very easy targets and juice boxes say &quot;do the right thing&quot;. Or is he just going to keep hiding, because his only weapon, words, doesn&#39;t make him impervious to steel?

I just watched the beginning and you guys did a good job at explaining the back story before getting into it. You all are doing great and thanks for keeping me entertained this evening 😝Have a happy day!
Swift will do anything to keep from working a normal job
They&#39;re just trying to stay relevant in 2022. Boring 👎
Honestly it was just a stupid joke, it was really unprofessional and inappropiate joke towards a member of the LGBTQ+ community, but that doesn&#39;t make Jesse transphobic. Americans just like taking everything offensive and boycotting the person who really didn&#39;t mean any harm.
I derfinitely though jessie owned storyfire he always said it before he left youtube supposedly
Today is the first time i ever heard about any of this, Ive just been under a rock for 8 months apparently.
There are cartel and terrorists brutally murdering civilians for clout, but these people are more worried about &quot;dead naming.&quot; America is pathetic.
How does Keem not fire his co-host? He’s a colossal asshole and not in an endearing way.
Kids dont need to see these transmissions
what ever happened to the boxing match??
don&#39;t over talk when keemstar
Salvo probably one of the worst humans ever 😂
You can get a much better co-host. One with any sort of brain.
Salvo is so freaking annoying get him outta here!!!!!🥴🥴🥴
So disingenuous to hear keem talk about this stuff like he’s supportive of it. He OBVIOUSLY doesnt agree with the trans movement. He’s just taking the opportunity to shit on Jesse
Emily is utterly pathetic
I cant stand the dude on the left and its making me not want to watch this.
The dude on the left is a child amd reading comments and playing into them.  Be yourself.  Dont be on a podcast
God that person in the green shirt is annoying its like stfu and take it serious...
im with jessie on this one😂
Keem’s Friend is such piece of crap that he makes Keem look good lmao
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTIn5CPIkXQ&amp;t=2h50m00s"">2:50:00</a> wtf
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTIn5CPIkXQ&amp;t=1h44m52s"">1:44:52</a> keem is dying of laughter 🤣🤣🤣 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTIn5CPIkXQ&amp;t=2h51m00s"">2:51:00</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTIn5CPIkXQ&amp;t=2h51m03s"">2:51:03</a> he’s like I’m out 🤣
Just fyi about the suicide percentages 82% of trans ppl have considered suicide and 40% have attempted
Glad keem the transphic racist has a real opinion
We all know keem and the other dude think swift is an annoying attention seeking weirdo
Jeff is lucky its not F@G keemstar roasting him
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTIn5CPIkXQ&amp;t=3m08s"">3:08</a> that shit got me dying 🤣
Swift isn&#39;t anything but a damn super annoying clown and an overgrown nuisance who&#39;s only doing this whole trans shit because he&#39;s desperate for clout, relevancy, and attention, and the same goes for all those other washed up, irrelevant, one-hit wonder YouTube circus rejects that tried making up shit about Jesse. Swift&#39;s a guy, plain and f-ing simple, he can play pretend princess, dress up, and put on all the make up he wants, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s never going to change how he came into this world.
Atleast this trans man has respect... what joke he laughed his ass off
24 hahaha u listen well it was 26 xD
Jesse definitely said the B word lmao
this podcast kept me alive. now its over
Swift that Peter Griffin laugh entertained nobody.
Keen again with the fake cringe laughing
i heard about this drama months ago and honestly i didnt put my take on it, Because people who support Jessie are cult followers because if Jessie tells them to jump off a bridge, I honestly think they would honestly,<br><br><br>Anyway going to put my take on this drama, i honestly think Jessie loves bullying Emily, and Jessie has been bullying @YegsTv on Yegs stream Jessie would go on yegs Minecraft worlds behind yegs back and destroys his stuff in the Minecraft worlds honestly, i would say to people if you get dms from Jessie asking you do you want to live with him and the stream house, say no because Jessie only cares about himself honestly, and if Yegs reads this you need to get out of Jessie&#39;s house while you can, because jessie going to pull you in to his stuff like he going to try to make you like him from 2015,<br><br><br>and honestly i think Jessie is the fakest person in the world, Jessie would take a piss out of people behind there backs to other youtubers, and honestly some people support jessie idk if they trolling by supporting him, but honestly people need to unsub to him honestly, Jessie is not Jessie he would laugh things off.<br><br><br>My bottom take of this is, Dont trust Jessie, because he loves to pick on people i have a old friend who&#39;s like that i&#39;m not friends with this person anymore because he loves to stir the pot, and Jessie doing the same thing to Yegs and everyone around him, how everyone didnt remember his ex Girl Friend from 2014 his GF left him back in 2016 or something like that she didnt want to put up with Jesse stirring the pot, just dont trust jessie because he will dig you a hole and throw you in it.

I love how Keem keeps saying  &quot;he transgendered&quot; instead of transition 🤣🤣
dude in the left with the faze hat was pissing me off the whole video thinking this is all a joke
No Mcjuggernuggets we don&#39;t the real bullshit, we all signed on to your channel for your story telling abilities not the real life oh i&#39;m rich bullshit. Also in other news, Big shout out to Swift AKA Emily Saxton for coming out to the world, she will be a rising star, It&#39;s such a god damn shame that she has to go through this bullshit in her transition. I myself am guilty of making fun of trans people when I was in my teen years and in my adult years aka my 20&#39;s and going into my 30&#39;s I am ashamed of my actions as a teen. I used to make fun of gays, trans, and regretted it ever since. <br><br>I for one am a huge fan of Emily Saxton and I&#39;m damn proud of her for remaining strong, Mcjuggernuggets will regret his actions when he gets older.

Emily I’m on your side I stand with LGBTQ family you have friend in me
Jess look like a chomo 4 real
Jesus these guys can’t read
You can tell theres still at least some respect between Keem and Jessie
You two need a English class, imagine your job being talking and you can’t do it properly 😂

It is great seeing someone have less subs than the person who&#39;s career they ruined. You know exactly what I&#39;m referring to, and I want you to take responsibility for your actions. What you did was unforgivable and robbed millions of people of years worth of great YouTube content. Idc if most people don&#39;t get to see this comment. It was aimed specifically towards you, and not your fans. Take responsibility and apologize for your actions you career ruining pos.
Dead channel, lol~
bruh keep uploading wtf
grow up old man and take your meds
It&#39;s your fault you ungrateful kid
Like as a 30+ year old man….tell me what you have in common with a 20 year old….
This is so gross I thought she was like his assistant or something like…..I hope that girl is ok. Gross he’s grooming her
🤮keem saying that body good he&#39;s that 90 year old creep that sits inna gas station hanging out watching lil girls like the old perv he os
Cuz keems a ped that meets highschool girls while he&#39;s drunk
Ethan&#39;s a attention ho instigator
Keems a ped
This guy crys about h3 making a video about him and calls him a pedo. Lol. Coming from a 40 year old who dates people half his age that&#39;s hilarious
we won’t forget what you did bro 🤦🏾‍♂️

You’re very quick to try and ruin peoples lives and careers. Yet u dont seem to care to fix what you instigated and destroyed. Keep being fed lies.
You Sir, are a ** hypocrite. A clout chaser. And quite small. In and out.
i will not forgive you keem.
3 months and only 18k views, sorry keem. Maybe you&#39;ll get more views when you grow up
No matter what you do or how many layers of time pass, you know you’re not valid for what you told him…
Meanwhile, Keemstar out here advocating for dating 16 yr olds. Brantley deserves better
I sent Ab screenshots of your profile. 🤣🤣🤣
todos lembramos sobre o que você fez, Keemstar.
Thank God he&#39;s not on twitch
Brantley you’re more than how you look it’s not live if you are just a living doll for him 😊
KEEMS A PEDO
Keen could get Brantley killed if she tries to leave him who knows how long he knew her before dating and she’s so young and looks so young help her
She’s afraid of keen help Brantley please
she admits that she is more mature then the men she is dating while him being literally 2x her age and nobody bats an eye? poor thing shes gonna look at this in 10 years and be like &quot;holy shit whats wrong with me&quot;
Keem you should have faded away into the darkness a long time ago.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
I love Brantley tbh she&#39;s so funny
I will never forget what you did

Girl we understand you had to grow up early because of a shitty parental situation. Don’t take out that trauma holding on to mommy and daddy issues going out with someone who’s old enough to be your dad.
I can’t with the button 😂😂😂 loser
How does keem have an unbelievably insightful 6 and a half hours deconstruction of a man&#39;s entire life with like a dozen guests and then also makes this video where he makes fun of a lady&#39;s appearance like he&#39;s leafy or something?
bro wtf hshe was ur asistant n now ur fuckin her n shes ur gf? bro prob paid for her braces too... we all know why
How does she sound more like a man than you do?

DSP goes on a tsundere rant about Keemstar,"After claiming to never talk about him again for the final time, DSP uploaded yet another SPECIAL VIDEO to complain about Keemstar (again), and he makes some very...interesting comments about Keemstar. Comments include making up a scenario where Keemstar sends him gifts, implying Keemstar wants to date him, calling Keemstar a stalker and threatening to get a retraining order on him. DSP IS MARRIED, STOOPID!

#dspgaming #keemstar #dsp #dspreacts #aquateal",3607,162,150,2023-05-08T14:00:17Z,"Honestly, the realest power move would be for Keem to actually send Phil chocolate and flowers now.
Dsp still not knowing how the internet work
He&#39;s really too stupid to understand Keem has no intention anymore of Dave being on a &#39;show&#39;, hes simply trolling him. Yet Dave is too stupid to get it and keeps falling for it. He just cannot ever shut up
The only person who I&#39;ve ever heard say &#39;chocolates&#39; is Dave. Why and how is he so weird. A decade+ of basically self imposed complete isolation has simply destroyed his mind
He wants to make it illegal to even talk about him on the internet, mature adult with a business degree btw
&quot;Why do I have to keep being in his mouth?&quot;
Keem spends 10sec on a tweet, DSP spends 10min responding. I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s more obsessed. Lol
I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s not wasting his time talking about keemstar anymore
Hey hey, have a break, have a keem kat. 😂
Phil is so tsun.
“It’s not like I care about you, baka!”
DSP: I want nothing to do with Keemstar<br>Also DSP: <b>rants about Keemstar for 10 minutes</b><br><br>I think Phil wants to be filled up with that Keem cream... maybe he can absorb some talent via osmosis in his colon?
Holy crap, is DSP turning into KingCobraJFS (Gothic King Poser)?
DSP is the Fakest Lolcow to ever exist. Everything he says or does to try and seem &quot;cool&quot; or relevant is clearly forced. The only things that are genuine about him are his Ebegs, and his King of Hate persona because that is DSP in a nutshell.
Idk a lot about keemstar, what&#39;s up with the Keebler thing from Dave here?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvVQa4YLiRM&amp;t=1m07s"">1:07</a> It should say a lot that DSP is STILL USING the Low Hanging Fruit Insult towards Keemstar about his Height.<br><br>And to my Knowledge I don&#39;t think Keemstar has even hit below the Belt on Phil with the PandaLee Pedo Card, or the Fappening Once. It&#39;s all been how Dave has been acting giving Keem the runaround and pointing out how stupid he looks.<br><br>Dave&#39;s Not Fooling anyone.
Normal Guys: You weird ass gay mofo.<br><br>DarksydePhil: Well....Sure the Flowers and Chocolates were good but. I&#39;m still not going to take your offer.
He wants a restraining order on a person he has never met.  Unbelievable.
By the way, I am married! My wife, kat, agrees with me by the way.
It&#39;s not like Phil is getting charged or anything. Just take the candy and be happy for once you swine.
Why is half of this video Phil joking about eating Keemstar’s ass?
Keem might need to contact a lawyer, Phil is obsessing and unhinged
Rent free philip, rent free
I love how hes trying to make fun of Keem’s appearance with the whole elf thing like idubbbz did. Except Ian was far more eloquent about it, Phil on the other hand cant even get anyone to chuckle
Phil does not get it. He&#39;s too dumb.<br><br>All KEEM has to do is spend 2 minutes to make a tweet, and Phil has to waste 30 minutes of his life to cope over it.
I dont think dsp knows what a restraining order is
He was so close to sound like Will &quot;Cuck&quot; Smith by telling Keem star to leave his name out of his mouth. He almost just said that and reveled cuckery that is himself.
Imagine being so bitch made, that you&#39;re scared of a man who&#39;s beard is taller than he is..
DSP is so unfunny when he&#39;s trying to be. This is super cringe
This is the one of the best dsp sagas
The dude wants to give him 50g but in daves head it&#39;s stalking.
Yandere DSP is so possessive of his fans.
Phil is descending into madness after the interview (or maybe after Charlie made a video about him). 2023 isn&#39;t even halfway done and there already so many L moments this year 😂
One tweet is all it takes for another six minutes of rambling.  He&#39;ll always rise to the bait.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvVQa4YLiRM&amp;t=5m53s"">5:53</a> If that&#39;s what he considers to be &#39;washing his hands&#39;, no wonder the Snort Fort is in such a shambles. Someone tell PETA that it&#39;s not a healthy environment for a cat and a horse.
This entire coping session of his has been just... fantastic.
never talking about keemstar again btw.<br><br>also seriously is dsp a closeted homosexual?
He needs to have the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvVQa4YLiRM&amp;t=1m50s"">1:50</a> talk with OIC :)
Damn keemstar got owned 😂
Completely unwilling to accept Keemstar’s “blood money” but will happily <b>devour</b> his ill-gotten chocolate. What a clown
How could he say he wanted nothing to do with the lolcow podcast? The idea was so good that he tried to steal it.
He is doing this to make up for losing John Rambo.
this like the ramblings of a madman at this point
His face is extra droopy in this video.  He looks like he&#39;s bombed out of his mind and needs to get escorted to bed.<br><br>Can anyone imagine sharing this video to your grandmother?  She&#39;d put your ass in a fucking home and disown you.
He&#39;s losing his damn mind
Keem knows how to let the ginpig squeal like no other, I bet he doesn&#39;t even enjoy it that much as it&#39;s just to easy for him.
Keemstar sent Phil flowers… is he making stuff up?
He’s drunk as hell in this video. Dude is spiraling

I would much rather watch Salt knock Gibs head off
does keem expect to sign half of these crossover boxers and not have them fight each other?
Keem needs to piss off
W Packgod L Keem
Philippines has 2 major and super popular sports. &quot;Basketball&quot; and &quot;Boxing&quot; even kids in the young age of 4  do boxing on fiestas events for fun and lots of rural area there lots of kids do street boxing fight for fun like its their play time no proper training on the gym just hitting banana trees and car tires to train. thats how they learn how to punch. so the rumor is just an ignorant statement
Who is this salt papi? Are they talking about that cook?
Popular tag, Say no to keem
keemstar is a joke
I thought he was cárteldesanta🫥
Keem is a big hypocrite cause JJ was the only guy that respected him when he started now man&#39;s talking bad on his name big clown just like his channel
Is this man cancelled or not . How is he here . Honestly keem is a scumbag . U can go search up on YouTube videos of why he should be cancelled and why he is a scumbag. I mean they are not hard to find . This dude is a certified scam artist and a piece of shit individual . I just hate everything he says . He always says something so stupid . Why does misfits give him the  platform to express his  opinion and be involved. Sorry for the rant
I’m sorry but salt wouldn’t wanna do more than 4 rounds with jj
Keem is such a fuckin  leech.<br>Always wanna play YouTube gatekeeper.<br>Idk why anyone wanted to sign with him to begin with especially those from the uk.
I don’t understand why salt wants more money he’s not worth it literally what they are paying him to go three rounds with Anthony Taylor is damn near twice as much as he’s worth which is nuts. And plus he wants more money but says he doesn’t fight for the money he’s a good boxer but a bad businessman
Bro&#39;s wearing a shirt with my name on it
Wtf packgod out of nowhere
Get rid of keem please 😂😅drama alert flopped 😂
Can we pls!! get this bald dumbass off the platform. Boxing, YouTube, everything, this guy knows nothing of anything he talks about
Salt box skills is not even the level of KSI, Salt ring IQ is like a a pro boxer.
I really wish Keem was not apart of the influencer boxing scene, bro is one of the biggest casuals and biased guys yet.
Never liked keem never will
Keemstar shut your ass up
Kemstar sounds dumb asf... Pbc same fight groups fight
KEEM is wrong to try to dispel the Salt Papi Myth
Keem needs to understand it’s influencer boxing, but it’s still boxing. You can’t stop fighters from fighting each other because they in the same promotion, there’s no friends in this game
Wouldn’t more rounds be better if Salt Papi can do more rounds like he says AT will keep coming forward because he knows it’s only 3 rounds
Fuck i cant stand Keem. Ive watched JJ for like 12 years and ive never heard anyone call him &quot;Double Jay&quot; 💀
Hahahahahahahahaha 😂😂🤦🏾🤦🏾. <br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the other way around CringeStar. Everyone wants or needs JJ as their opponent because he&#39;s the main event and brings the most eyes and money. Unlike salt or anyone else
real talk; the only reason why I watch misfits series is because of fighters like Salt &amp; Anthony and KSI who? doesn&#39;t even entertaining to watch.
Influencer boxing getting the same issues as the pro scene because of shit like this. Where promotors protect their fighters against loses because they are afraid they will lose value when they lose
Keemstar is high again
whens the foxtheg pack?
won&#39;t happen but anyways, packgod vs ksi, thoughts !?!
what the actual fuck is pack god doing there
what the fuck is packgod doing here?
Well.
You know it’s bad when you start agreeing with fking Keemstar
Ayoo wtf is packgod doin there 😂🤣
How Kim fresh 19 year old girlfriend doing lol 😂
Who&#39;s that other guy?
Cap..salt papi is a clout chaser
Rils and wills have said Keem signed a lot YouTube fighters they have to fight each other eventually. Keem dont know shit about boxing he knows money and that is it
Am i tweaking or is that Packgod in the blue shirt.
he signed half the misfits fighters what does he expect.
wheres the link 😭
Ksi fans are hating on salt papi so bad. they r turned on so fast after ksi started acting a clown on twittr towards salt. When ksi fanboys rate a fighter other than ksi, it means nothing bcoz they switch on that person as soon as their lord ksi does. This means their opinions r not coming from appreciating the fighter, his character or his performances but rather if this person is on good terms with ksi or not. Absolutely pathetic, especially since ksi is the one to start trouble first by saying he can KO them...only to avoid them later.

Already botched the lie. He never said he was going to be on, but he offered it
This man turn down 50k. Think about that.
Phil is so pathetic.
This is just like on Jan 6th when Keem was crying about nick fuentes the whole day lol
I think DSP is right in these situations.
Gotta love how low IQ Phil burns bridges with everybody and continues to beg for 50 dollars a day lmao he&#39;s so ridiculous.
DSP, if you really are in financial ruins and were in desperate need of money, the smart thing to do would have been to be on the podcast.  Grow a set, I mean keemstar has had a dodgy past but still wtf my guy
So when people &quot;make shit up&quot; about Phil on the internet, he expects anyone to check the facts. But when he hears about what Keemstar might have done, he doesn&#39;t even want to have anything to do with him.
Pᵣₒmₒˢᵐ
&quot;Keemstar is worse than me&quot;<br>&gt;gets caught yanking it on stream&lt;
Let&#39;s be honest: If Keemstar contacted DSP, he&#39;d ignore him anyhow...
Phil should feel lucky that anyone attempted to have a business relationship with him.
&quot;I ignored it&quot; Also DSP &quot;I never got any offer or heard about it&quot;
DSP has to be THE MOST pathetic man alive.
Exactly!! If someone rejects a $50K check bc they don’t want to talk to someone on the phone, then they clearly don’t have financial issues, and this shows his lies when it comes to his begging for tips.
He has the comprehension and emotional intelligence of an 8 year old.
TLDR: dsp is stupid, does something stupid. Costs himself 50k
I know these are old clips but f*k this guy. He is in no position talking down to people like that.<br><br>EDIT: Phil, you&#39;ve seriously could&#39;ve just said &quot;No and I&#39;m not interested&quot; instead of dicking around with Keem. Also, why don&#39;t you call Keem when you&#39;re free. Your logic makes no sense.
DSP is always busy, his streams is all about money stops to do the top dono superchat you deraill your own stream to read a message that talks about your cat. this is the reason no sponsors will touch him. If they see this now they wont work with him if he does call me at this time OKAY only or send me the text. No when its business related its threw a call so everything can be set n recorded. Nobody will trust him to write back.
He sure talks tough.
“ORGANIC GROWTH” lol
In all honesty, Keem was probably hoping DSP would answer during stream to see if Phil would be the man he pretends to be; Telling Keem he isn&#39;t interested w/o being able to control the narrative of how everything happened. <br><br>Phil would never say he hates Keem if he could respond w/o Phil&#39;s filter.
With Phil you must feed his ego and give him money. Both in the same time. Definition of pig roach!
I hope that’s the last keem or anyone else will try to help DarkSydeBegger that man is truly living garbage.
Remember to squeeze banana phil. Oops the camera&#39;s on.
Anyone Notice That Phil Haircut Taking the paint off the Walls?? Soon Phil Needs Tips to paint his Room lol
One of the most pathetic moments in lolcock history
The begging would continue to Phil&#39;s deathbed. Nothing can stop him.
Keemstar is just trying to exploit dsp like everyone else including this channel. No show was ever in the cards.
Is this the only detractor channel left?
What happened to that cult of hate channel
You&#39;d think Phil, a guy who&#39;s been a content creator for over 12 years, would know that views don&#39;t mean anything without any retention
Dsp is as pathetic as pathetic can get. His begging was in jeopardy so he did what unintelligent human beings do when they have no intelligent response, insult the other person by using a bunch of profanity and name calling. Hopefully the podcast moves on with someone else and all those guys make good money and dsps viewers money dries up and he has to get a regular job.
Thanks for telling us that you want to beg to your denthead wheelchairs for the rest of your life like you have already told us years ago.
How many YouTube people struggling would take that money and do it ? Keemstar is trying to help him and DSP is too stupid judging from this. Like he can&#39;t take a call at a certain time or the world of streaming will end.
&quot;His reputation is far worse than mine would ever be&quot; Yet Keem has f-you money and you rake in only 21 bucks during that rant. Pro beggars don&#39;t have pride, Boyo, it doesn&#39;t work that way.
All he has to do is make up 5 more 1MM and he&#39;ll make $250 a night
Phil constantly begs for money and views, but won&#39;t accept a money making deal?
Look I hate Keem because he&#39;s a terrible human and for all the drama he was in, but....................50k is 50k lol
How to lose 50k in one ban
This old delusional shcizo bum literally is full of excuses lol!
Good on DSP for having values and morals
DSP turning down 50k just goes to show he has money. He just still begs.
I don&#39;t ever want to hear him whine bout not being able to pay his bills to guilt trip people into donating again. He had a golden opportunity and blew it.
I am not a children&#39;s entertainer 🍌squeeze banana
Moron fumbled the bag for the other two involved as well.  I&#39;d be pissed if I were Wings or Boogie
Wow DSP didn&#39;t want $50.000🤔🤦🏻‍♂️🤣😂😳🤯
He&#39;s soooo professional.<br><br>Too stupid...says the guy stuck on level 1.
Pretty sure I lost all my brain cells listening to Phil’s logic and explanation",PT9M59S,-0.9639
"Keemstar buddy, listen...","This needed to be said.
Wingsofredemption admitted to giving a child multiple unnecessary enemas to ""treat"" what he was told by a doctor was a psychological condition, not a medical one.  Wings has admitted to this, and along with his comments about lowering the age of consent to 12, and saying to allow child pr0n at age 12, combine to paint a clear and damning picture.  This isn't the first time Keemstar has elevated child predators, including Basherverse and Onlyusemeblade.  Lately he's even entertained the idea of elevating EDP445, which should be the final straw for many people.  If he continues down this path, there is only one outcome.  As this is happening, Youtube continues to destroy important content creators with its broken copywrite takedown system.  There was a time, not too long ago, when Keemstar would be the voice of Youtube creators, using Twitter to agitate on behalf of those who've been wronged by it.  Distracted by his latest endeavors, he's ignored this much more worthwhile use of his time.  I hope this video helps people understand where I'm coming from, and maybe perhaps it can help create a more positive change in the landscape we live in.

I hate chocolate milk so big ups keem
Nice Chanel👍
The cows are nightmare fuel lol
I don&#39;t care if Keem is a good person or not.  He&#39;s making Phil dance.  If Keem accidently shoots himself in the face while making Phil dance, that&#39;ll be even funnier.<br><br>I have no attachment to these people.  I just want to laugh at regards.  People moral flagging over a-logs isn&#39;t funny.  And claiming there&#39;s, &quot;no more chocolate milk&quot; is disingenuous.  We have more lolcows than just DSP, Wings, and Boogie.  Far, FAR more.<br><br>tl:dr - If one cow dies, two more take its place.  Lighten up and enjoy the show.
The issue is, Keem, Craig, and Rich all see profit, benefits, and a untapped market they can take advantage of.<br><br>They come in with these big dreams, over ambitious, and gatekeeping.. it’s a grift, in my opinion, nothing genuine about it. <br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23monetizethehaters"">#MonetizeTheHaters</a> <br><br>👆cringeworthy move, but it worked, ppl threw money at him like dent heads do with DSP- because, he is talking like a detractor, but with a bad accent &amp; basic level, not fluently. <br><br>The interview was a success, it did what I felt was beyond expectations- a classic.<br><br>Should’ve left it there..
Uh... Wut? :D
How many people here, listening to this, are sad that there&#39;s no more chocolate milk?  :(
when I saw the title I thought we would hear the return of ludwig
1) if wings admitted to this, and said he was directed to do so by a doctor, are you mad at him for admitting it, at the doctor for recommending it, or simply for the act itself?<br>2) do you genuinely feel wings&#39; comments on age of consent have any bearing on his actions as a person? <br><br>i don&#39;t agree w/ wings views or actions in regards to these issues but i&#39;m genuinely curious what the response is to these questions
Lolcow Chocolate Milk 🚀
Normally I&#39;d agree for any other lolcow, but DSP will live through the heat death of the universe.<br><br>Don&#39;t stoop to his level, don&#39;t break the law, and do it in the name of entertainment and it&#39;s all good in my book.
Some of these images are nightmare fuel lol
I couldent have said it better myself 🤌
the framing of the fight as a &quot;redemption&quot; arc for either boogie or wings was where my irritation came from. Neither of them have redeemed anything, they were just two fat men having a slapfight for 50k
Would love to see more of this
Seeing Keem on Craig&#39;s podcast the other night was bordering on adorable in some ways.<br>&#39;Well maybe if we held a video game competition, then he wou-&#39; No.<br>Just.<br>No.
Keem just won&#39;t take WWE Champions for an answer..
Not what I was expecting when I clicked this video, but a welcome surprise.
Its not as funny as you thought it was when you uploaded it
Does it count as irony that Keemstar owns a dairy farm IRL? I&#39;ve seen people bring up wanting Wings to &quot;prove&quot; he&#39;s not a pdf, by beating up EDP, but - unless I missed something - Keem wants to get Tipster punched in the face, instead, for the high crime of being annoying. I&#39;m not quite with you on having Keemstar appoint himself the moral arbiter of youtube, and he&#39;s pushed back on people wanting him to platform Onlyusemeblade, but it&#39;s definitely a conversation worth having him do a twitter space.
Make one about DSPs bullshit stories he makes up, ya know... when he goes to the supermarket to buy his groceries lol
What a wholesome message. Hope he hears what you (and others in this community) have been saying. I&#39;d also like to send the same message to DSP, Wings, Boogie and whoever detractors everywhere who might be tempted to jump onto this &quot;wave of positivity&quot; in a desperate attempt for the &quot;legitimacy&quot; they think they&#39;ve been searching for: Our legitimacy doesn&#39;t come from having hundreds of thousands of subscribers, or making ridiculous money. Our clout comes from the fact that we are moral, and on the right side of this divide between a-logs and lolcows.<br><br>Thanks for reading my essay.
Hold on, you forgot that Cocoa comes from the same plant that Cocaine comes from....TMDWU!
I really hate how whatever AI you use does faces
I thought this was about Keemstar shoving chocolate up DSP&#39;s ass, causing him to cry chocolate tears, which Keemstar drank.
I see what you are saying. I&#39;ve never thought about it this way, especially the way you have it written in the description. To be honest, I don&#39;t think Keemstar is a &quot;good person&quot;. I don&#39;t think wings or any lolcows are a &quot;goodperson&quot;. I think its all about the money. He&#39;s bassically a culture vulture. Honestly the best thing one can do is just watch this trashheap burn from a distance. Whatever type of showbiz youtube is, morality and ethics are always going to be second place to money sadly. Personally I don&#39;t want DSP to dissapear from youtube. Why? Regadless of how shitty he is as a person, I still enjoy keeping up with the pigroach. Frankly its not that deep. Let them all fight in the slop and mud for all I care
Lmao
These ai pictures you are using now are terrible 😂
Wtf did I just watch?!
The AI images concern me and reassure me<br><br>They reassure me because my brain can tell that these are fake if I pay attention to details, especially on the face (ironically AI isnt good at replicating imperfections on the skin).<br>The concern is that I know that there are some people that cant and the AI might improve with time to the point I cant tell anymore.
Keem slaughtered my entire family and made me watch.
If Keem&#39;s new business model is &quot;redemption arcs for lolcows&quot; then we will get caught in the crossfire. At that point, Keem&#39;s motivations will run counter to ours, and we can already see how that&#39;s unfolding in the Wings community since the fight.
This ratchet AI content is out of hand, and I love it!
is keemstar trying to revive internet bloodsports podcast?.
Powerful and meaningful message
Not defending or condoning anything these people do, just pointing out the fact that it&#39;s not that bad. The reason nothing happens to people like Wings or Philip, is because there&#39;s far worse going on in the world that need fixing first..<br><br>Wings thinks 12 is a good age of consent? Has he done anything about it? Multiple younger girls than that are being rpd daily while trying to illegally invade the US. Wouldn&#39;t that be a better cause to put effort in to fixing, then concentrate on Wings? 3 muslims held down a girl at school while a 4th rpd her. Is that as bad as anything wings has done? TV didn&#39;t even report it.<br><br>A girl was returning me from a night out, she mistakenly got in to a fake Uber. The foreigner smashed her head against the dash, she was knocked out, she awoke later after being rpd by the man and his friends in every hole multiple times. She begged to be let go and he refused. She fought back, got out of the car and managed to run home before he caught her. He was sentenced to a couple of years in prison. Happened in Ireland. No one cares, the TV wouldn&#39;t even report it.<br><br>There are infinitely worse things going on every second than some ill-thought-out comment by a fat man in South Carolina. There are better causes to fight.
I just grew a freckle, wth?
Keemstar always has been and will be a shark. He knows how to play the game. He knows how to bully or buy his way into any business and then jumps ship the minute there&#39;s hot water. He&#39;s a lot like DSP in that he can&#39;t take criticism. He has an excuse for everything and plays the victim. The difference is Keemstar knows what he&#39;s doing and DSP doesn&#39;t. Don&#39;t let him fool you. Keem doesn&#39;t give a shit about anyone but himself.
I was so exited to see some cursed AI generated human cow.<br>Kinda disappointed but also glad to avoid the nightmare fuel.<br>Interesting analogy.
This is perfect.
Who cares about the farmers in this sitiation.   The goal is to kill THIS cow.  There are plenty of other cows to get much better, more tasty milk with less toxic chemicals.<br><br>If 10 farms need to close...so be it.  So long as this cow is put down for good.
Big ups LWO, loved you on That Being Said.
You put it eloquently. I agree. Glad people are having fun, but I think it is important to think this through.
Lmao
naw , accelerationism is the only way. KEEM WILL get the Gunt to fight as many child diddlers as the sektur demands, and they will conquer all of trafficking through celebrity boxing.
Just because the farmers say dont touch the poopoo doesnt mean anyone else even know that rule exists.

Logan trying to pretend that h3h3 isn&#39;t one of the ogs and most famous youtubers
Complains about Keemstar apparently bullying kids, while scamming kids over and over with gambling sites and pump/dump Bitcoin bs.
But the problem is Keemstar HAS NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR ANYTHING. Ever. He half-ass tried. But he can’t even remember half the shit he talks about people. Hes a rape apologist. He thinks oral rape isn’t a thing. “Just turn your head” were his words. Dead to me. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cancelkeemstar"">#cancelkeemstar</a>
<a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=al8m6rI6sKY"">youtube.com/watch?v=al8m6rI6sKY</a>
and u did an interview with that clown
Man. Keemstar is a shit pile. Ethan acknowledges his flaws publicly. Stop being so soft my guy. I talk way worse shit to people I love. Stop proving yourself to twelve year olds and find your spine. Get a job in construction or something and find out how men talk to each other.
Wait.... this video was 8 months ago?🤔
This coming from people who filmed a dead body in a forest. Correction all youtubers are scumbag e beggars
Ugh 🙄🙄🙄
For the solution u need to know about problem, and that&#39;s a fact
Mike is so fucking lame
When you “don’t care” bout a subject but still need that click bait tho. Talkin bout cutting out that part of the podcast but it still makes it to highlights 😂
asmr eating
Not a big Logan fan but respect u two on this but I hate keem
Hearing Logan say this shit is so ironic😂
Literally reading a script. You guys act like hes so insightful mike and Logan are both reading a script from their computer.
Imagine actually caring about anything these guys have to say.<br><br>That said... keemstar is even more of a parasite.

Suicide forest boi upset cuz H3 getting all the views lol Mike makes a great few point tho!
Man when he said keen you want your legacy to be just a person who does anything for views Logan got flashbacks
Well said Mike 👍
why is no one talking about how h3h3 also made pego allegations causing patrice to say he wanted to kill himself? neither of them are innocent
Wish they’d just get to the point rather than acting like they don’t care...it doesn’t make you look cool
Gtfo, did I just agree with Logan Paul?
H3H3&#39;s whole brand is being mean/bullying other people and making himself look dumb and i love it.
This gonna be the Covid of YouTube , Youtubers with power taking sponsors from each other getting demonetized for a middle finger “sarcasm” companies deleting videos with there content on it, This all gonna go downhill
I mean Logan as every right not to care so all good he as at the top
Honestly mike that was probably one of the most meaningful things I’ve heard. Spending hours on solutions I need to remember that
I like mike but I also don’t for the fact I feel Logan replaced him with even and mike is getting all the spotlight <br><br>Man I really miss the og days with Logan and even in the apartment 😢
Who are you guys again? 😂
Pretends has nothing to say .....  reads from pre meditated speech
Keem’s a douche but neither seem like they’re right so I don’t care lol
Everyone in the comments is a psychologist apparently
Suicide forest’s boy was spittin for a sec
Bro come on everyone knows who they are, its not a super specific part. That said, I wish yall would speak out on keem, he needs to learn bro
Never thought I&#39;d totally agree with Logan on anything in life. I have to say that he spoke with a level of maturity that Keemstar will only likely achieve on his deathbed.
That’s the guy who claps Lana Rhodes booty cheeks for free right ?
H3H3 and Keemstar are old men trying to claw their way back to relevancy. Talk bout a midlife crisis lol
Keem and Trisha man... they&#39;re both disgusting on this platform its sad.
Thank you for giving this stupid beef the attention it deserved. I&#39;ve actually tried to get into it, but I&#39;m not sitting through and hours worth of character assassination from H3H3, for a guy I already know is a piece of shit. Water is wet, Keem is an asshole. Next.
Dude holy shit I respect Logan and Mike for these takes
Yo it&#39;s probably cuz I&#39;m drunk but this is actually sorta funny, like not ironically
Why isn’t this viral! This is said so perfect!! Thank you mike for not diving to deep but giving the Internet what they need to hear thank you!
The first 2 minutes are just garbage. Either talk about it or don&#39;t.
Logan is doing great
Tbh, I just don&#39;t care anymore at first I did care now not at all. At the end of the day it&#39;s basically: <br>Keemstar=bad <br>H3h3=bad but not so bad but kinda bad but like not that bad, If you catch ma drift.

I never got why he got so much h8 dude been on yt since day1 bk when it was grimey af hes been having a mid life crisis 4 a deacade ... thats impressive
I laugh so hard at the Keem impression, “IIIAAM BEEEEING STAAABED”! My ribs hurt!😂
The diss is fire though 🔥 👌
Ego rythm? Who is she? Ew. Barf on her shoes.
This idiot saying he&#39;s &#39;on call&#39; to youtube like a healthcare/emergency worker makes me angry. I have a family member who works in a healthcare facility and is on call even on days off so we can barely spend time with them if at all and it&#39;s really stressful for them but this little garbage gremlin uses the term like it&#39;s the same thing

crazy how leos song sounds better than a lot of popular music today.

But this diss track fuckin slappsss thooo wttttffff
I agree with Many of the things he said but sometimes keem goes overboard, like with what he did to that old man, like these times it truly feels like he&#39;s heartless and hypocritical and that&#39;s what makes me not respect him
Daaaaaamn Leo, the song was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Mad how u gained over 2k in like a week since I first found your channel, proud of u wtf 😖
According to Keemstar, it&#39;s cool to date 12 year old children as long as they enjoy the movie JAWS.......
Leo, you don&#39;t need to weaponize your followers to attack him.....the dude is already a loser. Also, going by his logic. It would be ok for him to date a 13 year old as long as they enjoy the movie JAWS.........
This wasn’t a diss track… this was a fucking crime scene… that man has to be dead now.
Yknow I watched a recent stream that keem was on, and it got a bit off topic and he actually said that he wants to sell DramaAlert (and has a couple takers) but he wants to sell it for a good amount of money.
Mans retirement didn&#39;t last all that long.
I can&#39;t understand the lyrics at the end because the instrumentals are way too loud need better mixing.
Holy shit that track was dope
great video and you are a great singer.... wow amazing
A summer jam
The worst part about him should be that partycity beard but here we are.
🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
The diss track went harder then his whole career.
That Dis track was fire &lt;3 Unlike keemstar, good riddance to bad rubbish.<br> No girl would be into that with out cash as incentive. XD
Keemstar only gets along with girls half his age because he&#39;s intellectuality stunted...
Gotta say, your impression of him sounds like him doing an impression of Seinfeld.
Gotta say, for a guy who&#39;s 40, he sounds like the biggest boomer, whining about cancel culture. Bro you&#39;re the second hand Joe Rogan. Actually, he&#39;s probably leaving because his entire thing is being cannibalized by bigger, more popular, more bitter people than him.
I can&#39;t wait to see DILF Leo
I would genuinely recommend Leafy as his replacement!<br>Either that or Scarce.<br>Or James Corden......
BARS!
It would be nightmare too man
Bro that diss was so fire.
I’ve been bingeing your channel. Thank you Leo! Damn, you are a gem. Keep it up, you deserve what you want to have ❤️
yooo this diss trackkk
You got me wheeze laughing subbed I hope your channel grows for a long time to come
Oh my god the old guy almost crying on stream broke my heart
I don&#39;t like Ethan. He&#39;s arguably worst than Keemstar
You def bodied this song Big Baby
He just upset cuz he doesn&#39;t fit in this new age of YouTube. I think this is another great time in YouTube. Its a time where intelligence is super important these days an it makes for some beautiful content. Less morons is a good thing, I&#39;m the same age as this jackass. I&#39;ve unfortunately had to deal with that fact. I&#39;m the same age as squeamstar, an our views are Nothing alike. What a fucking boomer.
took me 6 months to see these 🔥 bars
that song of yours was awesome ,great dis track for real
I like news
Keemstar is a rare example of real person who suffers from crippling Flanderization. If he were a sitcom character, people who be writing to the network have his character &quot;killed off&quot;, &quot;put on the bus&quot; or &quot;have him return to his home planet&quot;.

We all know that this video is going to be interesting to watch okay
Lol
Well that didn&#39;t last long
The Internet superpowers have joined up? History repeats.
and they say Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover ever
Ignoring the hypocrisy oh Logan’s statement, wishing for someone’s mother’s fucking funeral to be swatted by police for a false bomb threat is disgusting. Wishing for people’s children to be harassed is disgusting. This dude Logan has something wrong with him
If there&#39;s anyone that makes sense for them to unite against its Logan he&#39;s like the black sheep of popular you tubers and I don&#39;t feel sorry for him at all

Haven&#39;t watched the video yet, but what if...<br>What if Ethan, and Keemstar&#39;s public feud has been THE MOST MASSIVE TROLLING IN HISTORY?! <br>Probably not, but that would actually be f***ing hilarious.
The mid-rolls doe
This is the moment Walt became Heisenberg.
it&#39;s castle itter all over again
The only people Keem and Ethan hate more than eachother; the Pauls.
This must be what Britain and France felt like after the 7 year war<br><br>But yeah lets be honest, Nobody likes logan paul, he is probably the more Edgy and Cringeworthy person on the planet, but i feel that&#39;s more of a complement to his Massive Ego.
This is the biggest video game cross over of all time
Funny. Apart, I despise both of them. But together? Not as much. I mean, I still hate them, but at least they&#39;re doing something productive together.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
after all this time of being maked fun of... now its finally happening!<br><br>Keemstar x H3H3 is real
Not sure if LOGAN PAUL is allowed to make any judgment...

Hey bowblax can you stop removing my comments .<br>Like I know that you hate freedom of speech when it comes down to calling out H3H3 on their BS in the past .<br>But common .<br>Maybe they will remove you videos up next.
Give them a week .<br>Keem or H3 will find a way to hate one another for no reason .
Logan should beat them the hell up , they so annoying like fr
This is like the meme of the two burly guys holding hands. Goes to show that when one commentary channel gets canceled everyone jumps on him. However when two of them get cancelled then no one can stop them.
this is a weird episode of Centricide
no he missed the chance to say &quot;all i needed was a bite of beef but logan gave me the whole cow.&quot;
Bro that laugh at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-9e8_GFsK0&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a> O_o
For once I will side with the gnome
Logan wasn’t saying “ go harrass them” he was like why romanatwood, why him? Why not someone like h3h3 or keem, he never said he wants that to happen to anyone, he was simply confused as to why roman got that but not someone who’s well hated on tje internet like h3h3 or keem
I know h3h3 has the title for being the biggest hypocrite (correct me if I’m wrong on that) but I think Logan just took that title from him.
2 enemsy teaming up to take on a same threat is anime 101
They aren&#39;t teaming up
Why have I not seen one reference to the suicide forest
Don&#39;t like any of these people
&quot;2 old men team up agains an internet dumbass&quot;
didnt think keem knew he had kids
pretty funny to hear logan paul call anyone scum 😂
This is totally off-topic but I’m gonna say this anyways. If you’re willing to go to the level of harassing somebody by turning off the fucking power grid, sending bomb threats at a funeral, and hacking their security cameras knowing that there’s kids in the house… You deserve to be doxxed yourself. You deserve to have all of your private information leaked to the public. What these people did is fucking disgusting because they put his life in danger and his kids lives, so these people intern should be put in danger themselves. They do not deserve any privacy at all.
Might be time for Logan to visit that Japanese Forrest again, but not as a tourist..
They should go after KeemStar. He&#39;s been responsible for harassment of other creators he didn&#39;t like, just like the stuff he&#39;s saying is hidious. Honestly hope someone shuts off his power so he can&#39;t record shitty videos anymore.
Did keemstar confess to murder or am I just missing something? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-9e8_GFsK0&amp;t=4m06s"">4:06</a>
Love how they&#39;re laughing at keep on that podcast but... why they booing? He&#39;s right.
I mean if they legit teamed up.  They would be pretty powerful.  Im not a fan of either of them... but its like if thanos and magneto teamed up to destroy the world

Plot twist: the judge reads into phil&#39;s history and instantly becomes a detractor
What threats did keem make? Did he make them while sending the flowers and chocolates?
The drama is the only thing that keeps his channel viable and the only ones to benefit from this drama are the great detractor channels that Phil is supporting.
No one is going to share the damn video.  What a weirdo!
This is why DSP will never find success on the internet. Literal Keemstar contacts him, offers him 50k and a podcast, puts up with his bs and constantly gives him second chances and what does DSP do? Cries, ignores him, runs away and threatens him to never contact him again. Phil uses the phrase &quot;egotistical delusion&quot; and I think it describes him perfectly. He&#39;d rather continue begging his fans for money and barely scraping by.
Phil is unreal He&#39;s the kind of guy that would be in the cafeteria at school at the table next to you talking s*** about you and when you turned around and said. Hey!! he&#39;d stand up and start screaming that you&#39;re a stalker. Welcome to the public life phil
I hope Keemstar laced the cookies and chocolates with laxatives
Level 1
Phil thinks this is an episode of Simpsons or family guy where if he turns down a large sum of money cause of the &quot;morals&quot; of the other person giving him the money, he&#39;ll get praised and showered with affection from everybody. Thinking that he&#39;ll get more money for being on the moral high ground, and turning down the offer from the &quot;evil rich person&quot;. Phil, let me say this once and only once: you&#39;re a fucking idiot for not taking that money and letting your pride get the best of you. You&#39;re the living embodiment of the seven sins and you&#39;re way too delusional to see it. That&#39;s life changing money for a good 85% of the earth&#39;s populace and you threw it away just cause of &quot;DAAAAAH, I DONT LIKE THAT GUY!&quot; ANYBODY would&#39;ve taken that money and done the podcast in an instant. YOU as an over all person have no morals, your &quot;fans&quot; are literally mentally ill ppl that YOU mooch off of. For someone in YOUR position in life, this decision was a NO BRAINER but you decided to take some form of a &quot;moral high ground&quot; cause of keemstar ALONE and not take the deal. That and you didn&#39;t like the podcast cause it was called &quot;the LOLcow podcast&quot;. Let me tell you something BRUHDER, you&#39;re an LOLcow. Doesn&#39;t matter how YOU wanna put it, by definition you&#39;re an LOLcow. EVERYBODY sees you as an LOLcow. Imagine if Kat heard that you blew a 50k deal with someone just cause you didn&#39;t like them, and keep in mind you could&#39;ve gotten more money from the podcast itself when super chats and donations are gonna be running through. YOU Phil Burnell deserve where you&#39;re at in life cause your IQ is lower then Canadian temperatures in winter, and you&#39;re a homunculus blob on humanity, always squealing like a pot belly pig when shit doesn&#39;t go your way.
Keem is like a cat playing with a mouse and Piggy is too dented to understand that.
Keemstar hat should be a tips goal.
Keemstar should tweet every day saying that if DSP doesn&#39;t do <i>____</i> he&#39;s kicked off the podcast, last chance. Drive DSP crazy.
I wish we can live in a world where we can throw tomatoes at our screens  and hit him in real life
He’s now saying Keem is threatening him 😂 he’s completely lost his mind
I always love Phi&#39;s &quot;he never called me at the specified times&quot; story since this is coming from the same guy that also said he would never work with Keem so why waste everyone&#39;s time?
DSP is the kid that start a fight, gets his arse kicked, then goes and tell the world the other person is a wimp and he kicked his arse not the other way around. DSP, you lose again.
“Keemstar is slandering people” <br><br>-  guy who’s slandering Keemstar about what he heard
Phil is hands down the most pathetic person I&#39;ve ever seen
This is hilariously Phil being his usual
Ha! He wishes Keem would ask him out. Maybe then he&#39;ll finally get over Rambo.
DSP pe3do arc is next
&quot;Good for them if they make a million dollars. I&#39;m too proud to accept money from people I don&#39;t like.<br><br>Anyway, tips are kind of low, guys, and I need help to pay my bills. I can count on you, right?&quot;
“everything i’m saying is a joke” okay phil
DSP might be the stupidest level 1 salesman on the planet.
I really hope keem FUCKS DSP, he absolutely deserves it. Nothing but insults, lies, craziness, snorts and gout. GO KEEM
Phil is like the Prince and Princess of Canada from South Park
normal adult human - blocks person he doesnt care for, ignore if anyone brings them up, situation over<br>massive b1tch dsp - cry about something he can easily avoid, makes constant videos about them<br>This dude cakes himself in clown make up with every new day he wakes up
if he really wanted people to keep his name out of their mouths, he&#39;d stop being a public figure. you can&#39;t just have people stop talking about you when you put your face out there for everyone to see, spouting off awful takes and verbal diarrhea every night on stream. seriously, if he wanted to spend more time with his wife the only person stopping him from doing that is him.
&quot;obsessed person that needs to be stopped&quot; but derich literally harassing pornstars to the point they block him is fine
So mad he got busted trying to steal his idea.  This video is delusions of a madman.  Just because you say it&#39;s stalking doesn&#39;t make it stalking weirdo.
Local man gives final response for fifth time this week.
I love how he&#39;s changed the story over each of these videos.<br><br>So at first keem never talked to him or offered him 50k. Says Keem never tried to contact him or get in contact.<br>Immediately contradicted by mentioning him going on the podcast, where he offers 50k. Admits that Keem contiouesly tried to contact him and he knew it.<br><br>Says he never talked to Boogie or WOR about a podcast with the 3 that cuts out Keem.<br>Proceeds to say that they didn&#39;t have any official talks, but they were waiting for the fight to be over. Says he&#39;d never work with Keem, so they&#39;d split the proceeds 3 ways.<br><br>Says he&#39;d never steal a show from Keem. Never agreed to do a podcast with Keem.<br>Elaborates that the show with he, Boogie and Wings, wouldn&#39;t have the same name. That it would be unethical, and Keem might have cause to sue.<br><br>He&#39;s really just selling this narrative to his 200 streamers, and he knows no one else believes him. The only reason he&#39;s doing these videos is because no one has thought about him since Keem made it known he wanted on a podcast.
it is really crazy that he still had a possibility of getting on the podcast(probably not) but still declines the 50k offer, he rather whines and complains about money.<br><br>He for sure is a delusional schizophrenic person who doesnt leave the house unless its for groceries and genuinely needs an entire day for that because mentally it takes a huge toll on him
the king of playing victim
Oh man he’s gonna get trolled so hard for this response 😂
I really hope the audio of him trying to explain this to a judge for a restraining order gets leaked
I can’t tell if he made this entire video just to build up more drama, or if he really got flowers from the guy?<br>Just remember u guys, he’s done talking about Keemstar, all the drama. So come back tomorrow where Keemstar apparently is after DSP for child support cause he got the gnome boi preggers
&quot;I&#39;m not going to be eating any more chocolate from Keemstar any more!&quot; Might be one of the funniest things he has ever said.
More hilarity from our favorite Lulcow DarkSydePhil.
level one baby
😂😂😂 restraining order for what?
&quot;final response&quot;<br>20 min later....keem @ tweets Phil &quot;.&quot;<br>5 seconds after tweet Phil has an emergency beg stream crying about this vicious attack on his family by Keem and the period tweet.
&quot;Leave me alone, I don&#39;t want any part of any drama&quot;<br>But also<br>&quot;This is my stream and I can say what I want about these pieces of shit, fuck them. They&#39;re assholes&quot;
He’s such a passive-aggressive little b***h.
Sounds like he loved the gifts and is being an ass lol
&quot;This is my final response&quot;<br>Much like how in wrestling there&#39;s always one more &quot;last match&quot; in a feud.<br><br>Edit: for a guy that&#39;s &quot;happily married&quot; he sure talks alot about scat and dating men.

I couldn’t disagree with Keem more about losing perspective because you dropped your character for a while. <br><br>When you’ve opened up to us about your struggles with depression and anxiety, I don’t think someone like Keem could understand that being relatable and showing empathy can help your audience, who may be going through similar struggles. <br><br>It’s a lot easier to forgive someone when they occasionally drop the charade and act like a real human being to the public.

Keemstar on mve
Okay , so I watched this through because I enjoy your work Boogie, and I want to see you continue to succeed.<br><br>I was curious whether Keemstar would say anything to shake my view of him. He didn&#39;t. For me, drama YouTube has always been dull and it came across as very staged. I&#39;d happily watch a more positive YouTuber on loop than drama shows any day of the week.<br><br>Putting aside the bad stuff that has been said about Keemstar, and looking at this based purely on what he&#39;s said himself here, I just don&#39;t get the appeal. He&#39;s arrogant, and it felt like he&#39;s deflecting criticism for the most part.<br><br>Keemstar is also not the bad guy he&#39;s trying to be. The best bad guys have substance. He has a hokey delivery style and a desire to stir stuff up. I can&#39;t hate him because he doesn&#39;t grab me in a way that makes me care enough. It has been years since I watched one of his videos, and it&#39;ll be a long time before I try again, if I do at all. He&#39;s honestly just not worth dedicating time to.<br><br>And to answer the question asked : I have no issue finding things to watch on YouTube and it has recommended plenty of fun stuff to me. So, no. I&#39;m not bored.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXdd_aOu7Q&amp;t=31m28s"">31:28</a> However that was not how Mr. Beast rose to fame. And like him there are hundreds more out there.
Never heard of someone telling therr parents that they wanna be a clown when they grow up
Wonder if keem was pulling those same strings he boast with etika or anyone els hes gone after for nothing
4,000.00 is a ton of money to me 😭
Fun stuff
Idk anything about keemstar (or boogie, really) but hes right about the cancel culture thing. People who want to &#39;cancel&#39; ppl want them to squirm and deny or apologize. They never attack ppl who are openly racist, for example. Bc he wont deny it and, as vile as it is, THEYRE proud of it. They own it. They want someone who will apologize so that to them its a small victory.

who knew that keemstar caused drama? what a shocking revaluation

Best Interview yet
Keemstar is the biggest poosie and cannot be identified as a MAN 😅😂
thank you for puttting this out , been trying to explain to my soon to be 14 year that  its not just putting a vid out , he want to be an youtuber when he is older
Personally I don’t have any problem finding stuff to watch on YouTube but then again what I watch is no where in the wheel house of the type of stuff Keem puts out.<br><br>That being said he is correct in that YouTube tried to push stuff at you often times getting in the way of what I actually want to watch. It’s why I often find myself just manually going into my favorites and manually choosing what to watch.
I would say I&#39;m not bored with content... then again, I&#39;m subscribed to over 300 channels (inc. non active) - I just keep well away from the recommended / curated content, manually select the channels with updates... and screw the  &#39;shorts&#39;.
What’s up, Boogie2988 of the internet. I’ve been a fan forever and I never gave up on you. So glad to see you doing well. You got me into Hearthstone long ago with WowHobbs. I’ll always be a fan of you Boogie. ❤️
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXdd_aOu7Q&amp;t=28m04s"">28:04</a> I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say we&#39;re living in a simulation (my personal belief;) but rather because of my spirituality a playground to the gods. I believe theres a higher power judging our every move; to see if we&#39;re capable of progressing into a more powerful and ethereal dimension / new reality. This Earth is only one of many many many planets. And if you think we&#39;re the only ones breathing; being watched; thats within your right of expression and beliefs. However it doesn&#39;t seem logical. Consider the &quot;for every action; theres a reaction&quot; theory as well. For every bit of dark; there&#39;s light. Thats what keeps me going.
I wish I could hug you for 34 seconds to take it all out crying of suffering. I know that feeling when people treat you like it is, but people don’t know they hurt your feelings. It sucks to live like that, pretending you are not socially anxious. After mathematics, social anxiety is a f-ing mental abuse. I played pool with a good stranger, I won and I enjoyed that “Very well” and “high five”. Something I don’t receive too much from people, even my family when I win in any game” As an autistic person, I wish I could show who I really am when I’m not anxious. If I could show so much! AAGGH!! I would love it!
Why tf did yourube tell me that this trash interview between two garbage humans was new?
I think you left your microwave open 😂
This is just one of the reasons why boogie is YT Royalty, one of the daddies!
Keem could be blamed for how messed up the internet is, but I must admit, he&#39;s good at it
Keem give me a chance to be the new news guy on drama arletr give me one chance am perfect for this I am a small time infilancer who has an amazing life I love the bissniss of clout and I am interested in the job I will work for free forever of you want I want da clout badly
Keem is the big good guy
I don’t care for this person. But I made sure to watch a small part of the video and give it a thumbs up. I did so because I really like this series and want it to continue. Thanks for the content and keep it up.
Keemstar casually saying that he is the bad guy and does it just to benefit him lmao. This man’s whole mindset is absolute fucked because it was literally tormenting peoples lives
Great work boog
ohhh, good ole schemestar
The fact that keem exploited you and made fun of and you think he is being nice u are delusional
Boogie— I think you’ve found your voice. Keep doing these long form interviews. You’re actually a natural at it. You just need to invest in some mic’s. The audio wasn’t the best here.  Despite that this is great content.
This guy seems incapable of sharing an opinion without swearing every couple words. I do understand it here and there but he literally does it in nearly every sentence! He also doesn’t seem to have an ounce of humility. I think this word is overused but…he sounds like a narcissist. This is actually my first exposure to the guy. This isn’t what I expected. I’ve only heard his name mentioned a bunch of times in relation to internet culture. So I’ve never watched his content. But I have to say I’m not impressed. 🤷‍♂️
Whenever someone tells me that they think this is all a simulation I think it’s important to immediately punch them in the face. This is not a simulation — God  gives us free will to choose.",PT1H15S,0.9995

I&#39;m sorry, hate Keem all you want but at least that dude keeps it a buck.. Ethan is the most self righteous estrogen filled clown I&#39;ve ever seen who has so much money but still attacks people for money and for good guy points.
so many different worlds just collided in a short clip, my head is spinning
I hope when Adin gets a couple years older he distances himself from FaZe Banks and Keemstar… they’re only gonna drag him down.
Are people jelous of adin he was not doing anything but its prob bc he is way better than the whole 13 year old community
and then the first thing keemstar does on adins stream is bring up the scam
From what I remember he said he was only buying milf crypto because they paid him too. It’s not like he knew they were scamming people he was just paid to promote it and did
Ah yes Ethan Klein the moral authority
who cares
Why does Ethan always butt in and weasel his way into the middle of drama
miz let the big boys talk it out
Ethan playing chess&gt;adin playing checkers
Adin says he&#39;s rich but I don&#39;t see any boxes in the background....
&quot; A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.&quot;
Nice boxes
Thats great adin ross hut look at them boxes tho
man look at those qualified scale boxes
Why is the Mizkif clips comment section so toxic? Wtf happened here?
God I hate 3/4 people here
Man just look at those boxes😊
Sorry but this stream was awful. Just one big giant circle jerk.
like keemstar is fucked up already imagine Bening frriends with him.
Watching this stream was painful it was like watching cult leaders introduce a new member to a cult and egging him into suppressing his natural tendencies to replace them with the morals of the cult.

Ngl the videos are funny but I&#39;m on no one side
I’m bemused why he became famous
its 2022 and this rat is still on youtube
BRO IT&#39;S SO FUNNY BECAUSE THE WORLD HAS BECOME MORE SHIT AFTER KEEM RETIRED 💀💀💀
this is it boys.... this is the beginning of a new age... a age of purity.... with Keem gone a large fraction of toxicity goes with him.
now we need 98% of the people that celebrated to retire as well
Bruh nothing changed since he left
Meh, we&#39;ll see if its true.

What’s crazy all those people saying they didn’t care but got keemstar notifications on hard asf like Twitter users are slow
I dislike keemstar but I respect his mental fortitude.
Hes not actually retiring.
Whether you liked him or not, I think the overwhelming hate he has is funny and sad.
Are you yet another cringey keem alog?

put keem in the mgs 3 ending this is tragic

you know ngl despite &quot;twittards&quot; being happy about keem&#39;s retirement, the internet eint getting any better and first of all no matter how much people hate keem atleast he didnt btch about people hating him and just continued delivering news like his show intended and i know why people hate keem * and i REALLY DO but heres the thing... people makes mistakes, so i just feel bad for the guy getting this much hate specially the daughter comment like, i now he deserves something but not this much jesus fcking comedown &quot;twittards&quot;*
I love and hate Keemstar, he is reasonable, but is also constantly looking for trouble, i feel its a good time now than ever to just stop doing drama alerts.<br>Drama is just boring these days and most 13 y/o girls argue about anything<br><br>I love the fact that basicly everyone hates him, i&#39;m sure he is a good friend, but he does not understand what boundaries are

don&#39;t care what anyone tells me. he killed Etika, i&#39;m grateful he&#39;s going
Keem seems to get to much hate the guy was ok and has been around for a decent portion of most of our live s
I didn&#39;t realize Keem was in his 40s... really strange that someone that age made a career out of following mostly teenage/early 20s drama.
Keemstar on YouTube is a plague<br>Keemstar on Twitter is a blessing<br>Know the difference

This Biden lover is retarded because he bring up how old the article is about qxc but fails to realize that speed is younger than qxc was when he said homophobic slur. Why does it matter how long ago it was it should only matter how old the person was and if they should know better
All these people commenting here about how keem is wrong about bringing up old articles and trying to prove that people do not change(which is just purely illogical point), it is clearly showing that u just don&#39;t want to accept the truth that xqc was wrong this time
Yeah but Keem wasn’t saying Xqc was homophobic. Like wtf? He was just saying that hey xqc you also used to participate in bad trash talk when you were younger but a 17 year old getting canceled over trash talk isn’t cool. <br>It’s funny because people hate Keemstar to the point where even when he’s in the right they can’t admit it because they have to hate him. I get it but come on, don’t make yourself look like a fool over it.
How many time does hasan say &quot;literally&quot; in this clip? It&#39;s like valley girl &quot;likes&quot; but way more annoying imo* I&#39;m not a destiny fan this is just truth. Now that u realize he overuses this word u will be annoyed
Keemstar doxed a family after calling a disabled kid named and bullshitted his way through Etika. His reach is terrible here.
Id prefer the 40 year old man arguing with teenagers about racism rather than dating them, unfortunately keem does both.
Xqc didnt say the f Word tho? What he did wasnt even that bad he just Said he would like to suck one which yea its inappropriate but its not comparable to the f Word
keep makes a point he said if you going at ishowspeed then keep the same energy
The fact that we care about grown ass men playing video games is crazy bruh ahahahahaha
Hassan and xqc are both liberal douches
He posted clips of him in RP? What a fucking weirdo
Next creator clash Hasan should fight Keem
keem took so many L&#39;s its sad
Keemsore really tried comparing a clip of xqc saying  “psshhh women. I’m kidding” and laughter…. To “IS A WOMAN TALKING TO ME RIGHT NOW? IS THAT A FUCKING FEMALE? GO WASH YOUR HUSBAND DISHES” 🤦🏽‍♀️ that guys head is the densest thing on earth
XQC vs Keemstar? Let&#39;s Go!
Didn’t iddubbs make a content cop where he even said that keem would go after a guy just because he talked in a negative way about him and keem is still doing it god hypocrisy is amazing
Also what xqc said wasn’t even that bad, people tell each other to suck a d all the time and he blurted it out without thinking about it while keenstar said the n word on purpose knowing that the player was black and he didn’t even care
they tried to use the way back machine for Joe Rogan too so
Holy shit this mf calling strangers lame on main someone cancel this fool
“Hassan reacts to Keemstar on QXC” …why? lol all clout demons trading gossip content for their communities🤣🤣
Hypcroite
I for one can barely understand what XQC, but his take here is perfect. change can always occur, and mostly its a good thing. but keemstar is acting like he&#39;s still in highschool, literally.
Who even watches that gnome anymore
Bro Keem is like 40 years old, anything he says or does on the internet is pure cringe
XQC was so smooth with that video. No nonsense, just a quick reminder to keemstar that he’s a piece of shit. Lmao
People need to mass drag Keemstar for all the things he has said and done
I thought keemstar was dead? Now he&#39;s desperate for more viewers so he starts drama w/ xqc. <b>That&#39;s every streamer logic to get famous.</b>
Keem is not a cool person ... guys its not cool to hate people too BUT sometimes it seems like Keem wants this hate and he gets it . But Why ? We should just ignore him and let his Social Media accounts die out
Keemstar is the last person id listen to about LGBTQ issues, no shot he actually cares lol (also I appreciate it when you put the chatter on the screen, makes it easier to follow)
actual good take
Keemstar saying no one cares about trash talking unless it&#39;s black streamers 👀 he&#39;s not wrong
mindset never changes but the way you act could
I&#39;m certain that the vocal minority of extremely annoying liberals might still be pissy about the past, but any rational leftist/feminist understands that teenagers say shit and that people mature overtime. It sometimes feels like this annoying and ultra American brand of &#39;woke liberals&#39; actively fight against any form of progress... I&#39;m sure that a younger XQC said a bunch of tasteless shit when he was a younger, rage-filled top player but I&#39;m proud of him for changing and growing and anyone with an earnest interest in seeing people change for the better would agree... seems like some people are only interested in having people to yell at.
imagine going back and showing clips of your bad moment when you have have done all of the shit that keem has done. god he is the worst of the worst, I really hope that this dosent die quick that way more people learn about keem and he gets called out and shit on by a hole new part of the internet
Keemstar has to be the pettiest  mf on the planet

Keem larping as Macho Man in the thumbnail 😂
Derpstar absolutely has no values. He shows it every day
XQC didn&#39;t answer Keemstar at all. Keemstar didn&#39;t want to show that XQC is a homophobe he just wanted to show that IShowSpeed was trash talking and isnt a sexist person on a day to day basis. Just like XQC years ago was not a homophobe but trash talked in a VIDEO GAME
I literally used lame to stop saying homophobic slurs. I’ll never stop saying the R word because I am r worded. That’s how it works right?
Yea xqc is the last guy I wanna hear from when it comes to all the women stereotype jokes
People are so sensitive nowadays bruh
hassan one of the biggest hypocrites? so speed trash talk, months ago apparently, and he admit he was in the wrong(lets not forgive)<br>xqc trash talks  years ago, admit he was wrong (lets forgive). make it make sense.not a fan of either xqc or speed dont watch their content, but logic doesnt aply to your comments and never will because u cant change hassan

Ok Dave, this is how streaming works in 2023.  When something like this happens, you DO let them call in because that&#39;s content that will draw people in to your stream.  Nobody wants to see a sad old man in a pikachu hate fail at games other than to laugh at how pathetic it all is.  The entire concept of your shit getting &quot;dErAiLeD!&quot; is obsolete.  This is a live stream, not some 2005 internet forum bro bro
Keem did state that if someone talk shit about him he talk shit back.
&quot;You&#39;re upset, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>Says a lot about your mentality when &quot;haha he&#39;s upset&quot; is the only conclusion you can come to when anyone criticizes you. Personally, I find Phil to be an interesting specimen of all the things to avoid doing in life to be happy or successful. Furthermore, the sheer amount of self-pignosis he&#39;s performed on himself to convince himself he&#39;s... well, anything more than garbage is shocking and awe-inspiring. I&#39;d think DSP would make a good case study for a lot of things. But even more brutally honest than that, I just find amusement in laughing at stupid people. And it&#39;d take some concentrated effort to be dumber than DSP.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not answering the phone. You can email me&quot;<br><br>Yea, this is just ridiculous. This pretentious bullshit is why he couldn&#39;t do anything about the condo. He thinks sitting on his ass playing video games is more important than financial responsibility. FWIW, I don&#39;t like Keem either. Guy seems like a two-faced cunt-waffle with an atrocious beard. However, I can agree with Keem and Craig - This is how you do business in this sphere. Keem&#39;s not entirely out of line by doing this shit publicly on Twitter. The fact that DSP has been at this for over a decade and still refuses to acknowledge this or change is a sign of his own stupidity.<br><br>God, this guy can be tiring to listen to. Imagine getting tired of hearing someone. Amazing.
All that Keem wanted to do was help him. He turned down a $50k offer because he has a personal grudge against Keem, yet he respects him as a businessman. Strange guy.
Yeah ngl....not trusting keem is probably the only thing i can&#39;t hold against Dave.<br>That guy is the slimiest mf on the platfrom.

&quot;i&#39;m booked&quot; xD
Such a pathetic manipulator.  He&#39;s so smug and confident when it&#39;s just him and his webcam, but when he&#39;s having a live conversation he&#39;s polite and obsequious.  Which is the real Phil?  We all know...
Why Phil? Man you&#39;re the biggest Lolcow on the internet! That&#39;s not a title earned so easily!
He&#39;s never once made a whole video crapping on Keem? When Keem retired, when Keem responded to you, you crap on him all the time. Then again this is DSP and semantics are his best friend because the whole video wasn&#39;t about that, even though a good chunk of it was.
He&#39;s so petty man. You can tell he wants to ban Keem so bad lmao
What Keemstar doesn’t understand is that Phil is a mahture adult with a business doing business stuff! Sound good?
Phil when Sidescrollers talk about him: “They talk about me WITH ME NOT BEING THERE <b>SNORT</b> it’s not right, blah blah *SNORT*”<br><br>Phil when he talks about Keemstar: “Why do you care? <b>SNORT</b> omg! SOO WEIRD!! Why do you care if I talk about you when you’re not there? Te hehe!”
I thought keemstar retired with &quot;fuck you money&quot; Is he that desperate for attention?
DSP on Monday = “ I am the most prolific gaming streamer “<br>DSP on Tuesday = “ I am a nobody, why do you care?”
The hypocrisy is insane. Gotta love Phil discovering the joys of being a Keemstar detractor though. Let&#39;s do a quick post mortem on Phil&#39;s interview; He provided no proof of his innocence, he turned at least two very fair-minded people against him, he embarrassed himself to thousands of people(nothing new there), he gave Keem exactly what he wanted and now on top of that he now holds the same opinion of Keem that Phil&#39;s detractors hold on him. His pathetic attempt at trolling is almost precious.
He rarely talks about you Phil. You&#39;re irrelevant especially in the real world. So the one time he talks about you it&#39;s all the time? Dsp talks about Keem much more and craps on him for no reason unprovoked. Dudes a hypocrite
He really thinks Keem cares about what he thinks of him. He wants to know why you are the way you are. That&#39;s it. DSP is a nobody. And Keem is gonna dig up his past with an excavator. He will wave that 50k at people from Philburts past and they WILL talk.
Phil has stated what someone does on Twitter has nothing to do with his stream.
DSP is sweating and Keem&#39;s got new realistate in his mind
I feel like this guy should wear that bear hat or raccoon hat from RDR 2 while talking with this amount of chest lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want the documentary to be made, I want more people to fuck with phil until he runs outside in a pikachu hat to yell at imaginary trolls.
He&#39;s gonna make a doc, not talk to Keem when he asks for an interview, and then get mad that Keem didn&#39;t talk to him for his documentary.
One thing i swear 1000% is coming from this whole amazing sidescrollers interview.. PHIL IS GETTING AUDITED THIS YEAR lol.. the man said his tax guy writes off his medical expenses and entire mortgage and association fees when he files EVERY YEAR.. that&#39;s tax fraud.. i&#39;m shocked  he hasn&#39;t been audited yet and the IRS had a HISTORICAL bump in financial support this year so get ready for problems phil. BET ON IT
So he calls pretty much everyone on the Internet shills, muppets and all that stupid shit and he&#39;s surprised someone talks shit back at him?
the smugness is unreal
Phil’s new thang:<br>“With all do respect, I’m going to be very nice when I say this…”<br>Then proceeds to shit on people
DSP trying to be a big hard man on his stream to a faceless chatter. He cant even pick up a call nor could he tell the truth of what he thinks about keemstar on the SS podcast. He tried to say he respects keemstar or some nonsense haha. Its all about power with DSP, his attitude here shows it. He loves the idea that he can just ban keemstar on stream and he loves pointing out any grammar errors. Hes trying to make keemstar look bad. Its unreal haha. DSP looking and acting like an absolute child
I like these interactions between Phil and Keem because we get to see a genuine emotion from Phil that&#39;s not an act.
Funny he corrects keems typo meanwhile jade goes gdjdlfbsgan and phil reads it perfectly
Keem has connections. Perhaps he can get the IRS to finally audit this pig.
What could go wrong ?<br>Oh wait it&#39;s dsp <br><br>Here we go again .....
He really thinks he&#39;s owning Keem.  A man who has literal millions over Phil
Keemstar will fuck him up.Bro is mad and has power and money Piggy is done.
Please email me first, but email me on my yahoo email account
He acts so big behind his pikachu hat, where was his balls in the interrogation?
I understand why DSP doesn’t trust Keem but it’s also totally stupid to not take the views and exposure that having him on his channel would create.
DSP is in charge over at his stream. Listen to him and follow the king’s law. Or get ban
I wish keemstar was focusing on wings of redemption TBH. That guy is a straight up PDF and deserves everything he gets
Piggy is so tough in his gated community behind a camera. As much as I hate Keemstar, he&#39;s infinitely more successful and at least he isn&#39;t afraid to come out of his house.",PT8M26S,0.9913

I never got why he got so much h8 dude been on yt since day1 bk when it was grimey af hes been having a mid life crisis 4 a deacade ... thats impressive
I laugh so hard at the Keem impression, “IIIAAM BEEEEING STAAABED”! My ribs hurt!😂
The diss is fire though 🔥 👌
Ego rythm? Who is she? Ew. Barf on her shoes.
This idiot saying he&#39;s &#39;on call&#39; to youtube like a healthcare/emergency worker makes me angry. I have a family member who works in a healthcare facility and is on call even on days off so we can barely spend time with them if at all and it&#39;s really stressful for them but this little garbage gremlin uses the term like it&#39;s the same thing

crazy how leos song sounds better than a lot of popular music today.
If I get a pie for my birthday I will do Keemstar&#39;s fast as f boi once a week for as long as possible.<br><br>I&#39;m no one special. I just didn&#39;t get a pie last year. Not even a cake. <br>˙ˆ˙<br><br><br><br>Also your Keemstar voice is so close it could fool me if I didn&#39;t expect it.
But this diss track fuckin slappsss thooo wttttffff
I agree with Many of the things he said but sometimes keem goes overboard, like with what he did to that old man, like these times it truly feels like he&#39;s heartless and hypocritical and that&#39;s what makes me not respect him
Daaaaaamn Leo, the song was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Mad how u gained over 2k in like a week since I first found your channel, proud of u wtf 😖
According to Keemstar, it&#39;s cool to date 12 year old children as long as they enjoy the movie JAWS.......
Leo, you don&#39;t need to weaponize your followers to attack him.....the dude is already a loser. Also, going by his logic. It would be ok for him to date a 13 year old as long as they enjoy the movie JAWS.........
This wasn’t a diss track… this was a fucking crime scene… that man has to be dead now.
Yknow I watched a recent stream that keem was on, and it got a bit off topic and he actually said that he wants to sell DramaAlert (and has a couple takers) but he wants to sell it for a good amount of money.
Mans retirement didn&#39;t last all that long.
I can&#39;t understand the lyrics at the end because the instrumentals are way too loud need better mixing.
Holy shit that track was dope
great video and you are a great singer.... wow amazing
A summer jam
The worst part about him should be that partycity beard but here we are.
🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
The diss track went harder then his whole career.
That Dis track was fire &lt;3 Unlike keemstar, good riddance to bad rubbish.<br> No girl would be into that with out cash as incentive. XD
Keemstar only gets along with girls half his age because he&#39;s intellectuality stunted...
Gotta say, your impression of him sounds like him doing an impression of Seinfeld.
Gotta say, for a guy who&#39;s 40, he sounds like the biggest boomer, whining about cancel culture. Bro you&#39;re the second hand Joe Rogan. Actually, he&#39;s probably leaving because his entire thing is being cannibalized by bigger, more popular, more bitter people than him.
I can&#39;t wait to see DILF Leo
I would genuinely recommend Leafy as his replacement!<br>Either that or Scarce.<br>Or James Corden......
BARS!
It would be nightmare too man
Bro that diss was so fire.
I’ve been bingeing your channel. Thank you Leo! Damn, you are a gem. Keep it up, you deserve what you want to have ❤️
yooo this diss trackkk
You got me wheeze laughing subbed I hope your channel grows for a long time to come
Oh my god the old guy almost crying on stream broke my heart
I don&#39;t like Ethan. He&#39;s arguably worst than Keemstar
You def bodied this song Big Baby
He just upset cuz he doesn&#39;t fit in this new age of YouTube. I think this is another great time in YouTube. Its a time where intelligence is super important these days an it makes for some beautiful content. Less morons is a good thing, I&#39;m the same age as this jackass. I&#39;ve unfortunately had to deal with that fact. I&#39;m the same age as squeamstar, an our views are Nothing alike. What a fucking boomer.
took me 6 months to see these 🔥 bars
that song of yours was awesome ,great dis track for real
I like news
Keemstar is a rare example of real person who suffers from crippling Flanderization. If he were a sitcom character, people who be writing to the network have his character &quot;killed off&quot;, &quot;put on the bus&quot; or &quot;have him return to his home planet&quot;.

We all know that this video is going to be interesting to watch okay
Lol
Well that didn&#39;t last long
The Internet superpowers have joined up? History repeats.
and they say Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover ever
Ignoring the hypocrisy oh Logan’s statement, wishing for someone’s mother’s fucking funeral to be swatted by police for a false bomb threat is disgusting. Wishing for people’s children to be harassed is disgusting. This dude Logan has something wrong with him
If there&#39;s anyone that makes sense for them to unite against its Logan he&#39;s like the black sheep of popular you tubers and I don&#39;t feel sorry for him at all

Haven&#39;t watched the video yet, but what if...<br>What if Ethan, and Keemstar&#39;s public feud has been THE MOST MASSIVE TROLLING IN HISTORY?! <br>Probably not, but that would actually be f***ing hilarious.
The mid-rolls doe
This is the moment Walt became Heisenberg.
it&#39;s castle itter all over again
The only people Keem and Ethan hate more than eachother; the Pauls.
This must be what Britain and France felt like after the 7 year war<br><br>But yeah lets be honest, Nobody likes logan paul, he is probably the more Edgy and Cringeworthy person on the planet, but i feel that&#39;s more of a complement to his Massive Ego.
This is the biggest video game cross over of all time
Funny. Apart, I despise both of them. But together? Not as much. I mean, I still hate them, but at least they&#39;re doing something productive together.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
after all this time of being maked fun of... now its finally happening!<br><br>Keemstar x H3H3 is real
Not sure if LOGAN PAUL is allowed to make any judgment...
Humanity is doomed because of complete MELTS like these
People who remember when Keem and Bashur teamed up: Why does this seem so familiar

Hey bowblax can you stop removing my comments .<br>Like I know that you hate freedom of speech when it comes down to calling out H3H3 on their BS in the past .<br>But common .<br>Maybe they will remove you videos up next.
Give them a week .<br>Keem or H3 will find a way to hate one another for no reason .
Logan should beat them the hell up , they so annoying like fr
This is like the meme of the two burly guys holding hands. Goes to show that when one commentary channel gets canceled everyone jumps on him. However when two of them get cancelled then no one can stop them.
this is a weird episode of Centricide
no he missed the chance to say &quot;all i needed was a bite of beef but logan gave me the whole cow.&quot;
Bro that laugh at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-9e8_GFsK0&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a> O_o
For once I will side with the gnome
Logan wasn’t saying “ go harrass them” he was like why romanatwood, why him? Why not someone like h3h3 or keem, he never said he wants that to happen to anyone, he was simply confused as to why roman got that but not someone who’s well hated on tje internet like h3h3 or keem
I know h3h3 has the title for being the biggest hypocrite (correct me if I’m wrong on that) but I think Logan just took that title from him.
2 enemsy teaming up to take on a same threat is anime 101
They aren&#39;t teaming up
Why have I not seen one reference to the suicide forest
Don&#39;t like any of these people
&quot;2 old men team up agains an internet dumbass&quot;
didnt think keem knew he had kids
pretty funny to hear logan paul call anyone scum 😂
This is totally off-topic but I’m gonna say this anyways. If you’re willing to go to the level of harassing somebody by turning off the fucking power grid, sending bomb threats at a funeral, and hacking their security cameras knowing that there’s kids in the house… You deserve to be doxxed yourself. You deserve to have all of your private information leaked to the public. What these people did is fucking disgusting because they put his life in danger and his kids lives, so these people intern should be put in danger themselves. They do not deserve any privacy at all.
Might be time for Logan to visit that Japanese Forrest again, but not as a tourist..
They should go after KeemStar. He&#39;s been responsible for harassment of other creators he didn&#39;t like, just like the stuff he&#39;s saying is hidious. Honestly hope someone shuts off his power so he can&#39;t record shitty videos anymore.
Did keemstar confess to murder or am I just missing something? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-9e8_GFsK0&amp;t=4m06s"">4:06</a>
Love how they&#39;re laughing at keep on that podcast but... why they booing? He&#39;s right.
I mean if they legit teamed up.  They would be pretty powerful.  Im not a fan of either of them... but its like if thanos and magneto teamed up to destroy the world

also I would like to state that both me and papa gut where right, months after he posted he was going to &quot;retire&quot; he then posted a video saying he wasn&#39;t again. We all knew he said this for views, and that video was one of the highest viewed video on his channel at the time, it was pure bait.
I remember seeing that video awhile, glad you saw it, keemstar over here &quot;I interviewed one of carson&#39;s friends with their story&quot; <br>this is how disingenuous keemstar is:<br><br>Noah hugbox(the person who keemstar interviewed) had stated on a halo stream a long long time ago, stated that keemstar came to him asking for a interview, not the other way around. Keemstar is being very dishonest in  acting as if people came to him, which is clearly not the case as we know keemstar went out of his way to report on this story, and from what happened with crow of judgement, and papa gut, keem also went out of his way to try and discredit them and anyone else trying to report on the story with a different perspective because he was on a nobody you tuber video trying to discredit someone who had just a mere 2k or so views.<br><br>but yea keemstar always seems to get upset when someone criticizes him, he can deal it out but he can&#39;t take it.  The fact he is letting small time streamers/youtubers  get to him, who no offense to papa gut are less known and relevant than him is hilarious to me.
they&#39;re the saltiest group of people ever
Papa Gut ain&#39;t even a huge leftist. 😂
He’s blaming you for his failing channel?
Lol.. they called you a leftist.. 😂🤣☠️.. is there a way to have the search big gump bring up your YouTube channel?<br>Side note: I’ve watched papa for a couple years now, and the reason why he is one of the only ones I sub to on twitch and watch on YouTube is because he appreciates his viewers. He knows what it takes for every dollar we earn and he is genuinely grateful.
Love you big gump
Love your channel fat gump 💀 (legit I love ur channel tho and this is hilarious)
You know you were right in your video when the main thing he addressed was u just calling his job easy🤣 pathetic
Love your content, Big Gump
Keemstar wouldn&#39;t survive in a 9-5 job. He&#39;s such a loser.
I&#39;m &quot;working&quot;. No you aren&#39;t keemstar.
Thank you for admitting how little work is involved in being a streamer or Youtuber. Because so many of them act like it&#39;s harder than a 9-5 job.
Papa you should name your alter ego fat gump 😂
Oh this is what I was talking about lmao I was in that live stream and everybody was intrigued by Papa Gut’s name
I watch your content becayse its real and nuetral, its not fake, you dont lie or add anything into it and your thinking what we all are thinking, i think that there are some comentators that go way to overbored about shit like keemstar.. hes a liar, hes annoying.. and he lowkey is for sexual assault. Atleast papa gut is real and has good morals tbh
change your channel name to fat gump for like a week
Leftists hating you is a pretty solid indicator you are a leftist. I know. I am a leftist.

Keem seems awful! He has no one to blame but himself for the way adults react to his behavior. I can&#39;t believe he just sits around his house watching random videos about himself.
Not Keemstar calling someone fat, while looking like a garden gnome!! Lol
&#39;fat gump make dump!&#39; there i just gave you a new catchphrase. your welcome
His point was that you’re jumping to manufacture outrage over anything he says. Sort of what the quartering does
Big gump
We love Big Gump. He might be over the top leftist, but he&#39;s our Big Gump.
I love these types of dudes who call everyone sensitive slowflakes flip the fuck out when someone calls their job hard lol
Keemstars been crying about YouTube since 2017. Also keem doesn’t know the difference between being a leftist and being a liberal
Kopestar still cries about trump losing lol. What a dork
It’s hilarious right before this he’s saying for sure it was a troll
Keemstar calling someone else corny is fucking ironic
ur not wrong but carson actually deserved to be canceled theres more to the story

Keemstar is absolutely right here. Admittedly Keemstar is a scumbag, especially when it comes to Tony Ray. But TheQuartering is basically a Anti-SJW SJW who starts drama at the drop of a hat.
The quarterpounder at it again 😂
Remember when thequartering had beef with darkviperau
Keem star is cringe
Sometimes you pause way too often, you haven&#39;t even finished reading a tweet before you pause and trial off topic for too long, im like 15 minutes in and you hadn&#39;t even read the tweets that the video is about. Just saying, still enjoy your content.
Surprisingly I actually agree with keemstar. Here is the thing. I don&#39;t like either of them for multiple reasons. Like I&#39;m not saying that  to seem less biased but actually I&#39;m a fan of one them type of shit.<br>I generally do not like either of them.<br><br>But just because you don&#39;t call for a person to be fired or lose anything because you disagree with them. That doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t have the same effect that people associate with cancel culture.<br><br>I just see it as being dishonest at worst and at best a issue with the definition and perspective of cancel culture. They define it as only being one sided and that&#39;s by design because it&#39;s a political term now. When it becomes political you have to be on one side. There is no nuance anymore.<br><br>When I think about cancel culture. It&#39;s been around for decades in some form or another. Boycotting is essentially cancel culture. You are calling for people to stop using a product or service because of something they say or do.<br>But we don&#39;t look at boycotting the same as cancel culture. But the results are the same.<br><br>When you boycott of company they lose money and depending on the reason for the boycott. People can lose their jobs because they aren&#39;t bringing in the same amout of money. If it&#39;s a slogan, commercial, or a campaign promotion that sparks the outrage that lead to the boycott usually if the company buckles under the pressure. The person in charge of that can be anything from made to apologize to being fired.<br><br><br>At the end of the day the quartering is doing essentially that. Cancel culture. He has no idea the actor even knows about the man being a pedophile. He doesn&#39;t know if that&#39;s even the motivation behind the post. But he makes sure to make it sound like that in his tweet. Then provides to call anyone who disagrees with him &quot;pro pedophile&quot; dispite the fact that keemstar literally did not make any statement about pedophilia. Who does that sound like? Could be a sjw who the quartering has made a career off of shiting on?<br><br>Ijs the whole thing is dumb but it&#39;s because the whole idea of cancel culture is lead by people who have a political bias.
Can&#39;t believe you missed the part where quartering pissed in his sink
My take when I saw this on Twitter is as follows:<br>You can be anti cancel culture and pro speak with your wallet without being contradictory or a hypocrite.

I’f Keem is Batman, Ethan would be the Joke, Hasan would be the Riddler, and The Quartering would be Professor Pyg

You need to learn more about the Quartering, he’s one of those conservative youtubers who say they hate the Leftwing hate mobs but then makes videos perpetuating hate towards people like Bri Larson, Naughty Dog, and other’s that tend to be more progressive. He and other youtubers like him blindly hate without knowing what they are hating on. Instead of them making actual criticisms they all say the same virtue signally lines as each other.
Fully agree about your take on the mandalorian. Star Wars  is jedi vs sith to me I don’t care about bounty hunters
Chances of the Pedro tweet being from a manager or something is high since he hasn’t spoken on it  as much really.<br><br><br><br>Either way it was yikes but also not really pro pedo which was some watered down weak ass pasta sauce.
The Mandalorian slander…👀🤭
The Mandalorian is trash. All new Star wars is trash.
Can we get them in a Cage match? I&#39;m broke but I&#39;d somehow find a way to help fund it. Would be the funniest thing ever
Both of them suck. Keem is probably a bit worse though....probably
The baby yoda take was so bad I literally want to unsubscribe from the stupidity
Mandalorian is amazing. Unsubbing.
Keem is such a…. Baby
I hate, hate, hate to say this but...Keem is right on this one. Even the quivering&#39;s response to calling him a pro pedo is weak sauce, the only thing that the the quivering had was ratio-ing Keem and in that regard...Keem&#39;s reaction was hilariously butthurt. <br><br>But overall, I think Keem was right.<br><br>Both are just mad they are past their prime and slowly passing into irrelevancy lol
That&#39;s why I hate socialists. Pedophiles need only one kind of help: physical castration without anesthesia and the death penalty. There is no cure or anything like that for them. () Xanderhall another who thinks that pedophiles can be &quot;helped&quot;, considers a model of treatment, such as that pedophiles go to a clinic and empty their balls by watching child pornography videos. I don&#39;t know where this clinic is, (what country I mean), but if it were in my country I would have every doctor who works in that clinic arrested for possession and distribution of child pornography, I would emasculate them, and I would put them in some dark forgotten prison. from God. I&#39;m sorry if they have been abused, but we CANNOT run the risk of them going around free. I&#39;m sorry but: 1 - They are not curable 2 - They have three choices in my opinion: to be physically sterilized or to be shot, or to have their brains fried until they become vegetables, with electric shocks. The excuse of they need help, let&#39;s leave it for people who really need help (aka the victims of these beings, and no I don&#39;t care if they haven&#39;t &quot;offended&quot; anyone yet, the mere fact that they possibly consume child pornography makes them executioners).
I have to state my opinion here, The Mandalorian was one of the best shows I&#39;ve seen a while.
the quartering is one of the biggest babies on the platorm
The amount of time he says &quot;grown man&quot; reminds me of how crazy people always say &quot;I&#39;m not crazy&quot; <br>We get it. You&#39;re grown. Who are you trying to convince? Good lord.
That’s how the quartering always is I had to stop watching him because he’s like a man child
you didn’t LIKE the mandalorian but saying it’s bad is just objectively wrong lol. makes me question your other takes when you lump one in like this that’s off topic and ignorant bro, cmon Gut.<br>i don’t even like star wars
Karenstar inserting himself into something that doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t involve him? no way
these dudes are adults man...
Ethan Klein is the penguin
TheQuartering and Keemstar 2 of the biggest pricks out there
gut give us some good shows to watch, mention some in the next youtube vid!
papa what do you MEAN you dont like the mandalorian ??
Gonna have to unfollow. Your commentary on Kyle is ignorant. Have fun with your audience ending up with only edge lords.
Lol u petty for that “it’s a 9-5 job 😂
The Mandalorian is actually good and you are wrong. Straight to bad-take jail.
Just dropped a dislike bc you dissed not only the mandalorian but DADDY PEDRO PASCAL TOO. This is inexcusable Dan, I will see to it myself that your vocalization of opinions privilege is revoked
That mandolorian take was terrible
Keem is right lol. TQ knew what he was doing by mentioning Disney+ and Starwars..
Anyone else peep aba and prech “pause” 😭😭
ADHD people never grow up &amp; they will always be impulsive &amp; wanting instant gratification
I guess I don&#39;t see saying RIP as glorifying a pedo. SOMEONE loves that person and their death was probably hard for them. I in NO WAY am excusing the actions. At all. But I didn&#39;t see glorification.
Ask Republican and currently being interrogated for sex traffic, Matt Gaetz how Republicans...really hate child predators. Smh
I dunno papa I don’t think we can get past this dude beating his partner…. Child rapist is horrible but beating your wife is also kinda bad
The quartering is how the guy gets in the bed because all at once he is to heavy. Hahahhahahajhahahah you put your left arm on then your left leg followed by the right leg as you fling your body bout hahahhahaha
&quot;mandalorian was mediocre&quot;, fastest unsubbed ever
OK missed opportunity to add purple hair and a purple beard to keem after the comparison lol <br><br> 😆🤣😂

"DSP Is Mad at Keemstar, Again... Talks About a Podcast Together","CREDITS
Intro: @LeonLush - Views
https://youtu.be/oVuUjW6XIm8
Mr. Views animation:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChElCg1E0jnVz9Pbv7JJsZQ",12843,442,259,2022-06-27T23:01:49Z,"&quot;I&#39;d rather beg and pester you for money endlessly than have a phone call with Keem (that might have landed me 50k).&quot; Wow, it&#39;s like he really expects the handful of people that give him money regularly to stick around for the next twenty years at least.
Already botched the lie. He never said he was going to be on, but he offered it
This man turn down 50k. Think about that.
Phil is so pathetic.
This is just like on Jan 6th when Keem was crying about nick fuentes the whole day lol
I think DSP is right in these situations.
Gotta love how low IQ Phil burns bridges with everybody and continues to beg for 50 dollars a day lmao he&#39;s so ridiculous.
DSP, if you really are in financial ruins and were in desperate need of money, the smart thing to do would have been to be on the podcast.  Grow a set, I mean keemstar has had a dodgy past but still wtf my guy
So when people &quot;make shit up&quot; about Phil on the internet, he expects anyone to check the facts. But when he hears about what Keemstar might have done, he doesn&#39;t even want to have anything to do with him.
Pᵣₒmₒˢᵐ
&quot;Keemstar is worse than me&quot;<br>&gt;gets caught yanking it on stream&lt;
Let&#39;s be honest: If Keemstar contacted DSP, he&#39;d ignore him anyhow...
Phil should feel lucky that anyone attempted to have a business relationship with him.
&quot;I ignored it&quot; Also DSP &quot;I never got any offer or heard about it&quot;
DSP has to be THE MOST pathetic man alive.
Exactly!! If someone rejects a $50K check bc they don’t want to talk to someone on the phone, then they clearly don’t have financial issues, and this shows his lies when it comes to his begging for tips.
He has the comprehension and emotional intelligence of an 8 year old.
TLDR: dsp is stupid, does something stupid. Costs himself 50k
I know these are old clips but f*k this guy. He is in no position talking down to people like that.<br><br>EDIT: Phil, you&#39;ve seriously could&#39;ve just said &quot;No and I&#39;m not interested&quot; instead of dicking around with Keem. Also, why don&#39;t you call Keem when you&#39;re free. Your logic makes no sense.
DSP is always busy, his streams is all about money stops to do the top dono superchat you deraill your own stream to read a message that talks about your cat. this is the reason no sponsors will touch him. If they see this now they wont work with him if he does call me at this time OKAY only or send me the text. No when its business related its threw a call so everything can be set n recorded. Nobody will trust him to write back.
He sure talks tough.
“ORGANIC GROWTH” lol
In all honesty, Keem was probably hoping DSP would answer during stream to see if Phil would be the man he pretends to be; Telling Keem he isn&#39;t interested w/o being able to control the narrative of how everything happened. <br><br>Phil would never say he hates Keem if he could respond w/o Phil&#39;s filter.
With Phil you must feed his ego and give him money. Both in the same time. Definition of pig roach!
I hope that’s the last keem or anyone else will try to help DarkSydeBegger that man is truly living garbage.
Remember to squeeze banana phil. Oops the camera&#39;s on.
Anyone Notice That Phil Haircut Taking the paint off the Walls?? Soon Phil Needs Tips to paint his Room lol
One of the most pathetic moments in lolcock history
The begging would continue to Phil&#39;s deathbed. Nothing can stop him.
Keemstar is just trying to exploit dsp like everyone else including this channel. No show was ever in the cards.
Is this the only detractor channel left?
What happened to that cult of hate channel
You&#39;d think Phil, a guy who&#39;s been a content creator for over 12 years, would know that views don&#39;t mean anything without any retention
Dsp is as pathetic as pathetic can get. His begging was in jeopardy so he did what unintelligent human beings do when they have no intelligent response, insult the other person by using a bunch of profanity and name calling. Hopefully the podcast moves on with someone else and all those guys make good money and dsps viewers money dries up and he has to get a regular job.
Thanks for telling us that you want to beg to your denthead wheelchairs for the rest of your life like you have already told us years ago.
How many YouTube people struggling would take that money and do it ? Keemstar is trying to help him and DSP is too stupid judging from this. Like he can&#39;t take a call at a certain time or the world of streaming will end.
&quot;His reputation is far worse than mine would ever be&quot; Yet Keem has f-you money and you rake in only 21 bucks during that rant. Pro beggars don&#39;t have pride, Boyo, it doesn&#39;t work that way.
All he has to do is make up 5 more 1MM and he&#39;ll make $250 a night
Phil constantly begs for money and views, but won&#39;t accept a money making deal?
Look I hate Keem because he&#39;s a terrible human and for all the drama he was in, but....................50k is 50k lol
How to lose 50k in one ban
This old delusional shcizo bum literally is full of excuses lol!
Good on DSP for having values and morals
DSP turning down 50k just goes to show he has money. He just still begs.
I don&#39;t ever want to hear him whine bout not being able to pay his bills to guilt trip people into donating again. He had a golden opportunity and blew it.
I am not a children&#39;s entertainer 🍌squeeze banana
Moron fumbled the bag for the other two involved as well.  I&#39;d be pissed if I were Wings or Boogie
Wow DSP didn&#39;t want $50.000🤔🤦🏻‍♂️🤣😂😳🤯
He&#39;s soooo professional.<br><br>Too stupid...says the guy stuck on level 1.
Pretty sure I lost all my brain cells listening to Phil’s logic and explanation",PT9M59S,-0.9639

Ok Dave, this is how streaming works in 2023.  When something like this happens, you DO let them call in because that&#39;s content that will draw people in to your stream.  Nobody wants to see a sad old man in a pikachu hate fail at games other than to laugh at how pathetic it all is.  The entire concept of your shit getting &quot;dErAiLeD!&quot; is obsolete.  This is a live stream, not some 2005 internet forum bro bro
Keem did state that if someone talk shit about him he talk shit back.
&quot;You&#39;re upset, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>Says a lot about your mentality when &quot;haha he&#39;s upset&quot; is the only conclusion you can come to when anyone criticizes you. Personally, I find Phil to be an interesting specimen of all the things to avoid doing in life to be happy or successful. Furthermore, the sheer amount of self-pignosis he&#39;s performed on himself to convince himself he&#39;s... well, anything more than garbage is shocking and awe-inspiring. I&#39;d think DSP would make a good case study for a lot of things. But even more brutally honest than that, I just find amusement in laughing at stupid people. And it&#39;d take some concentrated effort to be dumber than DSP.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not answering the phone. You can email me&quot;<br><br>Yea, this is just ridiculous. This pretentious bullshit is why he couldn&#39;t do anything about the condo. He thinks sitting on his ass playing video games is more important than financial responsibility. FWIW, I don&#39;t like Keem either. Guy seems like a two-faced cunt-waffle with an atrocious beard. However, I can agree with Keem and Craig - This is how you do business in this sphere. Keem&#39;s not entirely out of line by doing this shit publicly on Twitter. The fact that DSP has been at this for over a decade and still refuses to acknowledge this or change is a sign of his own stupidity.<br><br>God, this guy can be tiring to listen to. Imagine getting tired of hearing someone. Amazing.
All that Keem wanted to do was help him. He turned down a $50k offer because he has a personal grudge against Keem, yet he respects him as a businessman. Strange guy.
Yeah ngl....not trusting keem is probably the only thing i can&#39;t hold against Dave.<br>That guy is the slimiest mf on the platfrom.
The arrogance...
Hes like that asshole person everyone knows that always has to have the upper hand in a conversation.
Why is he like this? Just drop the ego and talk ffs.
manchild who can&#39;t get another man&#39;s name out of his fucking mouth: &quot;WOW, YOU&#39;RE LIKE OBSESSED WITH ME&quot;
All the people in this chat are just judgmental and dumb a holes and worse than Phil
Keem, I’m booked dood. I can’t derail the stream to have a topical conversation thousands might tune in to see. I’ve got clips of Chocolate Rain and Charlie bit my finger waiting for my epic, totally real reack ack acks.
<b>makes fun of the dude that offered him 50k</b><br><b>Proceeds to beg</b>
Worth your wild? 😂😂😂😂
&quot;i&#39;m booked&quot; xD
Such a pathetic manipulator.  He&#39;s so smug and confident when it&#39;s just him and his webcam, but when he&#39;s having a live conversation he&#39;s polite and obsequious.  Which is the real Phil?  We all know...
Why Phil? Man you&#39;re the biggest Lolcow on the internet! That&#39;s not a title earned so easily!
He&#39;s never once made a whole video crapping on Keem? When Keem retired, when Keem responded to you, you crap on him all the time. Then again this is DSP and semantics are his best friend because the whole video wasn&#39;t about that, even though a good chunk of it was.
He&#39;s so petty man. You can tell he wants to ban Keem so bad lmao
What Keemstar doesn’t understand is that Phil is a mahture adult with a business doing business stuff! Sound good?
Phil when Sidescrollers talk about him: “They talk about me WITH ME NOT BEING THERE <b>SNORT</b> it’s not right, blah blah *SNORT*”<br><br>Phil when he talks about Keemstar: “Why do you care? <b>SNORT</b> omg! SOO WEIRD!! Why do you care if I talk about you when you’re not there? Te hehe!”
I thought keemstar retired with &quot;fuck you money&quot; Is he that desperate for attention?
DSP on Monday = “ I am the most prolific gaming streamer “<br>DSP on Tuesday = “ I am a nobody, why do you care?”
The hypocrisy is insane. Gotta love Phil discovering the joys of being a Keemstar detractor though. Let&#39;s do a quick post mortem on Phil&#39;s interview; He provided no proof of his innocence, he turned at least two very fair-minded people against him, he embarrassed himself to thousands of people(nothing new there), he gave Keem exactly what he wanted and now on top of that he now holds the same opinion of Keem that Phil&#39;s detractors hold on him. His pathetic attempt at trolling is almost precious.
He rarely talks about you Phil. You&#39;re irrelevant especially in the real world. So the one time he talks about you it&#39;s all the time? Dsp talks about Keem much more and craps on him for no reason unprovoked. Dudes a hypocrite
He really thinks Keem cares about what he thinks of him. He wants to know why you are the way you are. That&#39;s it. DSP is a nobody. And Keem is gonna dig up his past with an excavator. He will wave that 50k at people from Philburts past and they WILL talk.
Phil has stated what someone does on Twitter has nothing to do with his stream.
DSP is sweating and Keem&#39;s got new realistate in his mind
I feel like this guy should wear that bear hat or raccoon hat from RDR 2 while talking with this amount of chest lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want the documentary to be made, I want more people to fuck with phil until he runs outside in a pikachu hat to yell at imaginary trolls.
He&#39;s gonna make a doc, not talk to Keem when he asks for an interview, and then get mad that Keem didn&#39;t talk to him for his documentary.
One thing i swear 1000% is coming from this whole amazing sidescrollers interview.. PHIL IS GETTING AUDITED THIS YEAR lol.. the man said his tax guy writes off his medical expenses and entire mortgage and association fees when he files EVERY YEAR.. that&#39;s tax fraud.. i&#39;m shocked  he hasn&#39;t been audited yet and the IRS had a HISTORICAL bump in financial support this year so get ready for problems phil. BET ON IT
So he calls pretty much everyone on the Internet shills, muppets and all that stupid shit and he&#39;s surprised someone talks shit back at him?
the smugness is unreal
Phil’s new thang:<br>“With all do respect, I’m going to be very nice when I say this…”<br>Then proceeds to shit on people
DSP trying to be a big hard man on his stream to a faceless chatter. He cant even pick up a call nor could he tell the truth of what he thinks about keemstar on the SS podcast. He tried to say he respects keemstar or some nonsense haha. Its all about power with DSP, his attitude here shows it. He loves the idea that he can just ban keemstar on stream and he loves pointing out any grammar errors. Hes trying to make keemstar look bad. Its unreal haha. DSP looking and acting like an absolute child
I like these interactions between Phil and Keem because we get to see a genuine emotion from Phil that&#39;s not an act.
Funny he corrects keems typo meanwhile jade goes gdjdlfbsgan and phil reads it perfectly
Keem has connections. Perhaps he can get the IRS to finally audit this pig.
What could go wrong ?<br>Oh wait it&#39;s dsp <br><br>Here we go again .....
He really thinks he&#39;s owning Keem.  A man who has literal millions over Phil
Keemstar will fuck him up.Bro is mad and has power and money Piggy is done.
Please email me first, but email me on my yahoo email account
He acts so big behind his pikachu hat, where was his balls in the interrogation?
I understand why DSP doesn’t trust Keem but it’s also totally stupid to not take the views and exposure that having him on his channel would create.
DSP is in charge over at his stream. Listen to him and follow the king’s law. Or get ban
I wish keemstar was focusing on wings of redemption TBH. That guy is a straight up PDF and deserves everything he gets
Piggy is so tough in his gated community behind a camera. As much as I hate Keemstar, he&#39;s infinitely more successful and at least he isn&#39;t afraid to come out of his house.",PT8M26S,0.9913

Love how Keemstar doesn&#39;t understand people put their pronouns in their bio because... They wanna tell people their gender? So that they can use the right pronouns in Twitter conversations?<br><br>Love him.
I like how keem was probably drunk and decided to troll
Keem is a legend. He is literally the best thing twitter ever had lmfao
since i saw a few references to The Boys, is that the Eddy thats in that content group? im not very sure so maybe someone will know.
“Criticism” Ah yes, that thing where all you do is deconstruct and tear people down without any constructive feedback.
I love how keems only response is transphobia
Keem is in his bed alone with a hoodie and a beanie lol
The fact that he tried to act like it was all fun and a troll to him is hilarious
This went from a gnome going after luigi, to a &quot;conversation&quot; about being called different pronouns.
keemstar left a banana peel on the floor and then went home and congratulated himself for the rest of the day.

Eddy Burbag does make garbage content tho
Hes actually kinda funny right now but hes still killed etika.
Why aint there any videos of keem getting confronted he goes to like every public event, i wanna see how fast he stops talking
The family stuff he had to do is to hit another dog in 70mph with his daughter and his truck.
I literally laughed until I died when keem tried to roast someone because they  wear a mask
Keem out here reading someone pronouns on video, like ok? Thanks for telling us there pronouns. <br><br>Like wtf? Is keem really expecting us to get triggered or that person to get triggered over for keem  reading out that persons bio??? <br><br><br>Whoever responds like that to a Twitter argument, NEVER HAVE KIDS. <br><br>It’s like sayin someone’s age during a Irl argument, it’s so dumb <br><br>I really hope his daughter gets taken away because his daughter does not deserve him to be a father.
I have no idea how keem thought Eddy had any connection to reddit?
I hate keemstar
Seems like Keem<br><b>REALLY had nothing going, huh? LMAO</b><br>Damn dude.
the worst part is that he sleeps fully clothed with sweatshirt, hat, and all
Keem telling people they can&#39;t take criticism is hilariously ironic. Here&#39;s a man who will only admit he&#39;s wrong when he risks facing defamation charges. Telling someone they aren&#39;t funny isn&#39;t criticism, it&#39;s an opinion. What a grinch.
keem isnt wrong though eddy is not funny at all
It offends me that this thing has a fanbase.
Half of keemstars career can be ruined by removing the copy and paste button
keemstar: I need drama<br>everyone: there is none<br>keemstar: fine, I&#39;ll do it myself
Can’t believe this all happened in my birthday and I missed it
Aka Keemstar explains why proper pronouns are important followed by Keemstar not understanding proper use of pronouns
Keemstar is the quintessential example for still doing the whole &quot;what&#39;s up with these SJWs??&quot; spiel in 2021. If you&#39;re still doing that in 2021, you&#39;re not just an idiot, you&#39;re Keemstar. Do you want to be Keemstar?
Can we like.. evict Keemstar or something? Everything he does online is dead weight at best
Boys support Boys
E
In general I hate the whole “canceling” movement but if it happened to Keem, I’d give it my FULL support.
I love the whole Gus/Eddy group and ex Lunchclub all shitting on him
“Learn how to take criticism” rich coming from the guy that already has 4 essay tweet responses prepared when someone doesn’t worship him
Didn&#39;t Keemstar bully a little kid by breaking his game and then shoving an ice cream in his face?
This man is the grinch
It was Christmas Eve eve
Keem is such a fuckin egoist
Keemstars funny asf
it&#39;s stuff like this, after you find yourself rooting for keem when H3H3 has gone to shit and is doing really stupid stuff, that you realize that it&#39;s still KEEMSTAR we&#39;re talking about here.
I enjoy me some roasted Keem.
I like Keem <br>I genuinely appreciate that people like him exist
Keem is garbage
Kids in the next generation are SO lucky<br>They don&#39;t have to deal with dipshit in the future.<br>If I can&#39;t see him leave any platform then I am just happy that my future children&#39;s children don&#39;t live in a world without him lol

I couldn’t disagree with Keem more about losing perspective because you dropped your character for a while. <br><br>When you’ve opened up to us about your struggles with depression and anxiety, I don’t think someone like Keem could understand that being relatable and showing empathy can help your audience, who may be going through similar struggles. <br><br>It’s a lot easier to forgive someone when they occasionally drop the charade and act like a real human being to the public.
Thanks
I thought his channel died..
I will never understand why keemstar acts like he’s still in his teens 😭💀 bro is old asf prolly dyes his beard

Keemstar on mve
Okay , so I watched this through because I enjoy your work Boogie, and I want to see you continue to succeed.<br><br>I was curious whether Keemstar would say anything to shake my view of him. He didn&#39;t. For me, drama YouTube has always been dull and it came across as very staged. I&#39;d happily watch a more positive YouTuber on loop than drama shows any day of the week.<br><br>Putting aside the bad stuff that has been said about Keemstar, and looking at this based purely on what he&#39;s said himself here, I just don&#39;t get the appeal. He&#39;s arrogant, and it felt like he&#39;s deflecting criticism for the most part.<br><br>Keemstar is also not the bad guy he&#39;s trying to be. The best bad guys have substance. He has a hokey delivery style and a desire to stir stuff up. I can&#39;t hate him because he doesn&#39;t grab me in a way that makes me care enough. It has been years since I watched one of his videos, and it&#39;ll be a long time before I try again, if I do at all. He&#39;s honestly just not worth dedicating time to.<br><br>And to answer the question asked : I have no issue finding things to watch on YouTube and it has recommended plenty of fun stuff to me. So, no. I&#39;m not bored.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXdd_aOu7Q&amp;t=31m28s"">31:28</a> However that was not how Mr. Beast rose to fame. And like him there are hundreds more out there.
Never heard of someone telling therr parents that they wanna be a clown when they grow up
Wonder if keem was pulling those same strings he boast with etika or anyone els hes gone after for nothing
4,000.00 is a ton of money to me 😭
Fun stuff
Idk anything about keemstar (or boogie, really) but hes right about the cancel culture thing. People who want to &#39;cancel&#39; ppl want them to squirm and deny or apologize. They never attack ppl who are openly racist, for example. Bc he wont deny it and, as vile as it is, THEYRE proud of it. They own it. They want someone who will apologize so that to them its a small victory.

never followed keemstar
How right keemstare is now a days going on YouTube there is nothing to wach now a days so now all I do it get so bored
who knew that keemstar caused drama? what a shocking revaluation
Since RichTechUSASS is taking a break, we&#39;re gonna need you to be the new Rich, and do a bunch of weird Bird/Horse stuff.
Your as nostalgic as newgrounds &#39;imma just say that dere.
Dang dude your face looks like it got messed up
4 million sub channel and you cant get the audio right?
Bashurverse almost is the same like keemstar and his &quot;Employee&quot;.........😂😂😂
Best Interview yet
Keemstar is the biggest poosie and cannot be identified as a MAN 😅😂
thank you for puttting this out , been trying to explain to my soon to be 14 year that  its not just putting a vid out , he want to be an youtuber when he is older
Personally I don’t have any problem finding stuff to watch on YouTube but then again what I watch is no where in the wheel house of the type of stuff Keem puts out.<br><br>That being said he is correct in that YouTube tried to push stuff at you often times getting in the way of what I actually want to watch. It’s why I often find myself just manually going into my favorites and manually choosing what to watch.
I would say I&#39;m not bored with content... then again, I&#39;m subscribed to over 300 channels (inc. non active) - I just keep well away from the recommended / curated content, manually select the channels with updates... and screw the  &#39;shorts&#39;.
What’s up, Boogie2988 of the internet. I’ve been a fan forever and I never gave up on you. So glad to see you doing well. You got me into Hearthstone long ago with WowHobbs. I’ll always be a fan of you Boogie. ❤️
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXdd_aOu7Q&amp;t=28m04s"">28:04</a> I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say we&#39;re living in a simulation (my personal belief;) but rather because of my spirituality a playground to the gods. I believe theres a higher power judging our every move; to see if we&#39;re capable of progressing into a more powerful and ethereal dimension / new reality. This Earth is only one of many many many planets. And if you think we&#39;re the only ones breathing; being watched; thats within your right of expression and beliefs. However it doesn&#39;t seem logical. Consider the &quot;for every action; theres a reaction&quot; theory as well. For every bit of dark; there&#39;s light. Thats what keeps me going.
I wish I could hug you for 34 seconds to take it all out crying of suffering. I know that feeling when people treat you like it is, but people don’t know they hurt your feelings. It sucks to live like that, pretending you are not socially anxious. After mathematics, social anxiety is a f-ing mental abuse. I played pool with a good stranger, I won and I enjoyed that “Very well” and “high five”. Something I don’t receive too much from people, even my family when I win in any game” As an autistic person, I wish I could show who I really am when I’m not anxious. If I could show so much! AAGGH!! I would love it!
Why tf did yourube tell me that this trash interview between two garbage humans was new?
I think you left your microwave open 😂
This is just one of the reasons why boogie is YT Royalty, one of the daddies!

Keem is the big good guy
I don’t care for this person. But I made sure to watch a small part of the video and give it a thumbs up. I did so because I really like this series and want it to continue. Thanks for the content and keep it up.
Keemstar casually saying that he is the bad guy and does it just to benefit him lmao. This man’s whole mindset is absolute fucked because it was literally tormenting peoples lives
Great work boog
ohhh, good ole schemestar
The fact that keem exploited you and made fun of and you think he is being nice u are delusional
Boogie— I think you’ve found your voice. Keep doing these long form interviews. You’re actually a natural at it. You just need to invest in some mic’s. The audio wasn’t the best here.  Despite that this is great content.
This guy seems incapable of sharing an opinion without swearing every couple words. I do understand it here and there but he literally does it in nearly every sentence! He also doesn’t seem to have an ounce of humility. I think this word is overused but…he sounds like a narcissist. This is actually my first exposure to the guy. This isn’t what I expected. I’ve only heard his name mentioned a bunch of times in relation to internet culture. So I’ve never watched his content. But I have to say I’m not impressed. 🤷‍♂️
Whenever someone tells me that they think this is all a simulation I think it’s important to immediately punch them in the face. This is not a simulation — God  gives us free will to choose.",PT1H15S,0.9995

Hey keemstar didn&#39;t u made some commit Sucide
I don’t like Keemstar, don’t get me wrong I don’t like it. I got one question how does leaving the platform make him take responsibility. He already took responsibility for his actions. He apologized, he I guess was taking therapy and did other stuff. Don’t get me wrong I don’t support mini either but how dumb do you got to be to not know the definition of responsibility, I mean I didn’t know keem was that brain dead. All these YouTubers man have zero knowledge and it makes sense why they do YouTube cause their too dumb to do anything else
I just wish miniladd would have taken his advice and left he&#39;s just spitting straight facts
Yeah , but his dislikes are becoming &quot;normal&quot; and not deserved (10 times more dislikes than likes at minimum) , he is coming back ... sadly.
I like keems sweatshirt.
Keemstar i was never interested in u and i only seen one of your videos about 2 weeks ago...  but sheeeeeeeeeeeeeesh THIS VIDEO IS SICK FUCK MINI LAD
I just don&#39;t get it. People asked him to say sorry. Take responsibility. Then he gets backlash for doing it. Like what do you all want. Yea Craig sould be punished for what happened but like your kicking a dead horse here, by ripping into him after something everyone has been asking for. I&#39;m just confused about it all. Doesn&#39;t make since
I think keem is a bitch but he is speaking facts
Keem needs to call out Mini Ladd again
But no…he’s back making new fucking videos again acting like nothing happened<br><br><br>Oh and even better recently he was playing Pokémon Legends Arceus…A KIDS GAME!!!!
the dislikes are from the mini ladd fans
lock MiniLadd up
Even tho Keem is an asshole, I agree with him on this one.
I find keem really fucking toxic but damn and I understand why he says this but he was taking responsibility and if I were to take responsibility for say assault I wouldn’t need to leave I could pay for some therapy and medical bills if it was bad and stuff like that
Ay yall ignoring what Keem is talking about why do people not like Keem I thought people like him or some shit
Mine lad still talking about drama every time
I like what  hey thinks
Facts...but what did kiwiz do?!
As much of an asshole keemstar is I 100% agree with him on mini ladd
Okay but when is keem going to take some responsibility for some of the shit he’s pulled
I never really liked keem... but<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>He’s a tool and minilad is a tool. Neither of them get my respect and I ain’t choosing sides
keem sucks ngl
Speaking pure facts I respect that.  Pedophiles don’t belong on YouTube or children’s video  games where they can have access to more children.
How old was she
Sometimes we all make mistakes and sometimes we all get ourselves a forgiving, but even if all you people who later on became haters from Mini just because he did something extremely stupid. Every single one of you just doesn’t give him a 2nd chance of forgiveness in him anymore and even 2 weeks ago there has been a say of a video he will comeback again in his channel, but videos upon videos of people talking sh*ts talks about him not learning his lesson about leaving and don’t comeback.<br><br>So look guys we all make mistakes and mini did the same, but I forgive him and give a 3rd chance just as for this only 1 time that if he comes back and play video games (just play games will you) and if he made the same mistakes again before (just make him leave because he lost his 3rd chance).
True facts
“Then leave”<br>He did...?
Keem should quit cause he should stay out of it aswell as you all
Every guy in this section: I hate keemštár but this i like
Love or hate keem, he can be childish and irresponsible, but he’s not the villain.
Maybe it will sound weird but i cant listen keemstar after his mistakes he did in past. Its just weird listening somebody who says about someone that he is bad and should leave when that same person did mistakes which for that he should leave too. Hate me ahead if i said smth wrong
I&#39;m not a fan of Keemstar at all, but this was 100% on the mark.
I don&#39;t like Keem but for some reason seeing him rip into mini ladd is so sweet. Idk it&#39;s like an anime villain becoming the temporary hero😂😂
Legit I cannot stand keemstar at all and he is a shitty person.... but ya even I gotta say keemstar did a good thing with calling our Craig and all
This makes me respect Keemstar
I’ll always hate Keem...<br><br><br><br><br>But what he said here is facts. Respect ✊
I’m almost 100% sure he won’t come back now
I used to like keem but what he did with this mini Ladd story is unforgivable. You twisted this story, spread false information, and gaslighted for views. You&#39;re worse than mini is by fucking far for that.
This is what I posted on mini lads video. People deserve chances and forgiveness. As long as you get help.<br><br>Bud I’m not someone who holds grudges. What you did is not ok. But if you get help and work to fix your problem. Then I can respect you trying. You need to fight for your respect again. At least for me you have at least taken a step in the right direction by admitting to the things you have done. Get help and come back stronger and better. Be a better person Craig.
Keem is a douche but at least he ain&#39;t thirsty on kids
Keem yoinked his minecraft privileges
Love how every comment is talking about how they hate keem but agree with him lmao nice job y’all
Just accept the apology
Keem spitting fax
I don&#39;t know you nor Miniladd.. been out of the Youtube scene for a long time. Looking at what popping up lately I can&#39;t help put my ear to this stuff. What I gathered from watching his victims response and his response. MiniLadd is plain and simple a NARCISSIST!!! Trying to take attention off of him trying to deflect the his actions. These minors had young minds when their minds matured more they had a better understanding of it was just smoke and mirrors. Miniladd had already a mature mind knowing what he was doing by society standers was wrong. He didn&#39;t care about what society thinks. He doesn&#39;t care about the youtube society either all he cares about is his self image and it will crush him if he can&#39;t manipulate more around to side with him. The proof is in the pudding. He confessed what he did admitting he is guilty. He isn&#39;t sorry he&#39;s sorry for the fact that he is being exposed. And those whom support him are just as guilty. This man doesn&#39;t deserve human interaction. Maybe that&#39;s why he hides behind his screen locked in his room?
Leaving is not always the only option, You people dont get it, he proofed that he apologized, and he told us why he continued to upload. Move the Fuck on people
Keemstar is a fucking lad for this
I have never liked or trusted you keemstar... not until today. This isn’t about drama. This is about right and wrong. Mini is a monster. You did the right thing by calling his bluff...... Thank you keemstar.....

Even I don&#39;t and I&#39;m not poor, but I&#39;m not gonna spend 10 times the price of Coca Cola in a store just to get maybe a slightly better feeling. It&#39;s really not 10 times as good as sitting at home. Food is more worth it because they have to cook it and do the dishes. Handing you a can of Coke with a 10x markup doesn&#39;t take any effort. Then they have the nerve to ask for a tip to walk 20 feet with less than 400 grams to carry.
Name a better couple than Keem the garden gnome and self-owns
Companies said &quot;If you don&#39;t like it leave&quot; We did... Now it&#39;s &quot;Why are they not coming to work for us?&quot; &lt;-- for the same reason we left.
literally, there isn&#39;t even really a labor shortage. I know so many people who have applied to work at places that have had &quot;help wanted&quot; signs up for literally months and they can&#39;t even get an interview, regardless of the fact that they&#39;re qualified. The simple fact is that it&#39;s more profitable to run with a skeleton crew and just work them ragged, but that&#39;s not exactly a winning message in the current environment, so they pretend to be trying to find workers and then never hire anyone, so that they can then turn around and tell the media that they&#39;ve been &quot;hiring&quot; for months, and that the reason they haven&#39;t filled out their staff <b>must</b> be that no one wants to work.<br><br>People <b>do</b> want to work. Employers are just lying.
It’s such a simple fix for companies to get back to full staffing, the majority of people would love to go back to work but can’t justify those shit hourly wages on an extremely unrewarding job. There is a portion of the population who take advantage of the system and chose not to work but those people were doing that before the “employee shortage” but there’s a reason why it’s exponential worse now than before the pandemic, if companies want to succeed then just take a note out of Ford’s early business model of paying people a competitive wage and allow your employees time to recoup and be ready for the work week, all of the things which helped Ford become a company in which thrived through its early years and continues to hold strong today. Paying living wages benefits all parties involved only if companies could get out of the small minded thought of quick profits

Hopefully the worker shortage will change Business owners minds on how they treat the labor force
Not sure if Quimster or Cuntster is more appropriate for that p.o.s.
everytime hasan gives his opinion on anything other than politics. i tune him out. he&#39;s so god dammn annoying an actual kill joy. I wouldn&#39;t invite him anywhere because he&#39;ll just make everyone have shitter time. <br><br>anyways i think he&#39;s good political pundit but awful variety streamer 👍
why don&#39;t meekstar work in those places then?
imagine the skin under keems beard 🤢
He&#39;s a &quot;beardfish.&quot;
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE MONEY!<br><br>I don’t care how much a job pays if they aren’t willing to work with my schedule, if they aren’t willing to give me 40 hours consistently, if they aren’t going to give me a good working environment, etc. The money is a huge part of it, but the other 50 percent is literally EVERYTHING ELSE.
the people mad about fast food restaurants being understaffed are rich people, because people with less understand that those in the FF industry probably left to find something that could ACTUALLY support them. 8 bucks an hour doesn&#39;t cut it no matter how you look at it.
He listed some of the most entry level underpaid and under appreciated jobs... he&#39;s not really complaining about people not achieving livelihood he&#39;s complaining there&#39;s not enough wage slaves trapped serving him a hotdogs at 4 a.m. Keemstar shut up
If Keemstar didn&#39;t use the fact no one was working a poorly paid job at 2am so he couldn&#39;t get food after as an example, he might have done better at arguing his point.
Can&#39;t afford rent without a job, can&#39;t afford rent with a job. What exactly is the incentive? For most people it makes more sense to hold out for something better, and &quot;better&quot; is very hard to come by in this economy because everything is temporary, seasonal, contract, internship that doesn&#39;t lead to a full-time position, etc.
In every other country people only need one job to stay &quot;afloat&quot; but the US don&#39;t believe in living wages, 3jobs minimum!
Who the fuck eats a hotdog and a hamburger as a meal. 🤮
Hasan baby talking keemstar is legit how I speak to my dog and my parrot
I was considered essential during the entire lockdown. They cut my hours by making me work alternating days to limit exposure. Luckily they paid me to stay home but without any differentials or hazard pay. I had friends and relatives let go from dead end jobs who recieved almost twice my income for at least half a year. <br><br>While the stimulus and the additional federal unemployment benefits helped many people out and i do support it even now. The flaw is that <b>*many*</b> but not all essential personal ended up getting used with complete disregard.
Must be nice I have a job, and I donate plasma 2 times a week for an extra 100$. And I still barely make it. Rent, bills, I have a child who has expenses. This dude is an absolute clown. It&#39;s not that people don&#39;t work it that there are not enough jobs that actually let you support yourself.
Imagine working 1 whole hour for  only 8 bucks. Bro I get it there’s a shortage but when rent bills need to be paid $8/hour isn’t gonna cut it
I work in a restaurant in an area that&#39;s experiencing a &quot;labor shortage&quot;. Because people are paid well, given employee housing, and work well together, we haven&#39;t been experiencing the difficulties of not having enough people to work the same way other restaurants are. The shitty employers are the ones having serious problems
Go on Twitter to ask for help...so that&#39;s what they do? And who are they...some fictitious made up person?
Keemstar really films his videos like he&#39;s filming one of those old musical.y (or however tf you spell it) videos
Keem is so smoothbrained.
The reason in my town no one is there to work at the fast food or other places like that is because people died, left, or are retired. I graduated 2021 all my classmates left for college and cheaper housing. The average cost for a rental is 2000$ a month how are kids right out of high school with their minimum wage McDonalds job supposed to live. They aren&#39;t. On top of people leaving in masse. We had a huge number of workers die due to the pandemic (red county in my state lots of trump supporters and wackos)
ModCheck hasan reacts to my collob with j Aubry
My buddy is a Jiffy Lube manager and he’s always stressing about not having enough people due to how low they pay their techs<br><br>They start them at like 10 dollars an hour and it’s not easy work when they have to do 80-100 cars a day so i a lot of kids say “I can be doing a lot less for the same money” and they quit <br><br>My boy is always cancelling day off plans because he has no people or has to cover for someone cause there’s no one else that can cover… people cannot live on less than 15 dollars an hour and even at 15/hr you still struggle.<br><br><br>There is money… it’s just that the people up top want to hog all of it
I like how we&#39;re in a situation where we spent the last 40 years treating people in low level service jobs like actual trash, imply that no one except for people under 18 should seriously be working these jobs and if you are you fucked up in life, wages have remained stagnant, conditions have gotten worse, prices have gone up, and then the economy crashes twice spectacularly in the span of 20 years- all this happens, and then we turn around and wonder &quot;why does no one want to work at [insert retail/food place here]?&quot;<br><br>Maybe because people are literally at the limit where they can&#39;t, they can&#39;t work a shit job for shit pay under the worst possible conditions only to not be able to pay rent, utilities, insurance, transportation, and buy food.  I live in Ohio, and now you&#39;re saying basically every single place bump up wages if not to $15/hr, then pretty close, and that&#39;s across the board even though minimum wage is like $8 or $9 here.  Isn&#39;t it interesting that federal $15/hr minimum wage didn&#39;t pass, but it basically just happened anyway by de facto because people literally cannot survive on a lower wage than that 99% of the time.
Keem should work at Burger King if he feels that strongly about chicken tendies
His voice is so grating and annoying. I want to claw my ears out whenever I hear Keemstar’s voice.
Why is Leemstar avoiding eye contact its weird
i work for 7-11 profits went up 4% duriing first year of covid they cut the pay from 15 to 12 an hour noooww we cant get people to take the job cuz the pay sucks
&quot;Why do I keep getting hate?&quot;
People who complain about the “worker shortage” need to go do those jobs themselves. I’m fucking sick of listening to it. It’s pathetic.<br><br>How about instead of telling people to “get a job” make your own damn tendies and burgies, America.
Too bad there were no teenagers available to work the low wage 3am hotdog job
There&#39;s something magical about a guy who sits at home begging for money on the internet all day complaining about how everyone just wants to sit at home and beg for money on the internet.
&quot;You should get a damn job!&quot;<br><br>Says the guy who hasn&#39;t worked a real job in his life.
The jobs have to be appealing for people to want to work there period. This pandemic has made people sit down and actually think about where they want to put their time, you really can&#39;t expect people to just accept whatever conditions any old rinky dink job provides when everyone is looking for workers. It was different when most of the jobs were accounted for and no one didn&#39;t have this much choices to pick from. To those jobs I would say do better or everyone will go someplace else better than your employment. Just like how we have to compete with other workers for jobs they have to compete with other businesses for the workers",PT4M5S,-0.9512

H3h3 is a hater I don’t get why people watch him. How low do you gotta be to talk crap about normal human interactions idk maybe it’s just me but he just gives me bad vibes
Omg I literally laughed so hard
This sht is cringe
NO WAY IS $3 TARGET GARABAGE REAL ? SHOW THE INGREDIENTS. THE BEEF JERKY ISN&#39;T EVEN THE SAME? THEY WHERE EATING VENECIN, DEER MEAT. THE BESTMEAT AROUND.
The way chew makes me squirm 😂
What’s wrong with the guy’s wrist? He’s always shaking it.
Maple syrup on meat is a Native American delicacy! Smokes fished lathered in maple syrup is absolutely amazing.
Ethan has fell off… keem really took the w in the end.
Seems like some real petty shit. Watch a video from a guy (that you hate) and pick the smallest things to make fun of. Plus doing it with a room of yes man is ultra cringe
most petty people ever ur like a ten yr old
How many times are you going to repeat it taste like beef jerky when the people your hire fake laugh every time it hurts them lmaoo
Most awkward video I’ve watched in a while the jokes were horrible you just made yourself look like a joke here Ethan.
This had no right being this funny
Maple bacon jerky is fire tho. He’s almost got it.
Bruh I know that kitchen smells like shiiii
I love sweet and hot jerky
Bro is obsessed with keem
rent free
Not one to suck keem off but upstate New York maple syrup is godlike. We used to have a neighbor who made his own and it was unlike anything I’ve had in the store
Keep saying “Taste like beef jerky”, gets funnier ever time -<i>_</i>-
I really don&#39;t like Keem or Fousey but I don&#39;t get waht the deal is? Just seems like two bros enjoying a snack — I&#39;ve definitely been to a certain deli and raved about how good generic ass ham is compared to other places.

This is just petty ethen

No one likes you Ethan
omg, haven’t seen ethan in a while, he looks… different
Isn’t Fousy braking Haram⁉️
I’m originally from Buffalo and my friend is cousins w Keemstar. She said her family stopped talking to him a long time ago lol
Being Texas Native, and how obnoxiously proud we are of our home, I kinda feel for Keem. Still can’t stand him, but I’m slowly starting to feel sorry for him. Especially since he already can’t stand rejection and now he’s being teased on something he was proud to show.
Yeah Fousey, close your mouth, when you chew. My middle name is Yusuf, just like your first name, is!
Even more cringey watching Fousey&#39;s video the second time!
why the FUCK does he chew like that I wanted to die
I will give a secret mix maple and butter and cinnamon put oven on 200 and for 3 hours every 30 minutes flip in oven and you will make candied jersey so good kemstars local butcher would shit himself!
Hate Keem but until people start eating waffles and pancakes with a spoon why dirty another utensil to eat syrup?
I laughed at the part when they ate beef jerky and said it tastes like beef jerky
This is mad corny bro lol you’re so lame for this🤣🤣
ethan has the chew zone, but Fousey on a whole other level with that smacking, had to mute it, shook me to my core
insult him by eating nice one buddy
tate is your daddy
don’t care old bum
Ethan literally has Rick&amp;Morty teeth
Fusy chewing like a horse with those big ass horse teeth is just too much for me everytime.
“My childhood cow” 😂😂😂 and the fact that no one caught it made me so sad 😭

To be honest, Pokimane is a terrible content creator. Most of her content is just eating a salad and not saying anything, while reacting to a video not made by her. It’s also weird that she try’s to block this video for copyright infringement, even though you don’t get payed for tweeting.
Keemstar is the person who isn’t a bitch like everyone in the rest of the world
why is he getting hate for saying the truth abt sssniperwolf ghosting the fan..
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9qhlsHrA50&amp;t=9m12s"">9:12</a> Yeah that’s a little TOO weird
Hehe. It&#39;s funny how pokimani defending &#39;V&#39;s and her friend sssniperbich calling other &#39;V&#39;. It&#39;s like you defending your people but your friend come out of nowhere and use N word.
Mad respect to keem star

Pokimane fedmyster that’s all I have to say

i despise keem star always making bs for no reason like the recent Sssniperwolf thing But poki takes the L
team keemstar all the way
Pokemain rlly trying to be dear man lol
fuck keemstar is funny
The mad lad keemstar
Poki took the L here
Poki says keem is resorting to cheap likes. Poki HOW DO YOU GET MONEY.
KEEM reason he hasent been put down yet is because he doesn’t care about hate. Cancel Culture is supposed to “hurt your feelings” into stop doing YouTube because no matter how many people leave him there will still always be fans left. This strategy although doesn’t work on a man of steel
So like who actually takes keemstars side?
Keemstar definitely won that
Pokimane took a big L at the start itself
Among us sus
The black guy in the middle lmao BEST PART
man that fan at the start was probably a virgin tbh
Pokimane has made me cringe harder than I have ever cringed before.
Keem is correct..... if a fan gets so upset that he commits suicide bcoz some creator whom he doesn&#39;t like r gives a shit about calls him a virgin...., just imagine all the online creators getting bullied ..do they commit suicide?? u can&#39;t be that weak...
My Alexa went off.
i agree with Poki in this situation.
&quot;Innocent fans&quot;
as far as beef goes, this was pretty pointless. tho hilarious to unravel.
Poki always has been trash

You keep a man that long in your head boi you better look yourself in the mirror and figure out if your actually a man.
I love keemstar
It’s weird to hear the girl sitting next to Ethan saying that children pick up on everything their children do and say, and then thinking about what kind of parents Keemstar had as a kid, that’s even more disturbing honestly
I just  remembered Ethan saying the word &quot;soy boy&quot;..lmao what is that?😂😅

Well horses are beautiful and intelligent creatures, so you should try to take it as a compliment, even if it&#39;s said to hurt you, just say thanks to him, it&#39;ll make him angry, and he&#39;ll keep coming at you and it&#39;ll be funny seeing how pathetic he is, it&#39;s not like he doesn&#39;t have a life, he has a <b>daughter</b> which makes it even sadder, he should stop focusing on the Internet and focus on his family, like bruh- <b>stop.</b>

Ew this is the cringiest shit I’ve ever seen
you seem so jelly lol
I was a fan of Keemstar back in 2015 when I didn’t know any better. I was a teenager. I woefully regret supporting such a colossal piece of shit because his content seemed funny. I did not see how his videos or actions could affect others. If I had to guess, that’s where it’s at for most of his audience now. They’re young, they don’t understand nor give a shit. That might change in a few years or not. It’s the same thing with any other creator.<br><br>In the state of YouTube today, you can be a racist, dox someone out of spite, accuse an innocent man of pedophilia, take zero responsibility when your audience attacks him, reflect blame towards people when they ask for accountability, use cancel culture to dismiss valid criticism, make fun of mentally ill folks on occasion, flirt with an underage child, make inappropriate comments towards a guy and his kids, and still get away with it. Anyone else would have their channel terminated, or be harassed and cancelled out of a career. But for some ungodly reason, none of that has come to fruition. What people want is accountability, not cancel culture. There is neither here.
That really, really hurt to watch. Can guys get the douche chills?

its relative, Keemstar doesn&#39;t seem so bad after what I heard tonight
he’s the epitome of “..and then what? ;)”
That girl seems young but not dumb. I don&#39;t understand why she&#39;d like him? You&#39;ve got your life ahead of you kid, run with it!
Mmmm
Fucking love these videos 😂😂
Ethan I love you and always have since 2013, but this was actually torture! I’d rather eat live worms then watch this Keem shit. It was so cringe, and indescribable! 🤢
Keemstar isn’t the lion king.  He’s the lyin’ king.
He can&#39;t even stop himself from doing his cringy shriek-laugh even when trying to flirt.
Keemstar flirting with girls barely half his age is not something that needed to be shown (or happen even) in my lifetime.
How do you unsee/unhear something
&quot;Please make it stop... yet we continue forth.&quot;
Keemstar had done alot of shady things over the years hes not even supposed to be on youtube best been terminated and blacklisted before
I’m not a Keem fan but I don’t think this is as bad as what Ethan is making it. A bit cringey, but as long as she’s over 18, who cares? Should Keem be going after women his own age? Sure, but as long as she’s over she seems like she’s into him
I’m going to barf
This hurt my eyes and ears😭
Keemstar is making such a weird cheeky face during all of that
This should have a trigger warning
I can’t believe I am watching this it is hurting me
lol she looks like 51 not 15

please trust Ethan when he says this video is dangerous. i honestly don&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna be able to recover from the amount of cringe this video contains.

keem built like a stack of oreos
I’m watching this episode and I must tell you the only cringe I see and feel if you. You’re trying to make a conversation between two people disgusting. It’s not like he’s asking her to be his girlfriend, really.
she looks about 25
this is the most cringe video i’ve ever seen omfg
Oh my God Ethan you are such an ass for this! Talk about morbid curiosity… I completely regret it now, lol! That&#39;s what I get for being nosy! This was so damn painful! I think it&#39;s so funny that gamestop can talk so much crap ripping people to shreds or creating false narratives or blaming victims for 45 minutes straight without taking a breath and not stuttering just once, however, talks to a little girl that hes interested in and can&#39;t seem to say more than 2 or 3 words at a time and then struggle like a 5th grader trying to ask a little girl out to the Valentine&#39;s Day dance! Jesus Christ this almost reminds me of the conversations between  Moses and the other girls he was talking to before he got with Trisha. This is so  Horrible and pathetic!
Watching Ethan in real time try to find the name of ‘Scar’ on google and coming out with ‘Simba’ actually finished me off
You know your down bad if you have to name drop Trisha Paytas
Its a warcrime to show this video Ethan. I hate you now. This was too cringe.
She is just as cringe...yikes
Douche chills describes this perfectly, as a guy I can honestly say while yes I’ve flirted and softened up a bit I never went full “sexy voice” and all, it’s not even close to my personality it would sound so bad and fake like keem does here, it’s so unnatural but he actually thinks it’s sexy lol
I used gnome boys name in a comment and my comment literally disappeared... hmm

I genuinely wish this man did not exist.
The yellow eye shadow look is really iconic btw!!! I wanna do it now
Keem is unsavoury for sure
Me prior to video: Finally I get to find out what this dude’s deal is.<br><br>Me after video: ah. Weaponized gossip columnist. Got it.
Hi, just fyi, I think you might be using the word &quot;denounce&quot; incorrectly.
im constantly watching your videos, i appreciate the effort you put into them, youre gonna make a big impact in this life, im manifesting it for you! thank you for your content, its awesome and you n squishgang rock.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNutexfvxdM&amp;t=3m48s"">3:48</a> I was trying to explain this concept to a lot of people in my life, but I couldn’t say it in words that were making sense for them! I feel low key validated 🤡
Thumbs up! Promote your social media with *PromoSM*!!
I loved how you said &quot;trolling nature&quot; lollll. fab vid.
I’m slowly working my way through all of your videos and I love them! I had heard of Keemstar but knew nothing about him. I spent the whole video asking myself “who IS this clown??” 😂
Bitches be so late to drama tryna explain the behavior of a retarded man child with facts and logic😭the keemstar exposed trend been milked dry for years now bro is not even posting any more lmao. Why was this necessary? Think about how you are spending large amounts of your time. Any mf who has spent enough time on YouTube to find your channel knows who keem is and what he’s done. No offense
I hate that the pasty incel-lite commentary bros have somehow declared themselves arbiters of Logic™️ when most of what they spew is just hateful alt-right rhetoric.
Tea because the makeup look here is iconic, essential, groundbreaking, but something just as incredible is you’re BRAINS. So f’n smart. Literally love your videos 👏🏼
Look. I&#39;m not going to be surprised if Keemstar is absive himself.<br>There is a point where it stops being contrarian and starts to become… worrisome.
My opinion towards Keemstar has always been and will always be:<br>I would suplex him for free
Your make up is so cute 🤗10/10
gonna be kind to myself in bad mental health moments just to spite keemstar
Your makeup is so cute!!!❤️
Your face makeup looks so glowy and smooth what products do you use??😍😍 also I love watching your videos you always have the best takes:)
i would never flat out say i support keemstar, but i can’t say that the chaos he starts everywhere he goes isnt very entertaining. <br><br>saying that, im a new subscriber and i just wanted to say i absolutely love your content, good job :)
I love this video and I hate that creature
Keem <i>is</i> like a roach. He gets in the middle of everything, everywhere. A few months ago, I was watching a smaller channel livestreaming (~100 viewers) about something that changed to whichever drama topic du jour. They had the person on a Discord call insisting they &quot;weren&#39;t trying to get attention&quot; and had &quot;proof&quot; of such, but it was part of a group convo that had parts they didn&#39;t want public (idk - could have been personal info, trash talk, w/e). They could have just redacted those parts, so idk. But point is: Keem was there, apparently. Showed up in the chat - and it was him - being like, &quot;Call me! Lemme call! What&#39;s the Discord?&quot; They accepted, and shared that screenshot with him under the condition that he&#39;d &quot;keep it private&quot;. He agreed, saw it, and insisted that, &quot;No, yeah, didn&#39;t do it. Ain&#39;t lying.&quot; I don&#39;t know how they trusted him, nor how it worked out after that, but what a sad, low point for Keem.
I got recommended this after watching the newest H3.  I&#39;ve seen so much DJ Killer &quot;Daniel&quot; Keemstar content that I know where this is going.....
Its nice to see someone who hasnt been exposed to keemstar for the last 15 years have a fresh opionion on this toxic human
does anyone else get feel like there is a lot of overlap between j* and keemstar and it is not just their names? (also mika your eyeshadow look is gorgeous)
I&#39;m glad someone&#39;s covering him again, he&#39;s a psycho
Mika, as someone who used to watch Keemstar, I felt that this video was very fair and factual.  Appreciate your unique perspective as always.
Did you find this all IN A BOOK HAH?
watching your content evolve over the past year has been so amazing, every time you post you and your content grow so much and I hope you know your effort is not going unnoticed 🫶 seeing you on my feed is always a joy
I didnt know he was the one that revealed pyros face. That’s terrible
The way you said that he&#39;s been here for so long and how I feel like I&#39;ve seen like 70% of his career on the internet just-<br>It makes me feel old and I&#39;m like 26 wtf
you did an amazing job on this video, super well edited and professional!
Keemstar being a former wedding DJ literally had me howling at the gym 😭great video as always Mika🫡
Excited for the extra December vids ❤good luck for end of semester!
Are you a H3 Auntie....you must be an Auntie
omg he’s so stupid, the way you respond to what he’s said about you  was the best thing in the whole world i could listen to like a 5 hour video of you destroying keemstar again, he’s just so hateful and embarrassing
ANOTHA ONE!!!!!! best youtube creator ever!!!!!!!!!!! you always make the best videos! thank you!!!!
i genuinely love your videos, i fully agree on everything you said about Keemstar but apart from that please keep going making the videos you do the way they are currently. I love the structuring and little sections where you bring in your degree. Also, please don’t worry about the length of the videos.
It’s just the sheer amount of entitlement this man has, acting like he is above everyone and that if he is nice to someone at all, they owe him for the rest of their life.
I&#39;ve not finished the video yet but thus far the most shocking thing to me is that Keem talked to Ethan on a podcast!! (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNutexfvxdM&amp;t=14m40s"">14:40</a>) I thought they never spoke to each other, only had beef! 🤯
keemstar is genuinely human scum. i don’t understand why people want to be friends with him.
Mika - it would be amazing if you watched Dad Challenge Podcast on Colleen Ballinger. Not so much for his commentary (even though I agree) but Colleen&#39;s rhetoric regarding Youtube taking monetization on children&#39;s videos with p&#39;s comments. <br><br>The way she structured her arguments were....interesting and I saw a lot of things I recognize but lack the knowledge in theory, etc. to know what they are....I think she&#39;s important to look at since so many of her viewers are young. The way arguments are constructed can def change and shape someone&#39;s world perspective. <br><br>Love your videos!! Have been binge watching them.
He comes across as someone who is deeply insecure about what other people think of him but doesn&#39;t know how to act, so he does the most toxic shit imaginable then wonders why those people don&#39;t want to be his friend. Literal 5-year-old behaviour lmao. He is also very emotional but I bet he thinks he comes across as stoic and rational, like in those &quot;files on top of files&quot; rants to Pyro he seems almost manic. He has an air of sadness about him idk why, like he has sad eyes. I don&#39;t feel sorry for him at all but he must&#39;ve learned to act like that from somewhere
Mika you are beyond talented in your delivery and thoughtful takes. I really love the way you consider everything from both a source backed understanding of arguments and how people use certain language to illicit certain reactions but also the emotional and social side you bring up that makes your videos really nuanced and interesting. You&#39;re awesome!!!!!
Makeup looking amazing as always 💛
Watching this video had me wondering on what would be the method that&#39;d be most effective for reporting internet news.. Recently, I had started watching a vtuber report on vtuber news who essentially just reads twitter updates on stream or company announcements and seldom providing his own opinion. Is vtubing the most safe way to have a personality that an audience can relate to while being anonymous? I know watching something emote and have a face can elicit more of a connection between the commentator and the person so I wonder if wearing a png costume really is The Move idk
Can we get a tier ranking of keemstar feuds?
It&#39;s sad how he seems to have convinced himself that he is some sort of news reporter, or at least someone who is making a valuable contribution to society.  Men will go to absurd lengths to put distance between themselves and &quot;feminine&quot; behavior like gossipping about drama, it must get quite exhausting.
i really enjoy watching your videos, i&#39;m not to well educated on rhetoric but this was super interesting",PT48M55S,0.9996

Well i&#39;m not happy with keem for bailing wings and boogie out. I&#39;m absolutely Is overjoyed that phil will never take the hand that could save him. Second bankruptcy here we come!!!
I agree with the people who say deny him a big payday. He&#39;s too much of an antisocial scumbag, he doesnt deserve it.
Keem knows Piggy won&#39;t apologize. He is just keeping him in the spotlight to get under Piggy&#39;s thin skin.
Asking DSP to apologize is like asking a nymphomaniac to live a life of chastity.
Man I haven&#39;t eaten these wonderful shroomz in a while but Phil is so damn funny and bizarre in all the wrong places
Watch the third host be perry caravello
Rtu being the 3rd person would be a good idea. All 3 of them could trash dsp for one whole podcast.
My predictions:<br>Dsp will play victim and say theyre dragging him into it he wants nothing to do with it i did nothing wrong im not apologising i didnt do anything etc. But also keem is punching down im just a little guy leave me alone wah wah but also give me 300 dollars every day snort
Oh Keem plz daddy, plz get your connections moving and do an audit on DSP&#39;s bankrupcy
😂A 48 hour ultimatum for an apology knowing Phil&#39;s Ego?<br>Keem, you&#39;re better off just doing the podcast without him and having him cry when he actually sees the money on playback. The only reason Phil is really still around is for the salt.
Anyone but Ethan Ralph god no not that degenerate.
Anyone else than Phil would be great. Phil is boring bottom of the barrel lolcow.
LOL even keem knows that the king of all lolcows is dsp - he gave gout boi a life line to make his shows the bomb. What lawlcow podcast can exist without the guy who masterbated on stream with the webcam AHN? XD
Lol he will rage about this on level wahn pahdcast and why Keem owe him an apology instead 😂😂. Welcome to the demented world is Dave.
airsoft fatty would be great
A tell all from Leanna might be nice Keem. Reach out to her, maybe throw her that cool 50K you were going to give Phil. I’d talk about my worst ex for that much…just sayin. 🤷🏽‍♂️
With as big of an ego that DSP has there&#39;s no way he&#39;ll ever apologize.",PT15M44S,0.9781

Who are supposed to trust I feel sorry for that old guy and think keemstar a prick then find out the old guy doxes people , I hate keemstar then h3h3 sinks to the same depths, I feel for zaptie and find out he’s a shitty friend and I used to watch I’malex (only because he was on memelous’ channel I don’t watch his own stuff, who do u trust?? I bet a lot of this guys are desperate to dox or swat or pizza 🍕 overload nics place
how comes ur friendly with him now tho 💀
Sir you&#39;re a hypocrite just like you accuse others of
Didn&#39;t you just appear on Mom&#39;s Basement? <br>Just want to know what changed... hmm
Boy nick now you cape for keem lol
Did JustDestiny ever sue Keem? He should have and I feel like he would win
Dude was trying to protect the kids man
Loved the video. Keem is an idiot if he thinks this is okay.
I literally when at one of Keems fan meetups ran up on Keem called him a bitch and called his security to kick me out he is only a tough guy online
man h3 has gotten worse than this
i always feel bad when i see the old dude
Wow this guy is a badass :)
Sooo.. thats what happened to JustDestiny. I know he made a mistake, but jeez keemstar 🙄
Wait what is doxxing defined by
This is my favorite video from Nick
God this still pisses the fuck out of me! But it’s still a damn good video.
What was the music played at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0qNsFTaj24&amp;t=43m02s"">43:02</a>?
It’s only a matter of time before these guys end up in jail
Does anyone know the song used at the very beginning? The one that’s behind Nick reading out the definitions?
Who is that old man in the video? :/
if i subscribe to keemstar and the next day unsub repeatedly he does like this? should we try? =) just kiddin ghaghagha
Does NCO stand for new commentary order?
Great video
God, it&#39;s weird seeing a guy like TRO have to be fallible. I know no human being is infallible but still, it&#39;s a little surreal seeing him have to take accountability for something.
Keem&#39;s a joke and shouldn&#39;t be regarded as a news source. As Jackmaate said he&#39;s too biased and it&#39;s so obvious. When he like you he&#39;ll defend you&#39;re actions but when he doesn&#39;t he won&#39;t, all you have to do is look at the whole Deji situation. Granted Deji was definitely wrong but he was so biased in the way he reported on him afterwards and why because he&#39;s better friends with KSI than Deji. He also called Esports talk an industry shill? Like wtf, Jake lucky is a better news source as he at least states what happened and then clearly says when he is stating his opinion. Why call him an industry shill oh jeez IDK probably cause he&#39;s reported some negative news on Faze and 100T whos owners are friends with Keem. He&#39;s a hypocrite and a joke to the whole journalism industry.
Honestly I found keem when he posted the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bankpop"">#bankpop</a> thing? It was completely unnecessary and disrespectful, like I know Twitter is horrible and they’re are a huge amount of toxic kpop fans but you don’t gotta come for all of us? If you don’t like it that’s amazing but leave the ppl who do alone.
Keem is an actual Disney villain
What are you doing....? Seriously. While I beyond respect your approach and the depth and complexity of the issues you cover as well as the beautiful way you put the videos together. You should be working at S4 or JSOC or something exposing THAT shit your waaaaay to good for this JV team stuff. Just an opinion, we all got em. Keep em coming, please!

I don&#39;t like keemstar as much as the next person but God damn i gotta say i respect how well he took all the shit he was getting
Ngl the videos are funny but I&#39;m on no one side
I’m bemused why he became famous
its 2022 and this rat is still on youtube
BRO IT&#39;S SO FUNNY BECAUSE THE WORLD HAS BECOME MORE SHIT AFTER KEEM RETIRED 💀💀💀
this is it boys.... this is the beginning of a new age... a age of purity.... with Keem gone a large fraction of toxicity goes with him.
now we need 98% of the people that celebrated to retire as well
Bruh nothing changed since he left
Meh, we&#39;ll see if its true.
lol people celebrated too early about Keemstar’s retirement
Thank god
February may&#39;ve just started but its gonna happen next momth
Not going to lie I kinda liked keem

Man, if he does all I&#39;m going to say is that Internet drama will be a lot less interesting with this mf no longer lurking to drop a hot take of some facts
What’s crazy all those people saying they didn’t care but got keemstar notifications on hard asf like Twitter users are slow
I dislike keemstar but I respect his mental fortitude.
Hes not actually retiring.
Whether you liked him or not, I think the overwhelming hate he has is funny and sad.
Are you yet another cringey keem alog?
Watching keemstar last this long was like picking cactus fruit.
The Internet Needs To Stop Being Evil To Keemstar When He Retires <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23apologisetokeemstar"">#ApologiseToKeemstar</a>
Don’t really want him to retire but if scarce comes back full time everyone’s gonna go to him I think Atleast. I don’t think a new host will keep keens channel alive very long and the channels gonna die sooner or later.
WOOOO yeah surprise WoaCB appearance my favorite
put keem in the mgs 3 ending this is tragic
what exactly is he retiring from
Bro the Patrick and SpongeBob rap is fire af
What a sad display from the people happy Keem is leaving<br><br>Not because I liked keem, f*ck that slime<br><br>But because they think THEY WON<br>No you idiots Keem has won<br><br>Those people giving him attention for fucking 13 years is what made him able to retire without issues and this reaction only confirms it<br><br>That dude may be a f*cking piece of slimey shit with zero to none positives but he played the internet for 13 years and those idiots will always deny it, just wait when another troll takes his place and we will be back to square one lol<br><br>But hey I am not on twitter I just like to watch their reaction to anything and it makes my day lmfao
you know ngl despite &quot;twittards&quot; being happy about keem&#39;s retirement, the internet eint getting any better and first of all no matter how much people hate keem atleast he didnt btch about people hating him and just continued delivering news like his show intended and i know why people hate keem * and i REALLY DO but heres the thing... people makes mistakes, so i just feel bad for the guy getting this much hate specially the daughter comment like, i now he deserves something but not this much jesus fcking comedown &quot;twittards&quot;*
I love and hate Keemstar, he is reasonable, but is also constantly looking for trouble, i feel its a good time now than ever to just stop doing drama alerts.<br>Drama is just boring these days and most 13 y/o girls argue about anything<br><br>I love the fact that basicly everyone hates him, i&#39;m sure he is a good friend, but he does not understand what boundaries are
HA! The &quot;Thank god&quot; part got me! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj6BWMPNbn4&amp;t=5m55s"">5:55</a> Reach that milestone, dude! lol
wow, I am just surprised people actually use twitter! wth!
don&#39;t care what anyone tells me. he killed Etika, i&#39;m grateful he&#39;s going
Keem seems to get to much hate the guy was ok and has been around for a decent portion of most of our live s
I didn&#39;t realize Keem was in his 40s... really strange that someone that age made a career out of following mostly teenage/early 20s drama.
Keemstar on YouTube is a plague<br>Keemstar on Twitter is a blessing<br>Know the difference
i honestly couldn’t care less whether he stays or retires
bye keemstar
Glad he will still be on twitter yea people from twitter don&#39;t deserve peace and happiness

Good. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s retiring. Not only so we don&#39;t have to see him anymore but also so Ethan will finally shut up.
Honestly keemstar is funny as fuck starting so much entertainment
He absolutely bodied that Katie idiot fucking hell 😂
Leafyishear for the host of DramaAlert? Id like to see that tbh

Dumbass
You are a menace to society.
It doesn&#39;t matter if you apologize, you still did it - you jumped not thinking of consequences, and you hurt someone who did nothing wrong. Apologize all you like, it won&#39;t change the fact - YOU DID IT.
Can&#39;t believe he only checked if it was true after he reported on it
Just take three sips of beer
You&#39;re an idiot
Idiota
Doesnt he normally tell his news prematurely without learning the whole truth anyway? I wished that he could say sorry to all those youtubers he played in part hes destroyed. But how many times can you say sorry for the same thing with different people and think that&#39;s ok? You would think he would learn from his mistakes but I guess not.
this is worse than the james charles apology
Bro, You messed up. This man you harrased is dead.
your a fucking loser, still wont forget this.
Your&#39;re an absolute piece of trash. You&#39;ve falsely accused many people of doing bad things that they didn&#39;t do and it completely ruined them. It&#39;s best to shut your mouth unless you KNOW for SURE. The fact that you kept making false accusations even though many of them have been proven wrong, proves you don&#39;t give a crap. You also refuse to take down the videos that have been debunked. You are literally a piece of sh#!%.
You can say anything you want but everyone knows that you don’t care what happened to him your just trying to save your career, you will get what you deserve one day
Bro it’s crazy that he was barley saying sorry and just saying I’m happy I took responsibility. That’s actually crazy.
I will not forgive you
He fired the guy who told him it was the wrong guy? Fucking idiot
I’m glad I’ve never followed any of your shit. You’re a clown. A huge piece of shit actually. I’m glad you’re not a relevant part of social media anymore. You’re a nobody now. Just as you should be. Cringestar.
Bro said he feels horrible my guy is sitting there with popcorn and is prolly eating away like he&#39;s about to watch the world cup bro blamed the team instead of the team
Bro swearing basically in every sentence
Bro watches up and down before crossing the street
This popped up after me not seeing it for 6 years, still think your scum and your show is ass😂
Leave youtube please.
I don’t give a fuck what you say your a piece of fucking garbage and the fact that you didn’t get sued or arrested for this is shocking to me
Of course this video is still monetized
You are a jack ass
This should be a stain on you till your dieing day.<br>Your words mean nothing, just a punk kid with a keyboard and no heart.
He died 2 weeks ago
Hope what you did haunts you forever, you he probably thought about what you did for the rest of his life you piece of shit, quit yt
You don&#39;t work hard on your show men look at your tweets about amouranth husband was abusing her and then you said but dude your the worst fucker I have ever seen you didn&#39;t do your research so yes your stupid ashole and a piece of shit.
And now he’s gone…
How does he feel now that he has passed away, I hope Keemstar lives forever in guilt and regret, I hope that everyday, he sees what he has done, guilt is worse than death, that is what I want you keemstar to live with.
and now hes dead
you have ruined so many peoples lives because of you
damn i find it funny af that people are still commenting on this vid calling keem garbage XD
And now he’s dead.
this isnt something you accuse someone off, unless yo have very firm proof.  its literally disgusting bro.  to ruin someones life likethat.  he passed away about a weeek ago.  so you cant hurt him any lnger.
Piece of garbage human being
You seem like a pretty big piece of shit still... seems like nothing has changed huh?
Rest in peace. We miss him.
Just remember that keemstar is a raging tard
This was litterally a problem in the community until he passed a couple of days ago. You tarnished a man&#39;s complete life and fucked it up until he was taken from this world. This is but one example of a laundry list of terrible things you&#39;ve done. You suck and continue to suck even in current day. I know you won&#39;t read this comment or care if you do, but I hope you get what you deserve for the damage you&#39;ve done to so many for money. You&#39;re a scumbag and deserve literally nothing in this world.
Now he&#39;s dead...
Guys... We lost him... 😢
Still dunno how he could do this with sincerity with all his promotional stuff at the front of the screen and popcorn rly.<br><br>You did not deserve to outlive him.

This Biden lover is retarded because he bring up how old the article is about qxc but fails to realize that speed is younger than qxc was when he said homophobic slur. Why does it matter how long ago it was it should only matter how old the person was and if they should know better
All these people commenting here about how keem is wrong about bringing up old articles and trying to prove that people do not change(which is just purely illogical point), it is clearly showing that u just don&#39;t want to accept the truth that xqc was wrong this time
Yeah but Keem wasn’t saying Xqc was homophobic. Like wtf? He was just saying that hey xqc you also used to participate in bad trash talk when you were younger but a 17 year old getting canceled over trash talk isn’t cool. <br>It’s funny because people hate Keemstar to the point where even when he’s in the right they can’t admit it because they have to hate him. I get it but come on, don’t make yourself look like a fool over it.
How many time does hasan say &quot;literally&quot; in this clip? It&#39;s like valley girl &quot;likes&quot; but way more annoying imo* I&#39;m not a destiny fan this is just truth. Now that u realize he overuses this word u will be annoyed
Keemstar doxed a family after calling a disabled kid named and bullshitted his way through Etika. His reach is terrible here.
Id prefer the 40 year old man arguing with teenagers about racism rather than dating them, unfortunately keem does both.
Xqc didnt say the f Word tho? What he did wasnt even that bad he just Said he would like to suck one which yea its inappropriate but its not comparable to the f Word
keep makes a point he said if you going at ishowspeed then keep the same energy
The fact that we care about grown ass men playing video games is crazy bruh ahahahahaha
Hassan and xqc are both liberal douches
He posted clips of him in RP? What a fucking weirdo
Next creator clash Hasan should fight Keem
keem took so many L&#39;s its sad
Keemsore really tried comparing a clip of xqc saying  “psshhh women. I’m kidding” and laughter…. To “IS A WOMAN TALKING TO ME RIGHT NOW? IS THAT A FUCKING FEMALE? GO WASH YOUR HUSBAND DISHES” 🤦🏽‍♀️ that guys head is the densest thing on earth
XQC vs Keemstar? Let&#39;s Go!
Didn’t iddubbs make a content cop where he even said that keem would go after a guy just because he talked in a negative way about him and keem is still doing it god hypocrisy is amazing
Also what xqc said wasn’t even that bad, people tell each other to suck a d all the time and he blurted it out without thinking about it while keenstar said the n word on purpose knowing that the player was black and he didn’t even care
they tried to use the way back machine for Joe Rogan too so
Holy shit this mf calling strangers lame on main someone cancel this fool
“Hassan reacts to Keemstar on QXC” …why? lol all clout demons trading gossip content for their communities🤣🤣
Hypcroite
I for one can barely understand what XQC, but his take here is perfect. change can always occur, and mostly its a good thing. but keemstar is acting like he&#39;s still in highschool, literally.
Who even watches that gnome anymore
Bro Keem is like 40 years old, anything he says or does on the internet is pure cringe
XQC was so smooth with that video. No nonsense, just a quick reminder to keemstar that he’s a piece of shit. Lmao
People need to mass drag Keemstar for all the things he has said and done
I thought keemstar was dead? Now he&#39;s desperate for more viewers so he starts drama w/ xqc. <b>That&#39;s every streamer logic to get famous.</b>
Keem is not a cool person ... guys its not cool to hate people too BUT sometimes it seems like Keem wants this hate and he gets it . But Why ? We should just ignore him and let his Social Media accounts die out
Keemstar is the last person id listen to about LGBTQ issues, no shot he actually cares lol (also I appreciate it when you put the chatter on the screen, makes it easier to follow)
actual good take
Keemstar saying no one cares about trash talking unless it&#39;s black streamers 👀 he&#39;s not wrong
mindset never changes but the way you act could
I&#39;m certain that the vocal minority of extremely annoying liberals might still be pissy about the past, but any rational leftist/feminist understands that teenagers say shit and that people mature overtime. It sometimes feels like this annoying and ultra American brand of &#39;woke liberals&#39; actively fight against any form of progress... I&#39;m sure that a younger XQC said a bunch of tasteless shit when he was a younger, rage-filled top player but I&#39;m proud of him for changing and growing and anyone with an earnest interest in seeing people change for the better would agree... seems like some people are only interested in having people to yell at.
imagine going back and showing clips of your bad moment when you have have done all of the shit that keem has done. god he is the worst of the worst, I really hope that this dosent die quick that way more people learn about keem and he gets called out and shit on by a hole new part of the internet
Keemstar has to be the pettiest  mf on the planet
Donnie... Sadge
Hasans best Capitalism take tbh 😂<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZFQ_1qMYMU&amp;t=6m45s"">6:45</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZFQ_1qMYMU&amp;t=6m45s"">6:45</a>
I haven’t watched keemstar since 2016 and he’s still the same just watching that clip of keemstar reminded me of those old toxic drama days
Keem larping as Macho Man in the thumbnail 😂
Derpstar absolutely has no values. He shows it every day
XQC didn&#39;t answer Keemstar at all. Keemstar didn&#39;t want to show that XQC is a homophobe he just wanted to show that IShowSpeed was trash talking and isnt a sexist person on a day to day basis. Just like XQC years ago was not a homophobe but trash talked in a VIDEO GAME
I literally used lame to stop saying homophobic slurs. I’ll never stop saying the R word because I am r worded. That’s how it works right?
Yea xqc is the last guy I wanna hear from when it comes to all the women stereotype jokes
People are so sensitive nowadays bruh
hassan one of the biggest hypocrites? so speed trash talk, months ago apparently, and he admit he was in the wrong(lets not forgive)<br>xqc trash talks  years ago, admit he was wrong (lets forgive). make it make sense.not a fan of either xqc or speed dont watch their content, but logic doesnt aply to your comments and never will because u cant change hassan
Cuckstar lmao. I admire Hasan spreading love and understanding.
Is Hassan not fasting??? AstagfurAllah 😂😂

H3 eggs keem then acts like keem started it and is in the wrong
i love the fact that h3h3 has been calling his own wife a horse considering no one else has been saying that he&#39;s the only one who saw keem send him a image of a horse and went &quot;oh so he&#39;s calling my wife a horse&quot; like the mental gymnastics this dude does he should get a gold medal also its nice to see what process ethan uses to put words in keems mouth
Lmfao ethan needs to bring that keemstar puppet back. It literally hilarious <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hypocrite"">#Hypocrite</a>
Ethans Keem puppet skit was soo funny
October is one of the coolest month that you can hang out with your friends 😁
Lol
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrO9Uu3EDX8&amp;t=8m52s"">8:52</a><br>IM DEAD!!!!!!! 💀💀💀💀 lmaooooo
This is probably the most bias comment section. It’s funny how they say that Ethan starts drama, but dude, keem is the one who fucking tweets about Ethan everyday.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrO9Uu3EDX8&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a> Gotta love how Hila is sitting there like &quot;Why did I marry this man&quot;.
Keem is a idoit
nfkrz made a better keemstar
I guess H3 vs. Keemstar is over...
So is just keemstar getting butthurt for a joke
god its sad to see ethans fall from grace
I dislike keem and ethan equally, but if ethan started the drama, it makes me dislike ethan more than keem.
this makes me so mad, u have to be such a loser to make fun of someone that has a uncontrollable tic, tourettes isnt something to joke about, no one finds it funny. Keemstar needs to get a life.
The community, the community, was calling Ethan a hypocrite, not Keem<br><br>Keem reported on the fact that the community, the community, was calling Ethan a hypocrite <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Because he totally is
I listened back to the baited podcast with ethan and I found myself liking keem more than him.....
I literally just watch this video for super cut of the puppet lmfao it’s so funny when Ethan does his voice 😂😂😂
I really want to see Keemstar and H3H3 get in the Boxing Match
I used to be obsessed with this sorta drama all throughout high school, and now...this really is the most petty shit I&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s just sad knowing these people have families and a following.
I know hes fucking with Keemstar but that Puppetry is horrendous. I&#39;ve only been doing it for 7 months and I want to wash my eyes out after seeing him disrespect the art
Holy fuck Ethan has become a lol cow
I cant stand H3H3 or keemstar, but after watching the trilogy H3 made on him and content cop, I can clearly see how keemstar is in the wrong
i love the part where keem talks about the art of war<br><br>#1 he&#39;s actually right<br><br>#2 ricky&#39;s response (lmao)
Bruh, Ethans got fat fr
It’s funny how everyone is taking this seriously when Ethan was obviously joking
Oh my God, he is actually obsessed.
Sad, I thought this was over after the 15th time
He can&#39;t even move Keemstar&#39;s mouth the right way.
Man these folks are insufferable.
You know what they say, imitation is the best form of flattery
H3H3 show&#39;s in a anti racist <br>In black face .<br>Only to say that are anti Semitic .<br>Sorry but how many of you did read the ZOHAR , Talmud and tanakh
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrO9Uu3EDX8&amp;t=5m08s"">5:08</a> well I hate to say it .<br>But he really did nail the full show.
I have two questions to ask you all.<br>For how long it&#39;s this drama going .<br>And how did it started over what .
They&#39;re both so pathetic 🤦🏻‍♀️
I forgot there was still drama between these two
Off subject but I wanna know if you truly enjoy making this type of content. I wanna know if your truly happy about doing it n all &lt;:)
we just gonna gloss over that guy accusing Ethan of coming to a black empowerment event in blackface??
Man hila just looks so uncomfortable around Ethan like he’s keeping her hostage or something, awkward laughing and just the bored expressions.
Damn at least H3 didn’t half ass when he memed on keem. His shit was hella lame at least Ethan’s was funny I mean shir
am i the only one who wants you to keep covering this",PT11M5S,0.9772

But hey, this guy who attacked him saying that his videos are fake and that Jimmy wasn&#39;t in them, I&#39;m sorry, but as people you don&#39;t know when you&#39;re going to feel bad and you&#39;re not going to be willing. If Jimmy left, it&#39;s because he felt bad and as a team he knows he can count on them, but the other guy&#39;s bad, that means he didn&#39;t know how to work as a team. but there was a moment of tension between drama and mr beast but Jimmy was very angry
Same
Crazy how everyone never prays for your success, only pray for you to fall.
Maybe Deji would&#39;ve won if he trained instead of playing Fortnite 💀
Mr Beast seems super legit and is genuinely nice
ooh kay that should not have been done
istg this man is just jealous and mad at jimmy because he has such a sucsessful carrer and he just tries to ruin
Not to much on mrbeast.
Wow look at these stans from 3 years ago LOL.  the man DOES fake his videos.
sthu stupid news channel mr beast is 100%
Who is MrBeast talking abt?
He explained. You almost killed his channel
This aged well 💀
E
Anyone else here from a Tik Tok that explained he was talking about Karl?
mr best is chill
Damn the amount of people who said that it was Karl who said these thing drove me to watch this to find the facts
deji showing up is so unnatural 💀
Why did people make it seem like this was about Karl
So you guys are just going to believe this random guy🤨
I like how Jimmy immediately shuts down keems dramatics
Is this about Karl
THE ENDING LMAO
I support mrbeast still
Who else thought he was talking about Karl jacobs?
“Ok you’re blowing it out of proportion I’ll explain it” ain’t that the truth
Why does mr beast sometimes sound like dream and I’m not a dream Stan I just hear it
Nah anyone that thinks mr.beast videos are fake is a fake fan bro and they can honsetly go screw themselves cuz mr.beast is such a good dude he doesnt deserve that
No one has commented in 2 years.
It’s impossible to even blame jimmy for being this mad
Mr. Beast has a platform your legit the leach keem he legit has like 50 mil he probably would have made an argument on his channel and your the one benefiting from this situation because you&#39;re the one gett ing the views and likes
man i watched him since he made fun of intros and there was a kid fucking his pillow
bruh keemstar interrupting mr beast every time he talks 💀
Keem now mrbeast is way bigger then you will ever be never doubt him
Mr beast talks facts 🤣😂 but funny
“I don’t want to ramble on and on”-continues to bring it up 2 more times in depth.
Yes
Who is here after Mr Beast hit 60+ mil subs 3 years later?
So now killer keemstar is trying to destroy mrbeast
This is the most angry I’ve seen mr beastie
hey now ur a keemstar
54 mill subs latter
uhhh wtf
We all know he takes his vid and I went to slow Mo on his vids and in one vid someone threw a dart but  then Chris threw a other dart to pop the thing and you can see in the desert inland YOU CAN SEE CHRIS VAPE AND CHANLER KN AN OTHER VID
Mr Beast fans are so toxic his videos r fake😂😂😂
Morgz is Fake<br>MrBeast Is Real 100%<br>Jaystation is fake

The Keemstar and Repzion Confrontation (Unplanned Livestream),"I did not think I'd be hosting such a friendly conversation between Keemstar and Repzion, but it turned into a trainwreck I just couldn't look away from. Discussing everything from Onision content, grooming, personal grudges, and even dirty socks. Context: I decided to go live on Sunday with no plan other than discuss my thoughts on the Jeffree Star / Chris Hansen interview and ended up streaming for 12 hours with a variety of youtubers stopping by to weigh in. I had Mimi and Shannon on when Keem wanted to put in his two cents about the Jeffree/Hansen interview as well. Given that he was going to interview Jeffree as well, I put him on. Eventually, Repzion was also in the chat and they went at it each other a few times so I figured I'd invite Repzion to sound off. I'll be editing more highlights for the next couple days, but if you'd like to see the whole stream, it's up on my patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/36481543

Also in the stream: Creepshow Art, TehMimi - and short cameos from Petty Paige, Tommy C, and Nicholas Deorio

Other segments from this live:
Petty Paige on Jeffree Star's Intimidation of Creators and Influence (livestream clip) - https://youtu.be/bCYS2-uN6zw
The Roast of Hansen's Jeffree Star Interview - Creepshow Art, TehMimi, Keemstar, + Petty Paige - https://youtu.be/NzpB30RxCHE",95533,3684,1700,2020-04-28T20:58:16Z,"This past Sunday, I decided to do a livestream that I could have not predicted would go on to last 12 hours and bring in a variety of other creators. This is one of the segments from the stream I want to post from it before we get into more serious mode. It felt like a trainwreck I kinda wanted to extinguish but also wanted to keep watching? More context in the description above! I promise there&#39;s a pay off once the socks come up lol. I&#39;m working on editing a segment discussing Dahvie Vanity and also considering an edit of creators talking about their thoughts on the Jeffree/Hansen interview so keep an eye out. Otherwise, the whole guy is up on my patreon. Cheers!
keemstar auto loses when he starts insulting. kind of like that onision fellow lmao.
Anyone that actually pays attention to this shit is actually lame af.
The moderator sucked, and the side gal sucked. Keem lays out blunt attacks and <br><br>           Repzion totally folds for ex: you started &quot;dating&quot; your girl before you started dating her. Rep&#39;s response to this is such a b-made move &quot;I&#39;ll get my girl on the call!! Girl come her!!!&quot; Lmao. Then the girlfriend/or and the other girl moderator just interjects with things that don&#39;t get to any heart of any matter. &quot;Guys let&#39;s stop the hate boners&quot; it&#39;s like when two guys get into a physical fight and before things get settled with a few harsh blows it only fans confusion and incites more emotional anger, thereby only furthering a grudge.
Not Keemstar being prophetic about crazy Maya but in the wrong damn ways
Yoooo the chat had me DECEASED
Keem...what a loser! People definitely make money doing a hobby. I guess he&#39;s never heard of etsy before. That man depends on youtube cuz what the heck else is the schmuck gna do as a job?! ....get him rep!!
Watching this now is so fuckin funny when keemstar is trying to come for rep about his gf&#39;s age when keem is dating a 20 year old now lmaooo
I hate Keemstar. Like I wish people would just stand in a line, and everybody take a shot. He is so goddamn annoying
Like your  Sherbert hair
god i love Repzion
Keemstar has a crappy mic for a rich boy
Omg Keem is soo pathetic it’s annoying 😫 he tries so hard 😫
Did either of these asshats ever apologize for spreading the bull accusations against Tobuscus?
Push back is unnecessary when the evidence is readily available on video made public.
repzion is obsessed with onision and capitalized off hate videos on him for years<br>he&#39;s a fucking loser
Gods... Keem, just shut up, continually derailed the proceedings, got personal like he had a vendetta and when told to wrap it up and act right, he could not help himself but to dig and take more potshots, stop... Just stop! <br>Then got butthurt when Rep said he didn&#39;t personally consider youtube a full-time job then had to do that small dog act, bark, and run with the dirty socks comment.<br>It was good you didn&#39;t kick him off because we all got to see and nonsensical and petty this clown was, stay on topic! XD
I wish this was longer 😷
I never heard Repzion so mad before👀😂 He kept it together💯
Gods every time I hear Keem talk I want to go deaf. I would forever watch Rep before Keem. Keem is a lil B*tch. He whines so much.
I’m gonna go watch this grass video brb
1. Repzion always shows receipts for what he says.<br>2. Keem is seriously grasping at straws that are ridiculous.
Keem is so annoying
Keemstar adores his straw man arguments
I fucking hate Keemstar
Wow im like holding my hand over my mouth through this entire thing XD its nice to hear repzions answers, and edwins faces XD
This was 8 months ago and I still wanna kick keem&#39;s ass. He is so stupid.
&quot;I have to go I&#39;ve realized I didn&#39;t actually have a point.&quot;
Keemstar defending onision shows hes a grooming supoorter
&quot;I&#39;m going to need to look a bit deeper into this story&quot; -&gt;Keem ... BECAUSE YOU DIDN&#39;T RESEARCH THE STORY TO BEGIN WITH. ALL YOU KNEW IS YOU DON&#39;T LIKE REP CAUSE HE CALLED YOU OUT, KEEM! YOU DON&#39;T EVEN WATCH REP&#39;S CONTENT. YOU HAVE NO RECIEPTS AND ONLY PETTY INSULTS!!
Rewatching this reminds me how Keemstar is annoying and doesn&#39;t let people talk... <b>sigh</b>
&quot;Let&#39;s all take the blood out of our hate boners, and into our minds&quot; VERY WELL SAID lmao 😆
Keem is SO fucking hypocritical... last live he was screaming about &#39;Anti-O&#39; people calling EVERYONE a pedø and, now he&#39;s calling Repzion a pedo. Lol.
Keemstar, your breath smells strangely...&quot;oniony&quot;. 🤔
Keemstar not understanding you can make money from hobbies 💀
Repzion was mopping the floor with KeemStar from the first second and I am so here for it.
Keem is only able to make second-hand comments, he doesn&#39;t do any research himself. And he wonders why nobody can ever take him seriously? The guy is a walking gossip tabloid with an ego far surpassing his underdeveloped brain.
Yeah I know this is old news, but keemstar is like that guy that hangs out in a world of online teenagers because no group of real men will accept him
I fucking hate Keemstar so much. He&#39;s such a prick. I am surprised that he isn&#39;t with LegendaryLeah
Keemstar is annoying as hell. I said what I said.
Keem is in this for the money.. I can&#39;t stand his show
how have i only just seen this - dyinggg lol
This is chaos... Continue gentlemen. 🤓
Keem falling and grasping on to anything is funny to watch 🤣😂
Honestly, I can’t stand either of these two. They are both condescending. The only way Repzion is a bit better is that he actually does research.
Ugh no wonder Keem likes Onion
does keem think that anything you do that brings in extra income makes it a job? i like to draw and make crafts in my free time that people will sometimes buy. Its additional income but i would hardly call it a job lol
Is this the real housewives of YouTube
Let’s all get the blood out of our boners and back into our heads 😂 best part of this whole thing that and keem finally leaving
An absolute masterpiece",PT31M30S,-0.991
Keemstar Still Living Rent Free in DSP’s Head,"CREDITS

I honestly can&#39;t tell who is a worse liar and more contradicting than the other. DSP or Dale (LTG)?
I&#39;ve never in my life seen a grown man talk so incessantly by himself.
I think the reason Keemstar gets away with the asshole and DPS doesn&#39;t is because Keemstar does actually know when to turn off the personality and be real with people. DSP isn&#39;t playing a character though. He really is just a giant piece of shit.
Because he&#39;s still bagging on level one
Both men are in their 40&#39;s.<br>One is broke, constantly begging for tips, lives in his castle of glass and echo chamber.<br>The other is retired with &#39;fuck you money&#39; and remains more relevant than the other.<br><b>Who is the nobody</b>
There&#39;s so many things to unpack here.<br><br>&quot;The guy got upset about it because he&#39;s incredibly sensitive&quot;<br><br>This is coming from the manchild who literally holds a grudge for years just so he can throw it back in someone else&#39;s face. See: Projared.<br><br>&quot;Who gives a fuck about the guy&quot;<br><br>More people than give a fuck about you, even considering the lolcow status.<br><br>&quot;I turned it into a positive [...] I even got the name of this podcast [from him]&quot;<br><br>Congrats. You used a statement he used to deride you and used it as your own. This does nothing to prove it wrong or remove attention from him. From how on, everyone will see this podcast title as &quot;What Keem used to ridicule Phil and he used it as a moment of attention&quot;. The epitome of &quot;any attention is good attention&quot;. Welcome to high school girl status.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s posting publicly about it [...] The professional has a way to do it&quot;<br><br>And this is how other content creators typically reach out to others. While some do reach out through DMs, some also reach out publicly when they have a presence. Both DSP and Keem both have a public presence, so neither way is necessarily wrong. One can argue that Keem was baiting but DSP&#39;s account of this is utter bullshit. If you don&#39;t like it, just say you don&#39;t like it and make it known that you&#39;d rather do it undisclosed. However, DSP&#39;s reaction to this is to bitch and moan and expect the other person to read his mind and expect to always, under all circumstances, reach out to him to his fucking hotmail email for literally anything. Even if it&#39;s for renting out his foreclosed condo.<br><br>This guy&#39;s simply out of touch with not only reality but the social sphere he&#39;s cemeneted himself into. It&#39;s fucking pathetic for a supposed adult whose age starts with a 4.
The fact that DSP took the name of his podcast from Keemstar&#39;s comment shows quite clearly that his &quot;King of Hate&quot; moniker was also stolen from the FGC who called him such.<br>So DSP doesn&#39;t have his own ideas. He just steals from others.
this guy loves listening to himself ramble
Imagine taking keemstars side over dsp 😂😂😂😂😂.  Gotta be 11 years old OR LESS 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
&quot;I was talking mad sh!t about this guy(which I&#39;m allowed to) and when he talked sh!t back I called it punching down because he isn&#39;t allowed to and I&#39;m a huge man baby&quot;
“I’ve changed a lot” <a href=""https://youtu.be/hquAZa55zgU"">https://youtu.be/hquAZa55zgU</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9-r3VD7NhM&amp;t=0m27s"">0:27</a>
I agree DSP, you need psychological help. You need to go to a loved one and tell them &quot;I have been scamming dents for the past 16 years and blowing all the money on DoorDash, Gin, and WWE Champions pulls. This is what I was doing with my life I&#39;ve been given, I need an intervention.&quot;
The Toilet of YouTube calling Keemstar the &quot;Toilet of YouTube&quot; is absolutely hysterical to me. I&#39;m not by any means a fan of Keemstar, but I&#39;ll take 100 Keemstars over 1 DSP any day.
&quot;Keemstar doesn&#39;t affect me in any way.&quot; Says the guy who changed the same of his podcast to something that Keemstar tweeted.
As much as I hate DSP, I do have to agree with him about the way Keemstar offered him that 50k. Should have been private and not out in the open so everyone can see it.  Perhaps contact Phil&#39;s manager to negotiate the deal. DSP could have held out for more with a few perks. If not, decline the offer and nobody would have known. It was done poorly.
Phil and Andy warski are pause Andy’s
It really bothers him that Keemstar is just as hated as him but has somehow ended up 100 times more successful.
He&#39;s excited to morally grandstand about how morally superior he is to Keemstar.<br><br>But if Keem reacts, he&#39;s &quot;punching down&quot; on poor Phil the victim.
Anyone who believes Phil can be objective in any way about Keemstar, I have a bridge to sell you too.
DSP throwing stones in his glass house when he&#39;s accusing anyone else of being overly sensitive.
&quot;So many people hate him.&quot; Just because you hate him, doesn&#39;t mean everyone else does Phil.
LOL. Our man Phil is just slightly worse than the real Dr Phil.<br><br>Oh, that&#39;s not fair.<br>Dr Phil has a job.<br><br>Get a job Phil.<br><br>Gad bless DSPTIM101
Everyone does everything wrong except phil.  Pretty cool right?
I&#39;m very different now. I don&#39;t make those kind of things jokes anymore. <br><br>Also DSP: &quot;Alright boys prepare the slave trade we&#39;re selling her right on for profits!&quot;
Phil has a dangerous lack of self-awareness
I find it funny that Phil claims Keemstar is a nobody to him when DSP has been a nobody to the gaming community since he first started. People laughed at him and called him the joke of the FGC and even said it was insulting for him to say he represented the youtube gaming community as a whole.
&quot;Why would I delete those videos? I won&#39;t run from my past or act like it didn&#39;t happen&quot;...but, you do. And sure what&#39;s in the past is in the past, but when you still have say those Dead Space videos on a channel you&#39;re still active on, you&#39;re still making adrev on them and showing potential sponsors your proud of what you did (though we already know he is from all the times he defends them saying it was the comedy of the time and people should be okay with him doing because Howard Stern joked like that too)
Romance Kat
Wow
People who haven&#39;t changed are always the first to tell you how much they have changed... he documents his delusional thinking on a daily basis
Phil is the only person who can turn not having any sponsorships or alternative revenues streams into a brag.
Imagine turning down $50,000 because they don’t contact you right
“The guy is so sensitive” - Says the guy who has his YouTube chat locked down like a Police State.
How many times has Phil said that he would never mention Keem again? Same with Rich. Phil just can&#39;t help himself.
Yeah Keemstar doesnt do high quality content like Phil! 😂😂🤦🏻 he is so delusional its untrue.
40 years old
Sips gin
This guy really needs to see a doctor. He has serious lying problems. He not only lies to others but also lies to himself. He brainwashes himself to be a good man, but at the same time he keeps doing those bad things. He has not changed a bit at all and he still tries to pretend he has changed a lot. This guy really is one of kind and he is an extreme rare human being with such extremely delusional personality.
Concerted effort.
Delusion has a name, its Piggie.
phil wanted the 50k while controlling what dsp was asking him..... lol dsp talking about punching down
He wants to be professional yet cant save any money himself 😆
- &quot;Keemstar is ahorrible person! Disgusting, always exploiting people when they are down. He is unprofessional, he&#39;s always puching down to everyone arund him. He doesn&#39;t get anything from it, he&#39;s just a scumbag! I wanted nothing to do with him!&quot;<br><br>- &quot;All i know about Keemstar is my personal interactions and what I learned from the down the rabbit hole of Wingsofredemption!&quot;<br><br>- Another exemplre that Philzenegger doesn&#39;t listen to himself when he&#39;s talking.
It’s funny Phil thinks his reactions will bother Akeem...a f*cking millionaire who has mastered business and branding skills to get where he is. People on the Left, as usual, don’t like Keem, but Phil doesn’t seem to realize Keem is friends with tons of big name people...it’s how he gets info for his Drama Alert show. Both have been on YouTube forever...Phil is actually WORSE off than a decade ago, while Keem who hit bottom a few times early on has now reached some pretty massive heights, becoming rich and spreading around into lots of other things. <br>I never watched or really knew anyth about Keem until a few years back, and while I have only seen him for 3 years or so, I like the guy and haven’t really seen him do anything bad...but unlike baby Phil, I’m not sensitive,I like edginess in humor, I’m a Trump supporter, so I don’t buy into the Woke BS. It’s just hilarious he thinks anything he says or does would get under Akeem’s skin and that he’s sensitive. Lol. Sure Phil...could you Project your feelings any more than that? Because that’s all you ever do...again, as Leftists all do...Project their thoughts and actions onto others, The Right, in most cases. Phil is a massive Pussy and everyone knows it.<br>Keem has made millions over the same period he and Phil have been on youtube...meanwhile, Phil still must beg and badger subs to even have $5 to his name ever. We know he lies about his money, but I still see him as poor because he wastes it all, and he lives not even paycheck to paycheck, but day to day. What a moron. He wants to take on Keemstar, he will lose. He’s already lost before starting.
It’s about to turn into rent to own!<br>I think 🎉

&quot;I have the right to react to anything I want it&#39;s fair game&quot; Then what was that about &quot;TIHYDP kills me&quot; rants all those years ago? What a fucking hypocrite. Would be funny if Keemstar did a react to some of the greatest detractor content just to piss Phil of. Because we all know it would
Everything he&#39;s saying here applies to himself too. What a joke.

But seriously ohmwrecker is only trying call out the Vanoss crew because they didn&#39;t wanted to play with him anymore and then he gets mad at theme and try&#39;s to call theme out for no f*cking reason
Okay this might be a little fanboyish right now but H20 Delirious isn&#39;t a pedophile basicallyidowrk wanted the girl to show Delirious face and make him do a face reveal however the prank went wrong though plus Delirious didn&#39;t know that the girl was 17 if you don&#39;t know what age a girl is that doesn&#39;t make you a pedophile people are throwing H2O delirious under the same picture as mini Ladd however mini Ladd knew the girls ages where 16 and 17 but delirious didn&#39;t you can check the tweets and also quite defending ohm all he&#39;s trying to do is calling out the Vanoss crew because they didn&#39;t want to play with him anymore
I mean,  he&#39;s not wrong.  I don&#39;t know how many times I heard you mention how many views a video got and how nice you were to privatize it for wildcat in the span of 2 paragraphs in one video.  I get it though.  You want views so you tied yourself by getting that Ohm interview
Keemstar why do you side stupid ohmwrecker WHY WHY WHY
I know evan has nothing to do with this and shouldn’t be dragged into the title<br>But in my opinion<br>How else is he going to make a short title without “the vanoss crew“<br>But ofc keems— is still an a—-
Full thinking time. If what delirious says is true, he did something without asking her age and as a guy not face to face with someone and if they sound old enough or whatever, females do it to boys over the phone if they sound overly manly for example, you just can&#39;t tell and he got played. The same thing happened to others with worse outcomes but generally the innocent end up hurt in those types of situations. It&#39;s what the law mean call a very gray line. That&#39;s where people&#39;s opinions come in I guess? I just like discussing really. Again do not agree with young people mixing with old in this type of way, don&#39;t let that get lost in my messy translation.
keemstar has been a scumbag
what a no life video over an equally stupid youtuber , why are you all so interested in drama
Literally keems only weapon is- <br><br>YoUr OpInIoN iS iRelLaVeNt <br><br><b>angry gnome noises</b>
This one didn&#39;t age well
@TVJ legit wont give up on ohm lmao, only reason why he is popular, Ohm is a weird ass dude in the wrong let it go
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7YuBQXPW4&amp;t=6m15s"">6:15</a> that didn’t age so well now he’s “retiring”
wait a minute....<br><br>No one:<br>TJV: Ohh you do edit your videos. That&#39;s why your videos look like trash.<br><br>No one:...<br>TJV meanwhile editing his logo and voice and switching between the logo and screen recording
I stopped listening to anything Keem said after the fuck-shit he tried with Pyrocinical.
Keem star is like a Karen they both say thing that happened many years ago
OMG!!! He still looks like a f..king gnome
I&#39;ve lost interest in Ohmwrecker&#39;s content, a while before the drama, and I still had the decency to learn how to say his name.
Keemstars the bottom of the internet now😂😂
Idk how keem still on YouTube , gradeA made sum good points on why keem is never a reliable source to go to
Oh so that’s why he was Darkseid in Ohm vs Vanoss Crew, DC edition
I just watched keem his video just doesn’t hold much evidence it’s like he automatically sided with ohm not asking serious questions about what ohms been posting.
boxing match please
Tbh ngl most of your videos abt ohm is biased asf
F*cking mel going after keem...absolute legend
Dude keemstart is so irrelevant to the vanoss crew I&#39;m not even going to get into it
Oooof this was 🔥
Amazing vid but sorry to say you kinda look like him a bit 😭
There a reason why it&#39;s called drama alert all he wants to do is cause drama and keep it going so he has content
Bro someone get this man some thug life glasses
Ngl keem makes things worst tbh -_-
Did he delete them? I only see the one dramalert video
He acting like we’re stans. We ain’t fucking dream stans
&quot;I&#39;ll be here, collecting my checks... proving youre wrong&quot; The disrespect in that sentence 😭<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23krustykeemstar"">#KrustyKeemstar</a>
I just want to drag Keem by his dirty beard
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7YuBQXPW4&amp;t=11m52s"">11:52</a> omg i actually do XD
Keem wants drama to happen so I&#39;m pretty sure he didnt cut important info and before the whole DMs thing
Keemstar has ALWAYS been a douche. He should&#39;ve stayed banned from YouTube
I&#39;m confused how is delirious wrong???? Was he not tricked into talking to this said minor and he had no idea about her age, how is that his fault???? And what other stuff is out there supposedly??
Keem Has something inside his skull that is rotting since the day of his birth.
Keem is just a little rat who never does anything good smh 🤦‍♂️
Hahaha this shows soo much about Keem as well! Trying to act like the good guy but when getting exposed being the person he really is!! Says soo much but give proof as well dumb fuck
I watched a few of your videos already and I already unsubscribed from that joke show drama alert
Lol <br>Keemstar: Ohm prove that I cut information from the interview,I edit my own videos I cut out boring stuff maybe I cut out something important.<br>My brain:I&#39;m going to kill myself trying to understand this BS
I fucking despise that piece of shit KEEMSTAR, you&#39;ve gained a fan. How have I not found your channel SOONER??!?!
Ewww keemstar
I’ve never heard my dude TeeJai this pissed off.<br><br><br><br>(Edit: I just got to the point where TeeJai says “here’s the video”, and now a KFC add is playing.)
because he&#39;s Keemstar, &quot;I can do anything i want and I don&#39;t care&quot;
Just wait. Keem will be crying as soon as ohm backstabs him. <br>The entire crew has bad history. Everyone has done fucked up shit. Nobody is born pure. In short ohm and keem are hypocrites",PT17M43S,-0.9787

Honestly the n word shit and edgy stuff I couldnt care less about, but what he did to that kid was fucked up. I thought the joke was gonna be the giving of a kid a game he doesn&#39;t understand, but he legit did some evil shit.
Do another one there&#39;s plenty more now
the kid might be an actor but keem’s done way worse things in the past, i hope his channel dies
The fact that this was six years ago.... Wow.
These dudes super weird
man i hate keemstar
What a great parent keemstar is😂
lmao this is some funny shit right here. What were the worst moments?
a lot of this was fake or parody or completely justified in context
lol, he can&#39;t afford having his daughter involved in the same bullshit that he does to other kids, small pp behaviour :(
“fuck the fans” had me dying
Literally every clip is from a bit he did
That fucking bastard! Are you kidding me?! How can anyone support this piece of shit?! Poor kid. 😰
he&#39;s such a disgusting person honestly. i have zero respect for him.
I still remember when someone (I think their name was justine paradise?) said they got r*ped by one of the Paul brothers and they had a ton of evidence to prove it (including the snapchat location thing, a series of social media posts, etc). Keemstar directed a ton of hate towards her, saying that she was just looking for attention and that she should have just &quot;closed her mouth&quot; when the Paul brother grabbed her face and tried to put his thing in her mouth. Disgusting.
Keem is the type of kid in school where they gossip about every one but when someone talks $hit to them they run and snitch to a teacher
He&#39;s a sociopath
Keemstar takes the n word pass without asking
ive said it before and ill say it again. I COULD NOT LIVE WITH MYSELF IF I WAS KEEMSTAR
Man fred durst went downhill
coming back to this after that piece of shit retired. good riddance.
My effing ears were destroyed after this but it was still enjoyable
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGuMdNuSi04&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a> you know what I really hate children but what keemstar did to him was fucking bullshit
his entire channel
What a prick

Why is he still getting hate?

I knew he was bad for the pyro stuff but didn’t know he was pure evil
I hope the kid’s parents from the second clip saw the video and sued hid for 2 counts of assault. <br>1. Him grabbing the kid<br>2. Shoving the ice cream in his face
Questions in thw internet: if you have 1 billion dollars what will you use it for<br><br>Me:buy 1m ice creams and 200 x box and throw it at keem&#39;s house
Honestly Idc what anyone says YouTube wouldn’t be YouTube without keemstar he’s entertaining as shit

You and Def absolutely ended Shit Stirs career. He always reminds me of that slob at work who snitches on people to make himself look better. Shameful he spilled teen age tea that long. Rest in piss Shit Stir.

He&#39;s like so mad that he wasn&#39;t mentioned in enough videos so he had to search for his name on your page and then showed just those filtered results to fake an obsession 😂😂😂
this no stakes beef between karenstar and ethan is hilarious and thoroughly entertaining

Bruh just dont show your acount x) like of course peapole Will ad and messege him he is legit the biggest youtuber ever
The only dude on this platform that has that many subs and still acts like a normal person.
You can’t call us bros and then say we ain’t your friends. That was deep
ITS OVER!!!!
You know he wanted to drop that hard R sooooooooooooo bad. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why do people even watch him
in this video wee see a youtuber harassed by idot fans during the live stream and because he got angry people forgot he was an actual person so took it out of context, and a lot of people starting making videos on him because of all the potential clout
I know he probably gets that type of reaction 24/7 but why not just take a second to read some of the messages and reply back verbally. These people love him and have loved him for many years. Some people take shit like that very seriously so when they&#39;re telling him &quot;hey pewds been watching your channel for years!&quot; And he responds back with fuck you you ruin everything, then some people might really take that to heart. I know who cares right? But still I just believe as a content creator you should never forget where you came from and what made you to begin with.
Lemme fix your title<br>“Man child has a breakdown while his fans give him appreciation.”
Pewds L
Can&#39;t blame him at all
His fault for showing his user profile I guess? Even celebrities make mistakes, nobody’s perfect.
Boomer moment
That was the friendliest meltdown i seen 😅
no sympathy hes racist
Damn he&#39;s messed up
I mean being spammed like that looks annoying as fuck
I haven’t watched this yet, but the thought of Pewdiepie snapping at any point sounds more terrifying than any horror game he’s played.
It’s more he probably made them all feel stupid and “scolded” when it was probably just a few trolls.  Like they need to be reminded they are not on the great Pewdiepie’s level.  You MF’s who make these fake ass “cartoon characters” rich and famous are the first ones they trash when the stress of fame and fortune get to them……it’s just a pathetic weird relationship these people have with their “community”.  Who TF watches a grown man play video games and thinks to themselves…..I need to send this dude some of my money.   People are weird
Yeah we’re not friends…..just send me your god damn money and leave me alone….:so relatable
Why dox your self tho lol
&quot; Notice me Pew dew !! &quot;<br><br>Leave the dude alone
He knows hes an entertainer and not a virtual friend to his fans
It’s understandable getting mad but bro should’ve immediately made a new account the minute this one got leaked it’s just how it goes you give the wrong people an inch they’ll take a mile
wdym &quot;snapping&quot; bro got a little upset bc people were spamming him
You can tell the uploader is 13
i hope you guys realize that they are just actors on stream for money his gives zero fucks about you just your money that goes for every streamer in the world js
It was a misinput 😢
Yes that&#39;s obviously the issue. Yes they have no friends. Also, Felix, it&#39;s your fault for showing your account. This was so minor and you acted so cunty.
any gamer would hate that lol. you are so focus on the story and suddenly you get bombarded by 100+ group invitations
Simp<br>&quot;I BEEN WATCHIN YOU SINCE 2015&quot;<br><br>PEWD <br>&quot;i hate you!&quot;<br><br>i love it XD
Where is the part where he says the n word?
why he went from the 9 year old to the 19 year old army
It would have been kinda hilarious if everyone started sending: apology accepted😅
C’mon he’s clearly joking
Dude this is nothing. I would drop some profanity.
asshole reaction.<br><br>It always makes me laugh seeing the d*ckriders in comment sections sticking up for celebrities/streamers who &quot;just want their privacy&quot;.<br><br>Like uhh, you do realise the very nature of their income stream IS the public exposure, yeah?<br><br>lolol
Should have seen the Doc when his fans did this while he was playing gears of war
These people don’t know old pewds
oh no! A human being getting mad? Time to capture the moment.
Guys leave him alone .. you’re being so weird. Let the man play
People rlly be desperate
He&#39;s an asshole. He could&#39;ve just turned the notifications off without being a dick and insulting his own fanbase. Look at how YaBoyRoshi handled it while playing DDLC. He clearly got annoyed but turned the notifications off WITHOUT being a dick. The chat was more angry than him
He handled that like really well though
“If you’re the real pewdiepie I just wanted to say thanks”<br><br>I HATE YOU
Say the n word
People it&#39;s not about him being in the right or wrong. His apology was in good taste because even if he had the right to get angry, he shows he has empathy and can admit when he believes he was speaking in bad taste. You can be in the right and still go too far with your language. Him admitting this shows he is a good man.
That’s not cool 😂

Didn&#39;t Etika literally say Keem was going to be one of the reasons he killed himself?
Kyle just phases out of existence and we have to listen to Woody
Etika’s own fans dogged on him, poked fun. Then everyone changed their tune when he died.
Mental health NEEDS to be treated better and talked about more
Woody with those luke warm takes. What chode.
Don&#39;t disagree with keems analysis on mental health, it is just mental weakness, some can cure it by achieving and filling voids in your life and some can&#39;t cure it all all, but it is weakness if ya like it or not. That being said you shouldn&#39;t bully those people, just let them live in their house an dont bother with them.
Who knows?
Probably not

Cowards  keep going after Woody family
You know Woody is a Aryan Brotherhood thing.
Keemstar is cringe personified.  He&#39;s like the annoying person who somehow shows up at a house party you threw even though no one invited him and they don&#39;t want him there and he&#39;s also done a lot of cocaine so you&#39;re like well fuck maybe I&#39;ll at least he&#39;ll throw me a bump or two but of course he&#39;s got shit coke and also he&#39;s now drinking beers out your fridge and none of them belong to him and now you&#39;re like &quot;okay dude time to go&quot; but he&#39;s fueled full of shit coke and stolen beer and tries to fight you but you don&#39;t actually wanna fight or kill the vibe so you just have a bunch of dudes team up on him and shove him back in his car but then he comes back in and he&#39;s on even more shit coke and then you gotta repeat the entire process and then-
I didn&#39;t know Keem went after his kid. Pretty fucked up tbh
wife beater? never heard of that, can someone explain?
Keemstars 20 year old girlfriend realized how big a spunk barrel he was and dumped him. The fame was clearly not worth being around someone so obnoxious and his life seems to be pretty miserable right now. Couldnt think of a bigger dickhead for this to happen to
You gotta add a “that’s what’s up” counter
Someone needs to make a compilation of all the sexist shit Keem has said.
He has better reasons than me, I just think Keems a massive douchebag
Keemstar has a kid that alone shows you how great of a role model he is . Starting drama and sniffing it out like no other he loves seeing people hurt or mad .Dude is damn rich af an still act like that man i swear you gotta be a shit face to have anything
Wait who likes keemstar? Oh yea only 12 year olds who loves faze clan morals
Sad thing is Woody and Keem used to be friends a long time ago before Keem became the person he is today.
I think everyone hates queifstar these days..lol he&#39;s ruined..
so, that&#39;s what&#39;s up
Keem is just the TMZ of YouTube
Even while talking about how much he hates him, Woody was still trying to be fair and honest. Respect.
Yeah he probably really doesn&#39;t make any original content he just magnifies other people&#39;s lives
If you look up the word tool in the dictionary
If Keemstar cucked Ethan Klein he gets props for the community service
I don’t like either one but Dr Disrespect is a character and Keemstar is not a character.
Wife beater? If that’s a fact, you could have stopped there….f*** him.
Mucho respect for Woody shitting on the gnome.
Heh. I didn&#39;t do homework because they couldn&#39;t punish someone living in hell. Jokes on them. I found freedom.
Keem admits he’s a villain and that’s why I love him
Keemstar undeservedly has ruined so many people’s lives and done so much totally unacceptable behavior that it’s ok to not forgive him. I just can’t believe people defend him despite the fact that someone who plays that character and doesn’t see anything wrong with it, is likely just as shitty as the character they play; is beyond me. It’s like women who love Chris brown despite the fact he’s a known POS. It just doesn’t make sense to defend someone like that. Even if jake Paul is a character you wouldn’t defend him and yet all these people defend Keem Star for no reason.
Mathew Woodworth VS Daniel Keem <br>Boxing match 2022. <br>Winner gets to put Chiz out of his pretentious misery by way of forcefeeding till death.
Only thing you can give keen is having the best news show on the platform! Wasn’t for him i wouldn’t know what’s going on here. Not the best dude tho lmao
People like keemstar are a scourge on society profiting off of others failures and mistakes.... We don&#39;t need people like him and we wont miss them when they disappear.
People needed an explanation??? Lmfao
I find it weird Keemstar does not report on the messed up things OnlyUseMeBlade did.
Woody I swear your such a Karen sometimes....
I bet this dude likes H3H3. lol
Keemstar is a textbook villain and thats why he&#39;s hilarious
Yeah, fuck that guy. He hides behind his persona when the heat gets too hot.
I hate the way Keemstar acts but at the end of the day, thats why I love him",PT5M6S,-0.9729

Imagine being on the internet and not knowing that the end of frenemies was completely Trisha’s fault, yikes
This guy is so lame I can’t watch
I love that kareem tries to keep bri involved , I always get upset when she asks them questions but doesn’t answer them herself, I like that he keeps her involved and gets her to answer them since the guys don’t ask her
Crying laughing at this camp rock commentary
KSI is really big in music right now probably more so currently than lil Wayne, at least in the UK
Wtf was w go Demarcus??? That shit was outa left field
Bro imagine getting asked that question. You can the shock on her face. Like did they really just ask me this. I would panic as well, like what the hell.
I’m telling Y’all wait for it there will be a surviving Dave I’ll guarantee it. Dave can’t get women his age anyway sorry Dave is a mess he knows these girls want that life lol of fucking himeans they get the money let’s go lol gross
“I’m a big fan of Demi’s, I think”. This line was gold
they def dont know how ksis career is like
Keemstar has a lil crush on Bryce hall or that’s who his boxing company signed, he was way too defensive when dave said his loss was too bad to come back from. calling it now
The Charli vs Khaby Lame race is just<br> like t-series vs pewdiepie
Bri brings relatability that’s why she’s my favorite part &lt;3
bri carries this pod
Love H3!!
Just so you know ksi music does insanely well in uk
THE ROMAN AD ROLL LMAOOO
I love keemstar idc. It’s like a guilty pleasure lol.
KSI is a lot bigger then what you guys think
bring one of the Jenner&#39;s or Kardashian&#39;s
The quickness of going through the topics is genius... awesome format
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX_fvArPYnk&amp;t=15m38s"">15:38</a> lol 😂 I am crying ! I love how mad he gets
These dumb fs don&#39;t even know ksi&#39;s music is literally blowing up
Keemstar has that Peter Pan syndrome, but he looks and acts like a bi-curious Captain Hook.
keem is so obsessed with ethan it’s embarrassing.
The BFF’s sign should FT Brianna LaPaglia
Ariana Grande is a mean girl. A close family friend I know worked in her green room back in 2018 and Ariana asked for “room temperature water”. When she got the water she spit it out onto the floor and said “this isn’t room temperature” and told her “Do you know what room temperature is because clearly not.” She also said the veggies weren’t cold enough. She’s just nasty.
I always thought by now Tik Tok was for most people. ... But then thetees Dave upset about it lmzo
Old Portnoy is racist for doubting Ariana Grande&#39;s nationality.
Can someone tell Portnoy how to say Fousey, D&#39;Amelio
I love bri lol
Ethan 100% did not * ruin frenemies . That’s bullshit.
The h3 podcast is one of the biggest podcasts in the world do your research
keep up the great pods! 💙
❤️❤️❤️
love you josh! 🤍
the way Dave is so unbelievably wrong about Ethan being successful 😂😂 Foot soldiers assemble
Watching this and a news thing popped up telling me Afghanistan fell to the Taliban really makes me wonder what is going on in life.
I hope this podcast never ends I never know what’s going on and you guess tell me everything!!
Omgggg. . Keemstar is only defending Tricia so they can gang up on Ethan.  Tricia was a horrible person on Frenemies,  she treated Ethan horribly,  and it was a hundred percent her fault she off of it.  Such a disgusting display of ganging up on someone because you are so jealous of Ehan Klein.  Tricia is a narcissist, pathological liar and anyone who defends her must be equally F up.
The disrespect on KSIs name is insane.
Damn Dave could you be a little more excited for the episode to be over? lmao 😂
bruh keemstar forsure has a fake beard &amp; mustache
Ew I was actually into this podcast but putting this guy on is disgusting. Keem is trash
Imagine saying Ethan couldn’t be successful with his podcast When BEFORE frenemies he was doing almost just as well for years
“go bills” love the hometown love but they went to the super bowl 4x, choked everytime lol
Ay keemstar this podcast flipped
I heard this podcast is run by Ryan kvaughn. Who allegedly runs a Ponzi scheme, which his BFF keemstar accused him of. One star podcast. With peace and love, the foot soldiers.
I love the show guys, but holy shit it’s getting repetitive every time but fuck. I understand you have to plug certain shit but every show your talking about shut that happened forever ago and it’s every show now days.. but I’ll keep listening for meow…!",PT1H1M21S,0.9768

Similar edgy creators like FilthyFrank have made similar jokes and censorship leads to a slippery slope. Besides, Leafy only 1 warning and 0 strikes prior to his YouTube ban. Youtube didn’t even give him 3 strikes in the span of 30 days, they skipped all 3 strikes at once and banned him.
&quot;edgy humor&quot; isn&#39;t what I consider dark humor dark humor can have a but of the joke but you usually want to leave the joke without anyone&#39;s name despite dark humor being about dark subjects sometimes I usually try to create a scenario that hasn&#39;t happened to anyone I know irl or anyone I know at all sometimes with my friends if I know that they&#39;re ok with me joking about something that happened in their past I&#39;ll throw a one off comment about it you don&#39;t need to be a a*shole to do dark humor btw I started this comment when you started to describe dark humor and ended when you  finished saying not all dark humor is bad
Can we collectively stop misusing the phrase &quot;death threat?&quot;<br><br>Telling someone to kill themselves, while completely inappropriate, isn&#39;t <i>even</i> a threat. Telling someone you want to kill them <i>is</i> a death threat. Telling someone you wish they had died isn&#39;t <i>even</i> a threat.
I think this especially applies to n-word jokes. I&#39;ve used the n word myself in a few jokes to make fun of police brutality.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen usage of the N-bomb skyrocket since Musk took over Twitter. Those do NOT sound like jokes to me.
“I was not a cool kid” Well looking at your career status on YouTube, you are now.
Most of dark humor nowadays is just bullying in disguise.
IDubbz ended their careers 5 years ago, and that people who are defending them are nothing more than just simps and tools.
Lots of people today tend to misuse dark/edgy humor and make it really annoying.
While I get where you&#39;re coming from, I have to disagree with your point about deplatforming. The point of deplatforming isn&#39;t to change the minds of the person being deplatformed, it&#39;s to stop them from doing more harm to people and spreading harmful rhetoric. Sure, leafy being deplatformed didn&#39;t change his mind at all, but leafy no longer being on youtube means that there&#39;s one less avenue for people to find his content and be influenced by it, and one less place for leafy to cause harm to other people. THAT&#39;S what deplatforming is about, whether or not it changed his mind about anything doesn&#39;t matter.
The old show mash is like an amazing example of dark humor, the whole thing is about doctors in the Korean war trying to stay sane. It would been so easy for them to make a bunch of racist or offensive humor about the Koreans living there at the time (and to be frank the show is from the 70s so the representation of Korean people isn&#39;t perfect) but instead the show treats them as fellow victims of the war. All the jokes are usually at the expense of the higher ups and governments forcing people to fight and survive a pointless war. The show succeeded because they were consistently punching up and criticizing those with power, not punching down towards the victims of the war. That&#39;s where these edgy YouTubers fail, punching down towards those weaker then you is just bullying, dark humor is about joking about your own circumstances or criticizing the absurdity of those in power
as someone who WAS a fan of leafy, i am extremely grateful my very young self got the hell out of there and got out of the “edgy humor” mindset.
Like niggah brandenburg test, before you make a video explaining why it&#39;s not comedy at least include this
I have the simple idea of get this.<br>Not taking things these people on the internet say seriously.<br>What are these 400lb mfs gonna do to you?
My main humour is dark humour, and it&#39;s so annoying that &quot;edgy humour&quot; that&#39;s just being an ass is seen as dark humour.
Wait until this guy finds out about speed 😭
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2r39-f1gWI&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a> Actually there were only three videos he made on her. Rest of them he never mentioned anything related to her... Also calling her a bitch and stuff... He never did that 🤨
Dark humour is the way people deal with their trauma and struggles. It&#39;s not throwing punches at marginalised groups, minorities, peoples. It&#39;s not kicking someone when they&#39;re down. The difference is huge and easy to spot to those of us that understand social cues.<br><br>Like, adding &quot;lol&quot; at the end of your bigoted rant doesn&#39;t make it comedy. It makes it a bigoted rant by a bigot that tries to minimalize their bigotry and get away with it. While you might have the freedom of speech, you don&#39;t have a right to a platform or a right to an audience. So kick them to the curb asap and show that their bigotry isn&#39;t appreciated. Those following them then have to accept the reality that the rest of us aren&#39;t interested in their garbage views. If they decide to continue their cesspools of inadequacy on other platforms, a) those platforms should also kick them to the curb and b) the kids watching that don&#39;t necessarily understand that difference yet will have to actively make accounts somewhere else to follow these clowns. So it WILL stop their sick influence on the kids at least somewhat, as opposed to just ignoring the problem and expecting it to go away on it&#39;s own. Silence can be just as bad as bad actions. We should not ignore their garbage words, we should be loudly and clearly telling them exactly how wrong they are. They want to be &#39;edgy&#39;? Well, edgy means you have to swim against the current. I&#39;ll be the fucking current in the way of homophobic, transphobic, racist, classist, misogynistic assholes all day every day. Fuck these garbage people and their garbage spewing.
Can we please stop letting these scumbags get away vile behavior by calling it “edgy humor” I don’t believe in deplatforming but they should absolutely be demonetized. You have to starve these cretins out. Canceling just gives the ability to play the victim and capitalize off that.
Any edgy humor except kys and death threats is funny.<br><br>I laugh at fatherless jokes because they&#39;re funny af and do expose how flawed society is.<br><br>Kys? Hell no, not in my books.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2r39-f1gWI&amp;t=6m09s"">6:09</a> they deserve each other, perfect couple
I love edgy and dark humor. But the jokes I like are jokes that very hyperbolically shows what is wrong with societal issues.<br>The way Keemstar, Leafy, and others of those knuckleheads potray themselves as people who use edgy humor when it is just throwing insults is just both laughable and sad at the same time.
Keemstar is a preteen bully in an adult&#39;s body and it would be embarrassing if I didn&#39;t know for a fact that he can and has hurt people.
I feel so lucky that I never got into Leafy. I watched a couple of his videos when I was in my 2016-antisjw-feminist-owned phase. What saved me is that his videos were boring as hell.
I love your content, been binging it, but I disagree on your opinion of deplatforming on the basic that it won&#39;t change their mind. I think the point is more to protect the spread of their dangerous behaviors and rhetoric.
Leafy bringing a gun to a protest hoping to use it is a real Kyle move
edgy humor is stupid generally, but saying &#39;kill yourself&#39; isn&#39;t humor, nor is it edgy. It&#39;s just dangerous and horrible, and anyone giving death threats to others is an idiot and a dangerous person.
OMG 😳. Am I the only one who’s eyes went wide when that thing with the gun and the BLM protests was mentioned….besides the person he was talking to, I mean.
I’ve never heard of these people and I think that I’m all the better for it. I’ll be on the lookout to not engage with their content from now on.
Wait! People don’t like being made fun of?!? Holy cow…I’d say that’s why I don’t have any friends but I think there are a lot of other things going on with me!!
&quot;People usually don&#39;t like you when you make fun of them&quot; this dude has clearly never been to Britain
God, I can&#39;t believe back in 9th grade I used to find Leafy as funny and the one in the right. That was 6 years ago and I&#39;m ashamed that I ever enjoyed his content. Thanks for adding to this discussion, it was very well made
It&#39;s horrible to be edgy now days,  cause everyone would think I&#39;m like those imbeciles.  Im edgy but I have notion of humanity and limits. I do my best to be in the grey line of edgy humor were nobody is harmed by it
I think it goes far beyond edgy humor... thats a generous (and rather disingenuous) way of approaching it. they&#39;re dangerous and harmful people
Keemstar and Leafy are the perfect example of Dark Humor that doesn&#39;t work. I think that dark humor can be funny when it isn&#39;t about insulting persons
that&#39;s cool and all but, fuck keemstar <b>lmao</b>
My friend uses targeted jokes towards either me or one of my other friends, hate him for it sm.
in my opinion, it&#39;s ok to make &quot;edgy&quot; jokes, IF it&#39;s something based around you, if it&#39;s at a group of people and using crutches such as racism, sexism, etc. it&#39;s just bullying. also if the joke is at a certain person it ok but only if you know the person, and know that their ok with it
the best dark humor is based on your own experiences and not pointing and laughing at something you don&#39;t understand that&#39;s the difference between someone calling me a dyke and me calling myself a dyke for a joke, edgy humor however is never based on your own experience, there isn&#39;t usually a punchline it&#39;s just the pointing and laughing, the 21st century version of pillory, people don&#39;t find it funny because it&#39;s a joke, they&#39;re laughing because it makes them feel better about themself
The thing is that actual dark humour gets grouped with jokes that are actually offensive and altogether, gets a bad name. There are certain situations where you can use dark humour and internet is not a place for it. You don&#39;t know who the person reading your shitpost joke is or what they&#39;ve gone through. Dark humour is okay amongst friends who have a mutual understanding in the sense that they both are okay with it. Everyone has their own sense of humour and obviously, that&#39;s okay. People don&#39;t respect that. Not a lot of people are into really dark jokes and that&#39;s okay, it actually means they&#39;re mentally healthier than the ones cracking these jokes. That&#39;s all.
People these days will literally say a hate crime or expose their own bigotry online. Then the moment you call them out they claim it&#39;s all &quot;edgy humor&quot; and they cant be held responsible for it and that you&#39;re taking it too seriously if you try to.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2r39-f1gWI&amp;t=3m04s"">3:04</a> this entire section is so fucking GOOD. because, YEAH. I was one of those kids. I&#39;m so glad I grew out of it relatively quickly, but I was still one of those kids.
Deplatforming works, kids 👍
Leafy&#39;s still here?
How does one go to a protest and wants something to go wrong to shoot someone…… like how? Even if this was a joke, he didnt seem like he was joking and why would you joke about that
I believe that there&#39;s a good way and a bad way to make edgy humor. <br><br>The good way is if the joke has a setup and a half-decent punchline. If it&#39;s a racist joke, it&#39;s generally made as a way to mock these beliefs. South Park and Family Guy, for example, have been doing racist jokes since their inceptions, but their creators have said it&#39;s more or less a way to poke fun at racists by using humor like that. Besides, their jokes have a set-up and punchline. <br><br>The bad way is when the racism IS the punchline, and the guy decides whether it was a joke or not, based on the reactions of the people around him. If the people laugh, then he says, &quot;I know, funny, right?!&quot;, but if nobody laughs, he says, &quot;Jeezus, it&#39;s just a joke! God, people are such snowflakes these days...&quot;
A very long time ago I threatened a woman that lived across the street from me. I did it out of anger, several people in the neighborhood witnessed it. No one thought it was a legitimate threat. About 10-15mns after that incident my bf pulled up and I left for work as him coming had been the plan since the previous day AND was the reason I was outside. After I left that woman came outside with her gun and told my mom if I ever try anything, she’s gonna kill me. Several people witnessed that. My mom told her that she’s acting ridiculous and it was obvious to everyone that I made an empty threat. An hour later the police are knocking on my mom’s door bc the neighbor called the police. My mom told them what happened then called me. The police asked my side, I told them and the police were like, “uh....” <br>The police spoke to people that had been outside then left. Neighbor was pissed that I wasn’t in any kind of trouble so she decided to tell as many people as possible and pretend to be afraid of me, including all the people at the church but unfortunately too many people saw her come outside with her gun.  No one thought she was afraid of me and everyone knew I said something mean outta of anger and although I was wrong to say it, they all knew I didn’t mean it and thought she was in the wrong for trying to get me arrested and trying to get the neighborhood and church folk not to like me. So that blew up in her face and everyone basically treated her the way she was hoping everyone would treat me.<br><br>Wow, bitch! That was long. What’s your fucking point?<br>People will often say stupid shit that they don’t mean that may hurt someone. When that happens, instead of doubling down, sincerely apologize then keep it moving.<br><br>That old hag and I both did wrong. I apologized she didn’t. Everyone forgave me and not her. Most people know no one is perfect and are willing to forgive if you’re truly apologetic and don’t keep doing the same shit over and over.<br><br>Keemstar and Leafy remind me of the old lady. She also did something
ik this is an older vid but when Leafy came back I went to his comment sections and they were just FULL of fanboys praising him. They make fun of leftists and ‘sjws’ for being ‘sheep’ but these guys fucking turned on Leafy when the content cop came out on him and called him cringe. Yet completely turned back to praise him when he came back as if he had changed.
The thing that bothered me about leafys sudden ban from YouTube (sudden in the sense that it happened all at once) is that YouTube looked like they were specifically watching him and waiting for him to eff up. That’s fine, but then they sit and protect other, more problematic creators that manipulate children and also allowing scams to be advertised to their website. So like, did leafy deserve to be banned? Maybe. But there’s so much more that needs to be done and youtube doesn’t care at all. It just looks like someone had a vendetta against him and doesn’t actually care about protecting the platform and it’s disingenuous for them to act like they care when they clearly don’t.
My ex had “edgy” humor which was just transphobic and homophobic. He broke up with me for being bi and non-binary after using me as a joke for a month :)
My rule of thumb for dark humor is it can be punching up or even out, but never down. I make jokes about homophobia (I’m queer), jokes about how mentally ill I am (I’ve been diagnosed), and jokes about white people, rich people, etc. I do NOT make jokes about racial minorities, people with different mental health conditions than I do, or ANYTHING targeted at a person unless I know for sure the person will react well. Punching up or out is funny because you’re bringing light to something that sucks in a way that demonizes the thing that makes it so sucky. Punching down just reinforces oppression cycles and makes people feel majorly shitty",PT15M9S,-0.9966

You single-handedly drove out most of the commentary channels llmfaooo
You will be missed keem take care bud!
Wish this would have been true. So sad to see people lie to us like this.

🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Woooooo
WOW, THIS IS FANTASTIC
I think you should’ve retired considering you’re not really relevant anymore. Why do dead channels still upload? More people still shop at Kmart than watch your videos.
Love him or hate him, He is one of the great youtubers 👍.
This is a big W
You won&#39;t find a person who is as evil as you
I also miss the good old days of youtube where disstracks came left and right
Finally
LETS GO
Damn some retirement hes got going on right now.
yay I hate this mf
OMG FINALLY JESUS
13 years of terrorising this platform. Get off it
Surprised he didn’t quit after he basically was one of the reason edika ended up taking his own life i hope he still lives with that quilt knowing he was bashing a mentally ill person to death
This guy did not fucking quit
its so funny to me to look and go thru the comments, only to find that its just a bunch of cry babies repeating each other&#39;s sad songs of &quot;so glad he&#39;s gone, blah blah bitch, piss and moan, boo hoo&quot; like this same people be right back here for the next video, and the next one and so on. Someone said Keem is a &quot;clout chaser&quot; ill not mention how stupid of a remark that is considering the same ones pointing and calling name are just as bad if not worse than the thing they chastise. You&#39;re not clout chasing by posting lame, unoriginal, regurgitated comments, each one getting more and more absurd as to draw the attention of others? Everyone loves bad news PERIOD its a sad fact but its true. If the news, any news platform or news station main stream only put out good news, it&#39;d fail and no one would watch. For whatever reason, this new era is a cesspool breeding ground for over sensitive, original opinion lacking, im gonna yell louder than you talk bcuz I have nothing intelligent to say cry babies. Keem is good at what he does, and I urge any of you to step foot into even an hour of what its like to do what he does and dont succumb to the pressures and pitfalls of a job like this. Oh but wait, that wont happen bcuz the last generation of real thinkers, I handle my own, dont hided behind a keyboard my thoughts are all mine, was mid to late 80&#39;s babies(and some very early 90s but not many.) The ones after, need a safe space to hide in when they spout the incessant bullsh*t someone else said. You cant talk shit about someone and then sub to their channel and watch every video they have, and keep doing so while talking shit, if you do you&#39;re a hypocrite and prove every one of my points.<br><del>-thanks for coming to my Grow the F*&amp;$ up talk-</del>
Cancel culture ruined everything! 👎🗑
Why people hate keem so much? I really don&#39;t care what he&#39;s done. I just watch because seeing all the drama is entertaining.
what good news! he&#39;s still here. wahoo.
It&#39;s been 6 months and you still haven&#39;t found a replacement
As expected, you never retired you freaking liar! But what can we expect from a person that lies in his news for views?
Sad part is you think we care
finally
Oh no! ..anyway.....
You never retired though, leach.
actually I want to see u in streets bro, good luck
get tf outa here
Good riddance.
Good, hope you retire from consuming oxygen too.
good loser byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Very good news,Hope it stays like this FOREVER
5 months later and he still here. 🤣
I don&#39;t care, like this if you also don&#39;t give a shit.
Good
Now stay retired for now…
You looked so much more like a BOSS, with NO facial hair.. Man, I thought you were kool af during the Wings, Woody, Elpresador drama, .. Now, nothing quite separates you with that broom hanging off your face, &quot;Cone&quot;, Sorry, Cone hanging off your face.
finally
Love him or hate him, he’s responsible for some great memes…
Good riddance, Thanks for spreading so much fake news about youtubers who did nothing wrong
VICTORY
Oh thank fuck he really is gone finally
Rip Bashur! X

Kinda surprised this is a transgender actually, personally thought this was an actual woman just pretending to be trans god this shit is getting a little more confusing nowadays 🗿

I love it how you demolished him so much that his only recourse was to literally do transphobic &quot;jokes&quot; literally bottom of the pile.
that whole thread was basically a contest of who can outpetty who

Keemstar roasted the shit out of you and I literally hate Keemstar....
A mind built perfectly to post. A queen.
This could just be funny. If it was in good fun, saying insane shit to Keffals and having her blast you back in public could be really funny content. This was all edgy ribbing until his feelings got hurt, why?
So like uhh who’s letting Keffals hit it raw?
