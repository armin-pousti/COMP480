Speaking Softly and Carrying a Big Stick | Mike Pence | EP 368,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and former Vice President Mike Pence discuss his current run for the 2024 presidency, the U.S. Government's overreach in economic matters when it should be playing referee, the indoctrination and sexualization of our youngest citizens, the realistic way forward on the Russia Ukraine front, and how we might finally stabilize a nation wrought with cultural warfare. 

Mike Pence, an American politician and native Hoosier, served as the 48th vice president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He previously served as the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017, and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. Before this he practiced private law, led the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, and hosted ‚ÄúThe Mike Pence Show,‚Äù a syndicated talk radio show that also aired as a public affairs program on TV once a week. He only recently announced his candidacy for President of the United States, and is currently on the campaign trail.

#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus",345953,9531,8413,2023-06-19T15:00:41Z,"I want to summarize this important point. Peterson asked essentially: what do you say to the notion that a weakened Russia is a dangerous one? Pence‚Äôs response was essentially: We clarify that our intention is to repel the Ukrainian invasion, and not take Russian land.  <br><br>I think that‚Äôs a very good response: to decouple the notion of our having a strong response, from the idea of backing Russia into a corner. The two don‚Äôt have to be stuck together like that: we simply articulate our policy clearly enough to distinguish between enforcing boundaries, and degrading the one who would transgress those boundaries.
He wiggles too much. Who needs an earpiece to have an authentic &amp; honest conversation? ü§î I know! A puppet.
My first impression of this guy Mike &quot;Pence&quot; = his mannerisms and bouncy head bobs remind me of the Bushes. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What can I say? &quot;TOTAL PUPPET&quot; . Sorry Jordan.. are you playing a ring master in the circus of the &#39;New World&#39; order? Hope not. Only a minute in üòÇ
As a non American and outsider from Europe I would trust both Mike Pence  and  DeSantis in daily life as neighbours or business associates and as leaders as well  but not the former one. It‚Äôs funny how Dr. J. Peterson perceives Mike Pence as a trustworthy person but people in the comments know better who is to be trusted without having a Phd in psychology. And  they want JP to interview the chief of lies that embarrassed himself at the last interview . Lol
He would totally support military industrial complex and corruption throughout Wall Street and big banks. He is trying to appeal to the 1980&#39;s republican. America needs a lot less pence. This guy is running to line his pockets not fix our problems. Can&#39;t wait to see Trump steam roll this weak SOB
People are dismissing Pence like they&#39;ve achieved something with lowly lives. What do you know? It seems most of you want to live  in a perfect utopia.<br><br>Man, I&#39;m not even an American, but this is how an American president should sound like. America needs a president who has the fear of God in him.
Pence is in bed with Military Industrial Complex
Trump interview next??
Sellout.
Pence speaks like a warmonger...another member of the uniparty in Washington DC
We know the truth to each of his heartfelt lies.<br><br>Thank you JBP for letting US witness this
Disgusting war/geopolitics
An official liar‚Ä¶. GET OUT!!!
BS Warhawk
This is dreadfully boring. going to the next one
Amazing how neither the left nor right likes Pence.
I wish he would ask when the &quot;right&quot; goes too far?
Now we know who blew up the pipeline?
Beware of soft speakers!! Most of the serial killers are soft spoken but then You on the other hand &#39;loud mouth Peterson&#39; did say he carries a big stick. Is that the talking stick or the fire stick?<br><br>Both fraudulent boastful skull and bones boys
Ummmm dude is a neo-con war monger
Kennedy was better.
snore
He lost me at the Russia/Ukraine part.
he was a VP and is stammering and halting as he talks in prepared remarks ?
You know the difference cause you to are a war criminal, don&#39;t let him fool you he was for the disgusting Iraq war
He‚Äôs an Epstein Islanderüëπ
This made me realize I would vote Mike Pence over Trump. If Trump wins, so be it. That&#39;s when I&#39;ll vote trump.
He thinks the country in trouble, REALLY it&#39;s because he didn&#39;t have the backbone to stand up to the rigged election when he had the opportunity, have zero respect for PENCE!
Peterson for president.
Pence is a SNAKE!  Would never support him EVER!!
No push back on us funding and pushing toward nuclear war at the detriment of our economy and citizens, come on Jordan
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNSg5TlwB6k&amp;t=28m06s"">28:06</a> did Pence just say WE took out Nordstream 2?
Pence; another Bible thumper neocon war monger with no time limit on Ukraine ...enough said..üôÑ
I have no confidence in American government toward Russia.<br>Putin was willing to end the war.<br>Pence is shameless and he is responsible for the amount of Ukraine men lost in this war.
Sounds like just another comic book super crook
Some president in the past said walk softly and carry <br>A big stick
That guy is a traitor. Still love you Jordan!‚ù§
Just think pence could have been president in a short 2 years if he didn&#39;t betray the POTUS. Now he wants to try to run for president are you kidding??????
Trump next? Please??
Sorry, but Pence just seems dumb
You can&#39;t win without trump supporters. You lie about upholding constitution.  You literally violated your duty to allow time to look at very questionable election results in 4 states. You could constitutionally but saw your chance to join the republican establishment and be a career man.
I thought Jordan Peterson was supposed to be a critical thinker. Mike Pence is a religious right neocon who was a Trump, yes man. I thought Jordan was a deep thinker who can see through the BS flotsam and jetsam which pollutes the low water line. Any politician who takes Citizens United bribe money is a sociopath at best and void of rectitude,  etc. period.
Great talk and I am very impressed by Vice President Pence. He would be a good choice
Necon did he really say that Nato expansion is just a bluff
Fly the pride !
Next Pompeo
Zzzzzzzzzz!!!
I can&#39;t listen to this guy.  It&#39;s like swallowing bees.  Talk about not knowing what time it is.",PT1H4M10S
You Might Already Be A Member | James Lindsay | EP 367,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. James Lindsay break down how Marxism evolved from a singular ideology into a genus, spawning many oppressor/oppressed dogmas across modern culture such as equity, critical race theory, and queer theory. They trace these sub-Marxist doctrines back past fundamental narrative into the theological realm, and detail their utility in the acquisition of power. Dr. Peterson and Dr. Lindsay also discuss the Grievance Studies Affair, of which Dr. Lindsay was a co-author and which casts a spotlight on the Marxist capture of our academic and scientific institutions.

An author, mathematician, and political commentator, Dr. James Lindsay has written eight books spanning a range of subjects including education, postmodern theory, and critical race theory. Dr. Lindsay is the founder of New Discourses, an organization dedicated to shining the light of objective truth in subjective darkness. Dr. Lindsay is the co-author of ‚ÄúCynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity‚Äïand Why This Harms Everybody‚Äù and the author of ‚ÄúRace Marxism,‚Äù as well as, ‚ÄúThe Marxification of Education.‚Äù Dr. Lindsay has been a featured guest on Fox News, Glenn Beck, Joe Rogan, and NPR, and he has spoken at the Oxford Union and the EU Parliament.

I bet you that if you timed how long Lindsay spoke and how long Jordon spoke the ratio would be significantly in Jordan&#39;s favour.  This is a 1 hour and 50 minute video.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Lindsay spoke less than 30 minutes of that.  This isn&#39;t to put Jordon down.  There are plenty of things he said that were interesting but I really wanted this to be a proper discussion where they break things down and get to the cores using their mental capabilities.
Dr. Peterson, to your point concerning men needing to adapt to women.¬†<br>The fact is that the media / state / psychology complex are realizing men all around the world, have left the dating / marriage / relationship market and now these same institutions are in a panic. This is why you see these sort of pleadings to men. They say ‚ÄúPlease come to the relationship market !!‚Äù.¬†<br>Women, purple haired Karen or not, need you they say, so adapt dammit!!  The question that should be asked of men or society at large is, WHY men should  &quot;adapt to women, the world needs you!‚Äù   <br>Adapt for or to, what?<br> -extraction of men‚Äôs resources? <br>-abuse of men‚Äôs propensity to protect and serve society?<br>-abuse of men in the divorce / custody industry?<br> -children? üòÇ <br> I could go on and on, however I‚Äôll leave you with this.  <br><br>Men have immense power in their ability to not care. ¬†<br>To not care what women or a woman wants. ¬†<br>To not care what society wants. ¬†<br>To not care what government wants. ¬†<br>To not care what the world wants. ¬†<br><br>This incredible power is manifest in the stoic man‚Äôs capacity to walk away.  Walk away from a world gone mad, and sit back on the porch to watch it burn to ashes from its own vanity. This is power and men should use it.  It‚Äôs belongs to men because being born a man means it is your responsibility to understand the world as it is, not as it is imagined by desperate people / institutions where their very existence relies on the sustenance of your ability and your effort.
Everyone is going to live in a VR world in the simulation we are already in.
Great interview!
The political left is anti-Christ. From &quot;male and female created He them&quot; to &quot;children obey your parents&quot; to &quot;go and sin no more&quot; the left is explicit in it&#39;s complete rejection of Judeo-Christian morals and values.
TikHistory talked about Gnosticism and its influence on Hilter and his National Socialism. Very fascinating, indeed!
This is a great discussion, but I think the clickbait title and thumbnail are suboptimal... You should consider a more nuanced hook for people, rather than just exaggeration and fear mongering.
Why don&#39;t you ever address who was the most overrepresented ethnic group in the Bolshevik revolution and Lenin/Stalin regimes, Juden Peterstein?
&quot;Parody of the darkest form&quot; sounds like &quot;perversion&quot; to me.
I couldn&#39;t stop listening to this. He leaves no room for error. Really amazing stuff
Who ever is a Marxist is a satanic and they don‚Äôt realize it. Marx was a Satan believer who rejected the True God at college age.
I&#39;m a socialist and I love critical thinkers. In Scandinavia we don&#39;t have only functionally socialism but we are also capitalists. It&#39;s an agreement. We meet in the center.
&quot;Polytheistic paganism&quot; is somehow the depths of hell? Because they aren&#39;t worshipping the demon Yahweh? Ok, Juden Peterstein. Pathetic.
Ironically, it&#39;s the use of the intellect out of boredom...  a game that religious and anti-religion intellectual have been playing and causing chaos--throwing the flock out of balance--and causing real harm for ever. Religious laws and details apart, the reason Marxism and Islamism are in a strange romance of convenience,  a boomerang based on some mystical, romanticist, anti-emancipation notions that are, basically, anti-Judo-Christian culture more than anything else. Wow, massage therapy,  a noble profession, the very core of all healing arts that is under-appreciated, under-compensated and exploited by the sex industry and more recently, by bored, new-agist academics with off-the-wall bodymind theories and &quot;new-improved&quot; theories techniques, or by bored Medical pros who turn massage from money making therapists into paying students..
Peterson acted like he‚Äôs interested in Lindsay‚Äôs answers but he‚Äôs not and consistently ties his own thoughts into James‚Äôs answers mid-stream. Really annoying. Love them both, but Peterson needs to work on his conversational etiquette. He consistently got his guest off track in his responses just so he (Peterson) could get  agreement or validation on a thought he had‚Ä¶ADD much Jordan?
Great discussion‚Ä¶. Thanks.   What‚Äôs with the lobster jacket???
Since none of you will, I will address it.<br>Helluva suit JP!
After watching this podcast, <br>I noticed my brain grew 2x
Good discussion but could have been far far better. Jordan interrupts James far far too often.
OMG! That lobster blazer is amazing.
As usual  a very interesting conversation and discourse that for me, is usually on the money so to speak!  What really pisses me off is that  people who are involved in science have brought politics and religion into something that of course, should have ethics,  but as far as  god exists/ god doesn&#39;t exist  being a part of the whole thing is just bloody stupid,  agree to disagree  , why are so many people  not centre of self? If you are a well balanced individual, then these other aspects of life have their own place don&#39;t they?  You can see how the satanic global elites are doing what they can to invert everything and everyone with a lot of divide and conquer thrown in for good measure.....I can&#39;t believe how people are today compared to say 25 years ago.....I find it really hard to find any characters anymore!!! It&#39;s becoming robotic and one size fits all,  fascism.....or a kind of pseudo  Marxist/fascist  hybrid
You mean to tell me there are people out there who got massages from James Lindsay??
I LOVED this conversation.
Oh buddy, I had never heard of James Lindsay before listening to this. It would seem as though he&#39;s onto the Marxists in a way they reaaaaaaally don&#39;t like.<br><br>Shoutout to homeboy @conceptualjames, you know you&#39;re doing something profoundly good and right if the SPLC has an entire page dedicated to discrediting you.

Excellent observation, It trans morphs&#39; today into building back better as a metaphysical declaration destroy what was and is, to build anew what was intended in the garden of eden all along, thus begins true history  of their &quot;imagined&quot; world when the eschaton is immanentized. Here is the crux of the matter on this counterfeit salvation is only for the few and far between everyone else who helped in the &#39;social justice&#39; endeavor were just useful idiots.
How do I pay this guy
How much for a James Lindsay massage &amp; neomarxism lecture
It&#39;s easy to explain why most people would argue post-modernism is nothing like marxism: Hands up who really read Marx or German philosophies in its entirety? Even I would not and have not done it, but it is easier to see the connections when you know a little about the philosophy of Hegel (whose thoughts are super fascinating)  and that Marx was practically referring to his ideas. You could also make an interesting point of how philosophy of Kant compares to the latter Hegel. It&#39;s more or less connected and we are referring to systems interpreting the state of affairs in the world, so I would mainly point somewhat to  incommensurability, given our limited and little time and understanding of those who spent their entire time formulating big ideas and conceptions. Think it&#39;s great that people out there, like in this video, try to grasp the essence and historical background, very interesting, keep it up! üëèüëèüôåüôå
I&#39;ve never heard of this guy until I saw this interview. But I can tell you based on his mannerisms and his choice of words I would like to know him in person. There aren&#39;t a lot of people I can say that about. <br>And of course the real question is could he stand me?  LOL
How can people help? How do we fight this in our micro universes?
Two wonderful men, two towering intellects, and I believe, two future Catholics. Yeah!
I disagree on defining Marxism as religion or a bonafide philosophy. Marxism arises from a segment of humanity who do not connect with others as individuals. They see themselves and others as &#39;adjustable things&#39;. They believe they see the world more clearly than anyone else and superior in finding methods to make what they see as a messy inefficient social interactions under entrepreneurs more efficient by forcing all to comply with the rules they impose. This is not religion but a form of mental illness which leaves these people deficient in the mental acuity of others&#39; human value. This discussion misses this most basic observation.
Brilliant! I could listen to this all day! Such wonderful minds! Great men!
Whenever I hear the word privilege in the social context, I can&#39;t help but think it is prison politics writ large onto society.<br>You are being conned by cons.
Ever notice how everything that is determined as  &quot;woke&quot; is attributed to &quot;Marxism&quot; even though so-called Marxism has less influence than ever before? What are today&#39;s supposedly Marxists government? China, Cuba, and Vietnam. Notice how there is nothing remotely &quot;woke&quot; about them.
Lobster Suit‚Ä¶ Engaged
Im no scholar but it has been clear to me that all the ‚Äúsciences‚Äù are  essentially religious cults, beliefs /assumptions based upon flawed limited human understanding
‚ÄúPeople say that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about - WHICH IS RARELY THE CASE‚Äù! Ha! Love Dr. Peterson. I hope I am or will be a scholar and intellectual that he would approve of.
Wow, JP really meshed with this guy
I think we often mistake suffering for sacrifice and I don&#39;t think they are the same thing. You can suffer specifically because you refuse to sacrifice. You can suffer in ignorance because learning is a fearful enterprise. You can suffer in stubbornness because acceptance feels like the obliteration of the self. But there&#39;s no reward for suffering. Suffering begets more suffering. Only sacrifice leads to change.
Our society is taking a nose dive into explosive desperation.  Everyone on line is making their choice to decide on which side of the line they want to land. Truth be told, every bit of this is self designed rhetoric,  make believe nonsense.
That is a fantastic lobster jacket!
This was a very enjoyable and enlightening discussion.

Because those same women choose to make sure they go to every one of their children‚Äôs ballet recitals when men can‚Äôt always do that because they have to bring home the bacon. Because that‚Äôs what men have always done and are engineered to do. So while she‚Äôs at the ballet recital, another man will be making the deal that she missed. give up having children and getting married and devote your entire life to work like men do and you will be paid the same amount or here‚Äôs another smart thing to do build your own company like men do.
My God. All she can do is put words in his mouth. She seems so unbelievably unintelligent.
Non agreeable woman found success and in doing so she has alienated herself from all men with vile cancerous argument with no point. Literally unable to listen to reason.

Must hurt Channel 4 to have to keep this video up
Her voice is like a dentist&#39;s drill.  She&#39;s speeding up like a Catherine wheel. It&#39;s perilous to hear.
Since whe people have the &quot;right&quot; not to be offended? Must have missed it when I was taught human rights.
His patience is off the charts.
I have a magnet that says, Chicks rule.  Personally, I prefer 50/50.
First of all there&#39;s no construct as men and women. Its not biological. All men are women to some degree and all women are men to some extent. Male and female are social constructs and not biological. We are mixing social constructs with biological capabilities and that creates problems
Is this monster of a woman cancelled yet?
Not all men get the same salary. Why? Can we make a problem of this and what name should we give it? Reason for the pay gap is a problem for only the women . And they are not good enough to fix this problem. Deal with it. (if you can)
is this successful woman demonstrating how to close the gender pay gap?
An impressive interview. Both Peterson and Newman were genuine and real. Debating social reality can never be a zero-sum game and I thank both of them for the discussion.
This is the 5th time I have watched this.... classic JP. It never gets old.
Sir Zachery Micah Demers expertise in the world of finance is truly unparalleled. He has an extensive background in portfolio management, risk assessment, and financial planning, and he is constantly staying up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in the industry. His insights and recommendations have been invaluable to me over the years, and I have seen firsthand the tremendous impact that his guidance has had on my financial success.
By roughly the halfway point, she has a chance to pivot, you can see the moment, but she decides to keep going.  Epically wrong choice. Jordan Peterson doesn&#39;t tolerate any argument that puts feelings over facts and that&#39;s really what this interview was about.
Never grow up, otherwise you will be debating with channel 4, to educate people that know better with one eye on their salary, never apologize for sharing the life skills you have and do what you feel is right to you, I don&#39;t care in the old chestnut of Male v Female scenario, don&#39;t talk about it just do it. üòÜ
She‚Äôs ugly and rude at the same time
The world is not ready for men blowing up to this bs the likes of this woman is propagating.
I&#39;m a recent mass comm major graduate and had I spoke in response to Jordan the way she did, for any project I had to do with reporting news or moderating a debate, I would have flunked the project and likely the course.
This is the kind of interview that the interviewer asks and answers the questions!!
She does not listen, keep talking what she want to say, unpleasant to listen her words.
Should be down to tho shop m gym does not accept cash only cards for the coffee and other stuff .I do not carry cash anymore .down side is you know how much you are really spending with cash .
A man at the pinnacle of his career. This is what he has been doing for thirty years. He&#39;s been a lecturer for 30 years.
Close your eyes, and it&#39;s Kermit in incel mode.
Why is she so aggressive?
That woman is a complete arsehole and with that attitude is the reason she is talking about the subject‚Ä¶‚Ä¶mouth piece
Gosh she was annoying in this interview.
Her gotcha questions are so cringe worthy. Why can&#39;t journalists be independent? She just has an agenda and is going to war without listening.
Cna you call it an interview when the interviewer is only searching to &#39;wrong&#39; the other person. Is a bad faith interview.  She dismisses any response he gives, and looks for her next attack.   She repeatedly misquotes him, for her agenda.
She‚Äôs gaslighting right in front of our faces.
This is so funny because she‚Äôs trying so hard to make a point but it‚Äôs so stupid üòÇ
At no stage in the discussion of the &#39;gender pay gap&#39; was there any mention of vocational professions. These are low-paid and women gravitate towards them in a large part because when they are at school and deciding on a career path they don&#39;t tend to imagine themselves as being the main wage-earner in their future household. The burden of that is often imagined to - and generally does - fall upon the man, leaving the woman rather freer to pursue creative/vocational endeavours. One way in which long-standing cultural norms are favourable to women, no?
Clueless b*tch<br>Typical of these times<br>Wants everything without work‚Ä¶.handed on a plate<br>Special treatment <br><br>Women DONT  WANT TO BE CEO OF TO FTSE COMPANIES <br>too much hard work‚Ä¶facts<br>Sacrifices
This woman does not represent me... I don&#39;t expect the world to give me something i did not earn on my own...
MEN RULE
I believe everyone alive should watch this interview at least once in their life
This video is fantastic. It should go around the world. It shows a difference of women‚Äôs Lib, which is a total disaster and somebody who is normal, which is Professor Jordan Peterson. This video psychologist will be watching for hundreds of years down the line.
Professor Jordan Peterson is right again, and this lady she knows the opposite of reality men work a lot more hours. Women work a lot less hours that‚Äôs reality not fantasy.",PT29M56S

lol 3 hours of nazi kermit? Nope.
All my father taught me was that he absolutely hated 2 of his 7 brothers.he never forgave them,because hi mother died when he was young.He had a Lord of the Flies,type of upbringing.
He is full of anger
How bout your mother? She may have had brain damage from birth. They get a pass too .huh
I&#39;ve never felt a more emotionally relatable moment than when he said he felt unworthy of pretty much everything. I will stand up and make the most of this life
Dr. Peterson, thank you very much for your work. Your words have influenced my life in a huge way. I am a serious student of the Bible and have tried to serve the Lord for over fifty years. Your accumulated knowledge and desire to teach what you have learned has helped me in very wonderful ways. And I am passing it on. You are a great Warrior that has changed my life.  May God receive the Glory and may you be strengthened to continue this journey.  Please don‚Äôt let the evil one discourage you. It is very normal to be attacked when you are letting the Light shine! Please be of good cheer. Thank you. üôèüôèüôè

Reading these comments would bring a spartan to tears
Zero forgiveness for those who destroyed people&#39;s lives on the premise they were more &quot;special&quot; than others. Zero forgiveness for the puppet masters who wound them. What potential a person had or did not have was never anyone&#39;s to decide except the individual whose life it was.

When I convey things from don‚Äôt statements I perceive myself as negative. The overall affect of knowing all I shouldn‚Äôt do hasn‚Äôt added positivity, but implies more restrictions. My reflex to others pointing out all the don‚Äôt statements is to see who is not doing those things and assessing do I want to be like them.

I ask myself all of these questions.

Jordan Peterson is a Positively Inspirational Motivating Person
The parents use love as an excuse to not allow a boy to become a man or a girl to become a woman. I&#39;m not saying neglect or don&#39;t correct them when they&#39;re naive but from age zero to 19 is their golden years if that f*cks up then don&#39;t say anything when they start slacking out of confusion.

I&#39;m 48 just now knowing who I am and I am at the very beginning.
Many people ... &quot;to this day&quot; ... believe that without a god telling them what to do, they don&#39;t HAVE any access to that word ‚Äútruth.‚Äù <br><br>Example ... from the book TALK TALK TALK By Jay Ingram ‚Ä¶ an investigation into the mystery of speech ‚Ä¶ <br><br>If it sounds all too bizarre, take Jaynes‚Äôs favorite example, Homer‚Äôs Iliad. This epic poem comes down to us, Jaynes argues, from pre-conscious or bicameral times. He claims that there are almost no examples in the Iliad of anyone acting on his own free will, or making decisions of any kind that aren‚Äôt dictated by the gods. They never sit down and decide what to do. When Agamemnon steals Achilles‚Äô mistress, a god warns Achilles not to retaliate. Gods start the quarrels that cause the war, gods plan the strategy, a god leads the armies into battle, a god whispers to Helen, gods do everything. When Achilles reminds Agamemnon that he has stolen his mistress, Agamemnon replies, ‚ÄúNot I was the cause of the act, but Zeus ‚Ä¶‚Äù The Iliad is only one example: there are many others that can be interpreted as showing that people at that time needed their own auditory hallucinations to act.
Jordan Peterson, I love this guy- so articulate and well spoken and just so in line with the truth. However I think his messages are mostly the over elaborated obvious. These are messages that need to be reinforced to young people, especially the &quot;woke youth&quot;- people who create their own problems and adversity because they have none. People&#39;s struggles are relative; in that one person&#39;s struggle is not comparable to another person&#39;s. For example, one man can be homeless and addicted to hard drugs, and struggle the same as somebody else who missed the bus that morning (or something). Struggle is relative and related to that person&#39;s perception and tolerance. Too many people don&#39;t have true adversity in their lives, and that&#39;s how you get to where we are in today&#39;s culture. Jordan&#39;s talking about the big questions in a world around him that is so far behind. As they say, hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times. We are currently in the 3rd-4th phase.
wauw thank you
I wish you all to find that path, set goals, take care of yourselves, and unlock that greatness in all of youüíØ üî•
A lot of truth to this but it sucks that  the only thing they could think of is to incorporate a deity into the mix. Which strays from the facts
This man is truly a gift to this world.

Jordan Peterson is such a blessing to all. I achieved success after I practiced the steps below.
I have been so mentally abused through my life I feel so drained. I barley have enough love, happiness and energy to give to my child there is nothing left for me ..... I just sit there sit and live in my mind. I try to make friends, but these women don&#39;t care, and family have their own problems. I go to church and love God, but I just sit there. My ex wears me down with his problems and his suicidal thoughts. I just want live my life without having to worry and take everyone&#39;s problems into myself. I&#39;m tired................. I want to live.
Jordon, thank you. I am fighting  55 yrs of sex traffiking, molestation, and date rape. I dont date. I find men to be Vial pigs manipulated by frequecies, ( psychotronic mind control...they had to be ok with it already in their minds) and voice to skull to boost the libido for web site sex sales to support the web attached to the top elite...with the members of the justice system and freemason/ lucerferian church member businessmen, using all types of neighborhood watch groups to keep track of sex traffik victims, and create division of child and parent who also work in women children  protection Homes..recieves the childen after damage is done  ...absolutley diabolical. <br>Residential days was about sex traffiking ( no king). It was the scoop prior to that... It never changed...they just used frequency to divide families, make fights, and turn single mommas and babies homes into brothels...right now, entire BC home brothels are used to sell these families to camp men. Disgusting when police/judge/lawyers play a part in this crime<br>Wells Fargo, Black Rock, Vanguard, Triton etc...<br>Your speech about giving up Naivety, On betrayal of all relationships and walking away from who you were was very powerful. Today I need pride to move forward. I need to be proud of my minute successes in the layer pit of hell on this forsaken world of spiritually dead beings. <br>Only now I understand the saying&quot; let the dead bury the dead&quot; fb Rocksann Rouw.  ...ms Hazzel.<br>56 min is bang on. I dont know enough to make the bullshite stop.

Hey kids Jordan cuss&#39;s so it must be okey, wrong, it shows a lack of real education, we should be grown up enought to put profanity where it belongs, in the dung heap. This I have learned in life never put your trust in men, read it in Proverbs.
Eyes wide open üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÖ
What should we do when those lacking empathy or who choose to ignore it get in our way and we cant escape them? This seems t be many governments now who will destroy us for thier gain. The more I listen to him though the more i wonder if its to late for me. Have i  passed thr point of no return as my health limits what i can do.
Be careful what you think. All your thoughts and actions from the past has created who you are today. All of your thoughts and actions today will create who you are tomorrow. Block negativity out and stay positive.
It&#39;s never too late to make sense of your life! I waited until 45, which gave me much greater purpose through the justification of a more lengthy time of suffering. Life is simply living out our own exchanges, for the most part. Be better than yourself yesterday, ever gracefully so. üíõ
I know he is a divisive character, particularly in the PC, Woke world we now live in. But I find him to be one of the most inspiring, and reasoned people I have ever had the good fortune to listen to.

I wish he hadn&#39;t gotten into the COVID stuff. Mask kept me safe. Didn&#39;t get COVID working in retail!
Why does he get so much stick for simply identifying as a conservative . God knows no one is perfect. But there‚Äôs so much more to his thoughtful , articulate and sensitive man .
Really like Jordan but regarding Covid he is wayyy out in space.
One of the things that I appreciate most about working with Sir Zachery is his commitment to diversifying my income streams. I have always been aware of the importance of diversification, but I had never really put it into practice in my own investments. Sir Zachery helped me to see the benefits of spreading my investments across different asset classes and sectors, and he worked with me to develop a comprehensive portfolio that is designed to maximise returns while minimising risk.
Any honest person will take some home truths from this man, if its liked or not.
For me this man is a phony and his fake crying was the pinnacle of narcissistic copying‚Ä¶

About self-esteem. I had a year where I was a mess and I was going on a down spiral of depression. After the first therapy session there was ONE thing, extremely simple that I bought, that I should&#39;ve bought for the rental place a year before. And yes, the improvement was exponential from that point.<br><br>The rental place I was at did not have a toilet lid. It had the seat, but not the top lid. So I went, bought a 5‚Ç¨ one, new. Changed it and, the impact in had across my life, that first action was amazing. Something so easy and stupid, and the impact it had...
Jordon is simply a good man. I feel for him, he has a weight on his shoulders I could never bear.  Ask a questions and listen. You know very quickly if someone is false, an accusation no one could legitimately try to level at Jordon Peterson. I would hope
great
So good!! üî•üî•üî•

that was heavy
So sad to see that you would invite this person to your podcast. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to admire about someone whose views are so detrimental to women. Really makes me sad that he is in here and makes me want to unfollow your content despite loving everything else :(
Today Spotify recommended the song &quot;line of fire&quot; from Jos√© Gonz√°lez. While listening to this powerful podcast shred some of my skin, listening to the song afterwards seemed to completely have pulled my guards away. Prompted me to share my second comment ever youtube. Thank you Steven. Thank you Jordan. Something swifted in me. Keep doing what you do! ‚ù§
I love what I watch, but when I watch you push a product, I honestly  believe it discredits what has been said. I understand that it helps with the continuous of the show but seems so fake.
Thank you for inviting him. I am so sick of this PC west world we are living him.
Jordan Peterson is movingly compassionate and empathetic in a way that would make such a difference if we all were
This broke me so much because I lie to myself so much
Jordan really is a great person. I have learned a lot from him and his field when it comes to depression and anxiety. I highly recommend listening to his lectures regarding a topic you have of interest that he has covered.
I listen to this man morning and night. Eternally grateful for the rope he&#39;s handed humanity üôè
Everyone has common sense, but just because one has it, using it is not easy, no way; Jordan makes me wonder, does it take a large intake of self-education besides effort to speak and think engaged with intrinsic intelligence?
Jordan is a step-by-step process to pierce the shells of our egos by feelings and insight.
Jordan suffers from guilt

Jordan is brilliant and the most compassionate human I‚Äôve ever encountered. I embrace his truth because I feel in my soul that he is a gift to humanity. We need to listen and appreciate him more‚ù§
Um wait a second. Strike that.. Reverse it... I&#39;m gonna go clean my room. I&#39;ll be back.
&quot;If you want to help someone, the best way to help someone is not to give them advice, but to listen to them. &quot; That&#39;s something I needed to be reminded of
Jordan has clearly been way deep in the depths and found his way out, but knowing if he lets it it could go back there.  But he won&#39;t because he knows what going back would mean. The picture of giving a fuck!
Heavy heavy fuel for the soul. Run fast. Run cool. Eun iver no one. Always be true.
Jordan cares so much about his fellow man and just wants them to be successful and to have a wonderful life.
Guys you nailed that , two wonderful peers
I haven&#39;t watched this but I would bet my house that he bursts into tears at some point. He&#39;s an emotional trainwreck and a bore.
the word sustainable has been used to brainwash both of you
He is so geniune with every word he said.
I&#39;m proud to be born-and-raised in the same province as this gem of a human being. Praying for his spiritual eyes all the time.
I absolutely love the almost frustratingly complexity of Jordan Peterson. Somewhere in my soul I vicariously live through this man who I see is no less than virtuosity incarnate. Who has submitted himself to his purpose though I bet he would in effort to translate with the intent to inspire or incept say, &quot;be good&quot;. I know it is so much more than that. It is gravely more complex than that. This is why searching for the words for the question, &quot;How are you doing?&quot; he was lost for words so, he translated with a depiction of transformational music. Music has a way to resonate our very DNA, our soul, when no other thing can connect to our inner most dialog, thoughts and feelings. I see Jordan Peterson is a man that searches for the hidden absolute authority of God in every instance and fabric of our existence, both known and unknown, with the intent to connect to it and share it with others. His emotional responses I recognize and know what he is feeling as he internalizes incomprehensible wisdom. As intelligent as Jordan is, as eloquent as his vocabulary, as gifted as he has been gifted to convey these truths to the world, he scratches the surface on communicating all he intends to communicate. It is unimaginable to be in such a position, to live a life where simply speaking to the homeless in effort to live out the meaning of our lives, being good to the least, is the culmination and useful application of it all. Impossibly simple. Such is the gift and humility that is the God who in his perfection has been made known to us and we experience through submitting ourselves to the needs of others. Never let the tears discourage you from continuing to look into the window of Heaven, Jordan. Its is the Holy Spirit connecting to the Father in Heaven and you are given the moment to share in who He is and who you, and we all, are meant to be. Stare long and deeply at Heaven. For those moments are meant for you as a gift, there is an appointed time for you to share others and thank the Lord for his grace and mercy to share such things with us whom are so wicked.
No reason to have such large visual mics.
&quot;If you wanna help someone, listen to them&quot;<br><br>Really, thanks are not even close to show this man the appreciation he deserves.
TRUTH will save the world, and HIS name is JESUS CHRIST. For Christ said, I am the WAY, I am the TRUTH, and the LIFE. This is not the ‚Äúthe life,‚Äù as in, the life you were meant to live. The life you were meant to live is in Jesus Christ.

Jordan Peterson: ‚ÄúThere was plenty of motivation to take me out. It just didn't work"" 
https://www.youtube.com/user/GQRecommends",65016541,895329,258818,2018-10-30T10:50:14Z,"I wouldve left early because shes so difficult
Interview was rude
Lost me on &quot;I read about 200 books on ecology and economy...&quot;üôàüôàü§Øü§Øü§Ø<br>200 Books on a single subject...?<br>People are mad smart out there<br><br>I kinda want that....üòå
I think Jordan Peterson attracts such a big following in the things he says because people feel that their views aren‚Äôt being dismissed in the way that the modern established order has. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs saying anything radical. In fact, he‚Äôs just saying common sense things. He‚Äôs the voice of reason in an increasingly idealistic world.
I thought both of them had good answers
Mr. Peterson made her look very silly.
I don&#39;t wear make up and never have!!! Never been judge for it and been called beautiful most of my life with no make up so that&#39;s bs about her being judge!!!! She does it to make herself look better
She could only name 2 Biologist and she was like there&#39;s lots of people üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I think Helen lewis conducted herself really well here, it&#39;s certainly full of tense questioning but I feel Peterson is facing an intellectual equal where he&#39;s a bit more on his toes than usual. She&#39;s certainly of her own strong opinions, but I still feel she is kindly taking her shots and being clear minded in what she holds to be true. Folks are slightly delusional if they think Peterson told her off properly here, or that she is out of her depth etc. As a man I feel her reasoning and questioning are well measured and clearly and cleanly articulated with a few sharp comeback nicks that made me laugh out loud...
It&#39;s embarrassing to see these kinds of interview as a fellow woman. Girl didn&#39;t even try to pause and think if he were right and instead went over to other question and topic. Not great as she thinks she is<br><br>This is the reason i dont want to associate myself with feminists. They are giving the the org or whatever it is a bad rep. Tsh
Grats gentleman, you just attend great class with Mr Jordan Peterson for free
Imagine being her husband üò≥
Jeez, Peterson was in a bad mood in this interview!  I‚Äôve never seen him so dark, serious
She is so sure of herself, and ignorant to boot. Thinking she can just backchat one of Jordan&#39;s thoughts as if she&#39;s even on the same plain as him is just ludicrous. I get the impression she&#39;s never allowed herself to truly listen and learn, because that would take admitting you don&#39;t yet know something.
Keep people like her in Britain!!! Clowns the lot of them !!
where are Ukrainian feminists when the war started?
JP was just incredible in this interview. It&#39;s amazing how someone can be so calm and yet brutal at the same time.
Love the fact they didn&#39;t give him a proper mic and  badgered him with hard questions. This is truly some modern day media coverage there.
I hope this young lady watches her interview many years later and sees how child like her reactions were to being confronted with truth. My guess is it went over her head. She was wayyyyy out of her league on this one.
The courts overturning Rowe was nothing more than finally have a majority on the court who have read and care what the constitution says.   The 10th amendment makes very clear that the federal government has no authority to be involved in anything without specific constitutional authority.  Until one side or the other managed to amend the constitution, abortion is simply none of the federal government&#39;s business. <br><br>I am 100% pro-choice, but Rowe was wrong and should have been overturned.  Fight it at the state level or amend the constitution.
Good Lord imagine being married to this woman.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYQpge1W5s&amp;t=1m07s"">1:07</a> &quot;what do you think I believe&quot; girl he cannot read your mind that is a trap so you could say he was wrong and respond &quot;no ...&quot;
Boy did Harvard University make a yet again enormous personnel failure in not being able to keep him teaching , &quot; of the Square&quot; in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Maybe the 3rd waive feminists just could not contain him. She is Schooling the host in basic statistical analysis.
On the point of abortion, one man&#39;s views on abortion does not reflect all men&#39;s views and also there are some women that are apposed to the notion of abortion so I believe you can&#39;t use that fact as a basis of men oppressing women...
I don&#39;t  exactly agree everything Peterson says, but listening to what he has to say is so inspiring, intriguing and challenging to one&#39;s mindset and intellect. He truly pushes the boundary and opens a lot of doors to meaningful conversation
wow this goblin is dumb but you could never tell her that, you can&#39;t explain to dumb people why they are dumb because they are too dumb to figure it out
Thank God for jordan peterson
I didn‚Äôt even know what this was  Jordan: Machiavellianism, now it‚Äôs all making sense to me, rig it everywhere
What annoys me though is that she trys to establish at least some common ground in the first 20 minutes and he just pushes back on everything she says. Why would you do that if you want to convince her?
Jordan Peterson does a very good job in this inverview. But he does have some off statements. While I also disagree with the whole &quot;patriarchy&quot; narrative for example, his argument that the hierarchies are mainly based on competence is not true. They are based on competence to a certain extent, and to some other extent based on systemic feedback mechanisms and luck. He even talks about those feedback mechanismis, which lead to pareto distributed outcomes, a lot, so I don&#39;t understand why he makes the false argument that the &quot;main&quot; reason is competence. But those feedback mechanisms are also no &quot;patriarchical oppression&quot; as supposed by the left. Those feedback mechanisms occur in all sorts of systems.
When you able to shut down someone who believes in patriarchy without bringing up the fact woman have been getting more and more depressed since being introduced into the ‚Äúyou have to work now‚Äù era instead of the choice to work or stay home  era
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
This lady has the audacity to try and ‚Äúput words into Mrs Peterson mouth and has no idea how far she is behind in most topics. And perpetual making statement in a way that they BOTH agree with. How arrogant and even ignorant to keep making statements in a way that Peterson ‚Äúsimply has to agree with‚Äù but is not!<br>She‚Äôs so not in his league and refusing to realise this makes me cringe and even disliking this ‚Äúinterview‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Hope you got my last comment u are a special kind of genius in this world we live in.....and all it takes is seeing it from a different perspective hope to see more videos from you in the future even though you said your equipment was stolen......stay black homie ‚úåÔ∏èüòâüòâI appreciate your contact we are all brothers in Christ and god
You are a special kind of genius like so very few people on this planet right now.....and u got the magic eye to see this stuff.......its not so much intelligence but a state of mind and awareness and just seeing this different than the average person in general (which is what makes US targets) would.....we just see things closer to reality and it all boils down to simple choices and viewing things from a different perspective.....keep ya head up homie....i look forward to more of your videos even though i told me ur camera equipment was stolen i believe you because of the vids u make i think ur a genuine person with a pure heart....stay black my friend lol ‚úåÔ∏èüòâüòÇ
Four years later this man has been proven right on EVERY point he made.<br>ie..  math is now racist because African American blacks have a general lower IQ than Asians,Hispanics,Sub Saharan Africans,South Americans the list goes on.<br>These are FACTS and they don&#39;t care about your feelings.
i dont know what to say or how describe how i feel, this man s a legend aye. <br>i mean anyone would of just go nuts ? <br>i try to be civilized and all, but getting accused over and over like that, honestly i probably would of made myself look actually bad lol
Men=Order, Women= Complaint
I struggle to see that there is a patriarchy at all, I went from a left wing feminist to a left leaning centrist. Both the gender pay gap and the patriarchy have been completely debunked. Human beings have a competence hierarchy, the more competent you are the higher you rise. Yes there are men that rise to the level of their own incompetence, but then I have seen women do the same. Women in many senses in western societies have more rights than men do. Women elect our leaders and make 85% of the consumer decisions. Women are relevant, powerful and are important and loved. Feminism seeks to rewrite our history and distort it. Feminism is no longer about equality, it is about equity and equality of outcome. Feminism doesn‚Äôt serve women or men and throwing gender ideology into the mix basically nullifies women, makes bathrooms and prisons completely unsafe for women.
Shamed her over and over.  What a great man.
He should run for priminster of canada
4 years later and in comparison with what we know now, you might say this interview is kinda scary. JP really is the genius of our century.
She is not even remotely in his intellectual league.
She reflects on the question of why it‚Äôs ok for her to occupy a position of power and privilege, be it because of her gender or convenience by talking about her beliefs
Whenever I feel bad about my professional shortcomings, I come to this video.
I feel sorry for husband. I bet she dominates the marriage.
Peterson is great in this, however the interviewer is also very engaging, probing and guides the discussion very well.
I&#39;m neither a fan nor a foe of Peterson. He seems spot on about some things but on others I think it&#39;s a real stretch. For example, his analogy to lobsters and his interpretation of bible stories. I can see why so many men are drawn to him as they try to figure out their role now that women have made some progress toward being treated equally. One thing that irritates me to no end is when he insists there are personality differences between men and women because women generally score higher on agreeableness and men score higher on aggression. Those tests may indicate what is but certainly don&#39;t tell us why (nature versus nurture) or to what degree our physical differences are responsible for that outcome. At any rate, Helen Lewis interviewed him brilliantly. I think she was extremely controlled but he seemed to come undone; to the point that in a few spots, rather than debate with any logic, he resorted to &quot;making fun&quot; of her. To me, that&#39;s a clear sign that he&#39;s at a loss.
Jordan Peterson is &quot;SELLING/TELLING&quot; the honest to God TRUTH!!! Something that seems to be becoming extinct in this day and age!<br><br>I SUPPORT JORDAN PETERSON ON EVERYTHING HE STANDS FOR AS IT PERTAINS TO STANDING AGAINST THE P0WERS THE BE WHO SEEKS TO MAKE ORIGINAL, BIOLOGICAL MALE/FEMALE HUMAN BEINGS NON-EXISTENT BY  ENTERTAINING THIS RIDICULOUS PRETENSE OF GIVING &quot;RIGHTS&quot; TO SOMETHING THAT WILL NEVER BE REAL/TRUE!",PT1H42M14S

That Channel 4 interview with a moron still doesn&#39;t make sense.<br>Was it staged?
I greatly appreciate Jordan&#39;s heart for those who feel left behind and lost. Thanks Jordan for continuing to push for insightful reflection and amicable discussion in the pursuit of the underlying truths of our societies.
One of the most interesting and intelligent people I‚Äôve ever seen interviewed.  Thank you.

I am not a religious person but Jordan Peterson is about as close to a modern day prophet as you get.
Tate/Peterson/Morgan/Biden... people LOVED by others <br>Yet i couldn&#39;t imagine them in a movie as anything other than the villain haha<br>Seriously man, why is that
His fake crying is so ridiculous. This man is a con artist
He is a global legend
Mr Peterson should be the leader of the wef, <br>He has my vote and millions more.<br>Let&#39;s all vote on the wef.
Why on earth does Mr Morgan focus on pointless footballers?
Wow just Wow.
Solzhenitsyn was a great liar. Everything that has to do with his works - it‚Äôs total lie. Amazing to hear your judgments about that. What‚Äôs more, this traitor has still been treated well both in the usa/Europe and in Russia. Weird thing üò¢
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTv5feWd9dk&amp;t=54m47s"">54:47</a> so we saw what happened this winter. You weren‚Äôt that right, Mr. Peterson, were you?
Amazing how in every case JP says &quot;stand up straight, tell the truth, defend your position&quot; but when it comes to Ukrainians his solution is &quot;bow down, be afraid, keep quiet, surrender&quot;. Why didn&#39;t PM call him out on that?<br><br>Also this shows how JP doesn&#39;t know much about the historical and political side of Europe and WW2. Poland was razed to the ground by both Germans and Russians and Polish people still consider it a victory - because they never cooperated with invaders and kept resisting throughout, until they regained their independent state. People can choose to suffer greatly if their only alternative is to become slaves. You&#39;d think Peterson of all people should understand that. Sad and dissappointing.<br><br>Oh and we didn&#39;t freeze in the winter and we didn&#39;t &#39;find out&#39;. Ukrainians keep fighting. Another comment that aged badly.
On the &quot;Ukrainian Issue&quot; he was, is and will further be wrong as hell. But as for the rest: Thumbs up. - OK, the interview is from SEP 2022...
Hey piers, stop interrupting people while they are talking. Find a space to speak, not while your guest is talking.
The lost egos clinging to a weak support group.<br>  The world according to J.P. <br> Youre weak of you need this nonsense.  You won&#39;t grow thru someone else.  You&#39;ll get lost.
I think he&#39;s amazing
Interesting for such a polarizing figure, there seem to be very few negative comments. Either his opponents can&#39;t be bothered to watch the interviewer or I can&#39;t be bothered to read 9,694 comments...
His flight of thought about ruzians again proves the truth that a person can be an extraordinary expert in one field, such as psychology, and at the same time be completely incompetent in another. Moreover, all these &quot;holomodor in the Caspian Sea&quot;  performances is fuel for ruzian propaganda narratives.<br>Ruzia is a big isis with nuces, and it should be defeated.
I have more respect for Macy gray lol
Jordan is such an inspiration to me , what a.legend
One of the things I admire most about Dr.Peterson is the clarity and consistency of his message. Such integrity is rare in this era of bullshit.
Rockys speech to his son. You&#39;re welcome.<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/5JAHAFvcr2o"">https://youtu.be/5JAHAFvcr2o</a>
What a fool I am to have dislike this man for so long. It‚Äôs been hard to accept his character, personality. <br>Now I understand, I see his heart and compassion more, I feel bad for all of us in this era where so much technological evolution has happen and yet in our minds we are still children‚Äôs of the world. Doing so much arm to each other in quest of ego..<br><br>I really hope the best for us, try to smile and spread happiness. If you are reading this, thanks for your time and be your best, you can do it üí™
Jordan Peterson is a wold treasure ! How can ppl today be so blind and deaf  not to listening to him ?
Listen to this man great chat and said as it should be üòÅ
The comment by PM with regards to Putin is kind of shady. Brilliant response from Dr. Peterson.
Brilliant and intellectually provocative.
dear mr morgan, please shut up and let him talk
Absolutely love Jordan Peterson, but he needs to stick to other subjects and leave geopolitics to people who know what they‚Äôre talking about it, because when he talks about geopolitics, he sounds like a complete,l moron.
What Peterson seems to be saying is that he is manipulating his audience. In search of an optimum outcome, Peterson is saying that nothing he says comes from sensory or emotional input. Compared to actual thinkers, such as Stephen Fry, Hawking, Dawkins, or even Churchill (all of whom use/ used their instincts and intelligence). Peterson deeply wants to join an elite club that doesn‚Äôt welcome him. I see an antsy, tan man who has no humility or humanity. For me, he yells when he talks, he never laughs or smiles or cares. In brief, he&#39;s a pseudo-intellectual, and his word games are tiresome. One never knows though. He‚Äôs clearly appealing to someone.
So, if I&#39;ve watched some of Peterson&#39;s videos and read his books, and I was going through some rough times and thought that talking to him in person might help me, I could just call him up and ask him to come over to my place and talk? And he would accept?<br><br> The only reason Peterson agreed to do this was because the person asking to talk to him was world-famous athlete Cristiano Ronaldo, and he wanted to exploit Ronaldo&#39;s fame in order to enhance his own public profile. This is what I despise about &quot;famous&quot; psychologists (like Peterson and Doctor Phil), they are using the suffering of other people to enhance their own wealth and celebrity. They claim that they are helping people, but the help they provide is incidental to their primary goal, which is to enrich and empower themselves.
A good man
Love this man
Very happy to hear this interview

some pretty elite people in our society are trying to squash masculinity.  Thats the issue.  If you look at television ads during tv shows.  They always show how dumb males are.  Its sexist and offensive.  The same people who go along with that are trying to get rid of masculinity.  That&#39;s the real issue.  And its going to be a big problem in the future in our society

We&#39;ve had all this knowledge.  It&#39;s called God&#39;s interpreted words.. GOD SAID THIS.BUT WE CAN&#39;T INTERPRET the bible&#39;s words in a simple perspective.  REMEMBER. Some people cant read. So we can make n explain God&#39;s wo easier to comprehend..
People elevate to people of the same intelligence also your easy for most men to look up to. Like a dad most of them dont have.
I am man hear me roar. And i did it my way. ,,!, you if you get in my way.
your viewerbase is mostly male cause GUYS are the ones who are actually really interested in how things work. girls are not so much like that. so80% of psychology students are women. great. most of them are just gona go by the book..
Tear down the man, and he‚Äôll give you his country. That‚Äôs why they hate Jordan so much. They want victims, Jordan creates victors!
Mind Begs the Question:<br>To Support and Aid an Apartheid State<br>Righteous,Evil?
I can&#39;t stand videos that edit in stock scenes   in place of the full clip of Peterson talking.
I was so eager to work after college to make $$$ and live a lifestyle that I wanted.  Decades of indoctrination by my dad did that
Let me guess, it‚Äôs their fault.
Definitely not responsibility there genius.<br>WOMEN.<br>100% .<br>AND YOU REALLY DON&#39;T HAVE TO BE A GENIUS TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUTüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
people have medical issues - Jordan Peterson is a fraud
I delted social media for 3 years str8 and improved the hell out of my mental stateup intill now when my mother passed
Education is garbage.  I achieved more writing music with hands on teaching but in school that training turned into abusive behavior by the school. Media is a monopoly. The government owns our future. The government controls monopolies. Music is media.
The Ritual
I find the opposite of this is true....i could care less about responsibility don&#39;t want it...feel burdened when i have it. Rather engage in low class pleasures video games...eating sleeping. perfectly content nor do i care what others think of me for feeling and acting this way
The actual reason is this... 85% of men are homosapian talking apes, and not the verb &quot;human being&quot;, that which is more then animal. Only 15% of men are above 130iq, which is where morals and ethics can override instincts and the stimulus of the immediate environment. <br><br>Jp just doesnt want to discourage you 85%, as to be honest about your physical limitations as talking apes.
Makes perfect sense to me! I&#39;m no young kid either. Unfortunately I spent a lot of my life avoiding responsibility, unless it was in my face, and seeking thrills in objects and partying.<br>Guess who also suffered a lack of self for too long? Jeez, if I could wind back time.
So I&#39;ve learned If you go to hell you&#39;ll have the absolute worst demon punishment You can ever imagine and that is how new demons are created with about thirty years of insanity and zero thoughts of your life ever again, It&#39;s actually worse but it&#39;s hard to explain If you want to try and understand you can try to ask the demon angels they&#39;ll probably tell you if your spiritual Senses are high enough to talk to them in your head or Use a pendulum and be very professional or You can use substances, The best I found is tramadol I think any opium would work, Alcohol/weed isn&#39;t good enough, but be careful<br><br>I also found out that you can make The angels if you torture them enough to call their supervisors which after 2 or 3 should get you their demon God on Earth which can&#39;t leave Earth and can be infinitely manipulated by regular demons like lilith because they are so unintelligible, Which means they can force them to give them their energy and then banishing them, causing an infinite loophole of free energy for demon life, Which they love and will give you anything they can
It‚Äôs men passively reaching out for help.
I am so glad to hear this because this gives me a better direction for when I teach my junior high class. I am a fairly new teacher, but I noticed I have the most trouble with the teenage boys in my class. I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time but now listening to this , something clicked in my mind. When I gave the boys jobs in my class to help They were so eager to do so that they almost tripped over themselves and I saw a very nice agreeable part to them that I had never seen before. Usually the two people that I would have told me it was horrific the rest of the time in class. But that one time it was great. So I‚Äôm going to keep this video in mind. It is quite sad that many men struggle with this because of our counter culture. <br>I also didn‚Äôt realize that most of his audience on YouTube and in person are men. 90% wow. I love his videos they have really helped give me something to strive for even as a woman. I had a really bad day today and listening to a couple of his videos one about fear and the other about casting pearls before swine was amazing and many others. My favorite that has impacted me so much is realizing that telling the truth and being sincere and my morals and values and opinions will cause my life to become an adventure. Very few people in reality do this is what Peterson was explaining. Yeah all the time can cause some scary conflicts and even with a large group of people and feel like wearing some tight spots but standing up and all situations will be the most fulfilling of our life
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI__r2U8jX0&amp;t=4m21s"">4:21</a> Ouch...
What I got from this is get off your ass and do something wonderful
The reason any human is lost , it&#39;s because they have it run down by men like you.   Christ came for the lost sheep of Israel.  They were lost because of religious control.  Your doing the same , you think everyone thinks like you.   They don&#39;t.
For the past year and a half I have been struggling deeply with self confidence and negative thoughts. I want to be the best man I can possibly be and grow/learn while I am young. I still struggle to this day, however JP‚Äôs lectures have been a great help. God definitely shines through this man!
The government without sense of the feelings to working day by days.  Without thinking if right or wrongs that must following the each revelation destroys the successful!  I‚Äôd the successful today‚Äôs that get themselves to the justices as everyone‚Äôs can judges of theirs the life‚Äôs beings under the facts showing to themselves of the decisions carrying onto next or just left the rest of Asia‚Äôs doing the things differently and living into theirs the rights as everyone as today‚Äôs
The peoples in Canada calls themselves is first peoples lands into the equation that they dint gave fact if evident to proves themselves whatsoever.  Everything‚Äôs on earth is because the Uk Emperor thought the ways used the government with Globalization to damage of peoples life‚Äôs in different situations long ago as experiments carryover the generations down to separated the experiments and the one had the rights mindset different and didn‚Äôt tells themselves the problems spreading to the other‚Äôs call themes as living in delusions world‚Äôs most dangerous with peoples today‚Äôs against to each others.
Men watch his videos because they make sense to men.
Not only does this guy ramble, but he doesnt back alot of his information with facts.  Two, he puts too much &#39;fake&#39; emotion behind his voice in attempt to sway opinion.  Take away the emotion, give me facts.
HA!!! Women are agreeable?  Yeah right, maybe when it comes to being told what or how to do something by a boss in a setting where they&#39;re making money.  In a relationship?  They&#39;ll argue with you over everything, including the shade of the sky just for the sake of arguing and will until the end of time.
I cant have kids I am successful but empty I have more than enough, but he is right I dont have anything worth living for.
Jordan Peterson is the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
This man is legendary
This professor has a foul mouth.
When I went to WIU, I was shocked to find out that it was the Asian and Black girls that put the most effort into studies.  Also, I found that, even in these groups, that the more money that the family had the less that the students would study.
Why is it a surprise that 90% of the audience is male.... RESPONSIBILITY.   Nothing makes the female of the species run like hell more than responsibility!
I am not a young guy anymore. The end of my life is nearer than the beginning of my life. I am single, have no children.<br>Last summer at a cemetery of a nearby village I coincidentally discovered the old and abandoned grave of a little baby boy who passed away many, many decades ago. I know nothing about him or his parents (whose grave I found too), but no one cares about his small grave anymore. His grave, slightly damaged as it was, was set for removal, but for some reason still not very clear to me, I repaired his grave and got official approval his grave will not be removed, and for almost a year now I am responsible for taking care of his old, little grave.<br>Extremely short as his life has been, taking care of his grave just feels the right thing to do for him.<br>And, perhaps most important of all, the responsibility feels good.<br><br>Jordan Peterson is a very wise man.
Makes you ponder what the writers of the Simpson&#39;s are psychology promoting hmmm
I think, quite possibly, men who listen talk to women they know, and they mention &quot;Jordan Peterson&quot;, and then the women listen, and watch.
Lost? 90 % huh? You‚Äôre not lost if you don‚Äôt know it.
So what is the meaning to life? All I got from this video was a bunch of word salad and inspirational feel-good nonsensical malarkey. This dude is just another fucking religion to give some meaning to life. That&#39;s all he is
I managed to get to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI__r2U8jX0&amp;t=03m40s"">03:40</a>.  I couldn&#39;t take any more.  Sorry.  I&#39;ll try again in 7 months, maybe.
I don‚Äôt think so.
&quot;For men there is nothing but responsibility&quot; <br>No hate, no comparison. This is my life and I&#39;m realizing that I have to face this reality head on.",PT9M18S

I am dumber for having listened to this.
It&#39;s always so spot on with this guy, and yet that last few remarks made me think...<br>Why shouldn&#39;t conservatives negotiate? not give in but satisfy the ideologs.<br>The way we heal is by finding how to heal together, not whos healing is the word of god.<br>If the non-radicals were on social media LGBTQ wouldn&#39;t be such a clickbait.
I&#39;m not trying to be woke but you inability to express yourself- doesn&#39;t clear most of these ppl imo. And I was open to a reason -But THAT is not a just reason.
Cue all the hateful trolls who comment on every Jordan Peterson video about how stupid and shallow he is. Idiots all.
But shouldn&#39;t we either be able to explain why we do things or not do them?<br><br>Marriage provides a stable framework to raise children.<br><br>The evergreen represents immortality seen; a symbol of surviving the cold dark winter in the height of the solar winter, crowned with the light you mentioned that shines in the darkness.<br><br>Should we not seek to either understand why we do things, or stop doing them?<br><br>Am I wrong, chat?
&quot;You can&#39;t appease a snake.  It&#39;s a big mistake.&quot; ~ Jordan Peterson
&quot;You can&#39;t appease a snake&quot;.  Truer words never spoken.
&quot;You can&#39;t appease a snake&quot; as it&#39;s goal is to swallow you whole. The radicals are insatiable. No matter how far they advance, they will always demand more.
That&#39;s a hell of a necktie.
Great ending
People tend not to like Ayn Rand but she was another person through her novels that showed the evil of the woke. The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged really speak to the times.
The late Roger Scruton was a very clever exponent of conservatism.
This reminds me of something I read about Euler.  He would sit amongst company who would question him on philosophical topics, and he would give his take on things, until the more skilled communicators on the topic would eventually pin him. His response was to throw his hands up in the air and chuckle.
Well said except the Christmas tree. It validates he has not read scripture because it is mentioned. Most people still follow blindly. Hell, there is something‚Äôs I do but I don‚Äôt claim to be anyone..
In America we are in no way obligated to care what other people think. I don&#39;t need to justify my decisions or choices to anyone for any reason.<br><br>He&#39;s right on the &#39;getting involved&#39; in local government. Conservatives in power as of late are weak and spineless. We need strong people with strong convictions in positions of leadership and power. <br><br>That&#39;s one of the ways we might be able to get back the America we once loved.
Jordan Peterson was speaking of following along with the NDP of Grant Notley around 40 years ago. There were still a lot of whackos in the NDP back then but it is completely out of control in the NDP in Alberta now. Grant&#39;s daughter Rachel heads the Alberta NDP and there is now no idea too crazy for their rabid consumption. They especially <i>hate</i> anything Christian--except as they would define it, which is not how God defines anything. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§®ü§®ü§®
‚ÄúJustify marriage!‚Äù  Simple.  God ordained it here:  Genesis 2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
&quot; that the people who had built productively that had the moral upper hand &quot;. Great quote from him.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNzpriXhAJc&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> I&#39;m glad JBP pushed back against this. What you think may be so &quot;obviously&quot; true may not be to someone else
What JP fails to mention (in the case of defending some conservative institution) is that it&#39;s MUCH easier to criticize something than to rebuild new institutions. And it seems that all the left is capable of doing is to criticize. Maybe the response should be &quot;come back and criticize me when you&#39;ve built your own successful institution&quot;.
Never play the radicals game, everytime you do you give them credibility, if you act like they have the right to demand something of you, you are in effect GIVEN them that right, and you cant take it back, and they will use YOUR compliance as an example till force even more people to comply.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNzpriXhAJc&amp;t=6m26s"">6:26</a> This is why I can never fully commit to Ramsey‚Äôs ‚Äúbrand‚Äù. Just straight up prideful and pompous. You‚Äôre too ‚Äòright‚Äô to face the person who‚Äôs attacking your fundamental ethos? That sounds like a coward to me. I never like to use the word ‚Äòboomer‚Äô but he‚Äôs the ‚Äòboomer‚Äô that fucked my generation and then turns around and scolds us on how wrong we‚Äôre doing it. Fuck you Ramsey.
I love Jordan Peterson but the Christmas tree was actually originally called a Jesse tree and it was a dead branch we actually used to do with growing up and then when Christ was born you would get a vibrant evergreen signaling new life and the savior
Such clarity of thoughts and razor sharp precision in his way of expressing, this guy is just unbelievable !!!
Mad respect for JP but he clearly doesn‚Äôt understand the difference between culture wars and politics or public policy. He astutely notes how liberals have run amok culturally but completely fails to comprehend how the conservatives have failed to lead or evolve in politics or public policy.
Maybe Dr. Jordan Changed His Political Thinking when in late 2019 Peterson sought &quot;emergency&quot; detox from benzodiazepine addiction.
Sort of reflects that old saying along the lines of, &#39;If you are not a socialist when you are young, you have no heart. If you are not a conservative when you are older, you have no brain.&#39;
Dr Peterson is an awesome resource of how we really think and how to articulate a position that ultimately doesn‚Äôt allow a rebuttal
So true - the DEMS have nothing to do - so they in fact push this communist nonsense.
There is a great quote (that I on&#39;t have time to look for) from Widrow Wilson about the US making weapons when he was asked why he was turning to th evil capitalist companies ..... He basically said - &quot;none of us liberals can make a single thing....&quot;
Points well made but , those radicals that want total control over the populace have gotten control of the schools on every level . When the progandized populace reach voting age they tend to vote in more monsters like the ones that took over their thinking through the schools . Laws get passed to centralize authority in an all powerful Government thus an almost unbreakable system gets perpetually established .
Good honest people don&#39;t tell you what to do, they show you how to do it with their own example!üôèüá∫üá∏üåè
Peterson sounds reasonable here, but I still find conservatives much more scary than liberals. There are radicals on both sides.
People only ever move from the left wing to the right wing way of thinking. I wonder why... <br>Something to di wuth experience/wisdom perhaps?
Involuntary (maybe?) rhyme towards the end when J.P. said: <br>&quot;You can&#39;t appease a snake<br>It&#39;s a big mistake&quot;
If we don&#39;t intervene sooner than later, the only option that&#39;ll be left is violence.
Dave ramsey immediately showed what the problem has been with His response. Conservatives not ready to defend their opinion and not feeling. The need to has gotten to where we are as far as losing Everything we have
oh Jordan, all well and good but take a visit to CPAC convention and tell me you&#39;re impressed
He‚Äôs still liberal just not a communist
JP is a pathetic grifter for the bitter and the hateful white supremacists incels.  He is the specialist of the right wing extremist&#39;s idiotic straw man.
Dr. Peterson is exactly right. The LEFT IS taking everything from us. Including the school in our home town. I have been thinking about getting involved on the school board, as I watch the school crumble before our eyes. Trans story hour, the gay pride flag flown and we can do nothing about it...except PAY for it with tax dollars. Sad times.
I‚Äôm as he describes, I cannot verbally communicate my values thoughts feelings, so when I‚Äôve been picked apart so many times. But I vote and I vote with my with my feet

Jordan Peterson appears resentful and angry. I think he has lost his cool-headed attitude. Time for him to take stock and be more reflective. <br>I&#39;ve learnt a great deal from him, and want him to be more careful and considerate with his words.

you know how well organized the woke piranhas are, when even the host who like&#39;s Jordan start the program with &quot;there is a lot of things you can accuse him of&quot;<br>Severe Mistake
Dr Peterson is the best. I&#39;d highly recommend Meaningwave, a style of music where many of Jordan&#39;s talks (along with other great thinkers like Alan Watts, Jocko Willink, David Goggins, Gary V, etc) are put to music so that what they&#39;re saying really sticks with you. It&#39;s essentially a new form of technology that&#39;s changed my life.
Exactly my thought whenever my wife corrects me, my ego would want to refuse the correction then I realize that&#39;s how society works...
What in the actual hell is Ramsey doing associating with this absolute fruitloop and clown car of a person.
Totally loved this!  Way different from Dr. Peterson&#39;s other conversations.  Hoping these thoughts can help inspire us to change.  Thank you Dave and Jordan!!

This guys an idiot. He &quot;has money up to [his] neck&quot; he said, right?
question that occured to me when jordan was talking about not doing something if it can&#39;t be done profitably.<br>How could we make helping the homeless out of homelessness profitable? and I don&#39;t mean by keeping them down like the current people do.
when will ramsey do the work to understand btc
I think Peterson is the type to talk to himself in the mirror, just to see and to hear himself talk.
Well. It is not just about being ethical towards the customer, but also how you treat your employees. You can treat those working for you badly and become a fantastic success. That would be interesting for the conversation to ponder.
If everyone just listens to Jordan&#39;s words, the world would be a better place...god bless all..even the woke left üôè
Thanks Jordan and host!
We should bring back the term screwball. When one of these &quot;woke&quot; characters mouths off say &quot;shut up screwball&quot; nobody listens to a screwball.

Omg Dr. Peterson with a HUGE      point about his deal w/ Daily Wire &amp; then about how you&#39;d also want a deal that benefits both parties with your wife.<br><br>I wonder what guy was in the news lately for making outrageous contract demands to the Daily Wire AND had some unflattering home footage btwn him and his now ex wife surface...believe his name is something like Cleveland Srowder?

How To Deal With Negative Thoughts & Feelings - Jordan Peterson,"Jordan Peterson discusses the relationship between negative thoughts and feelings and how identifying and challenging automatic thoughts can help alleviate anxiety and misery. He also touches on the dangers of totalitarian ideologies and offers strategies for addressing distressing memories and difficulties at work.

Jordan Peterson is a Canadian media personality, clinical psychologist, author, and professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. He began to receive widespread attention as a public intellectual in the late 2010s.

Sounds hilarious, the biggest, largest, most prominent issue for all humanity is the refusal provided by human nature to allow us as human beings to acknowledge human nature as the controlling agent in our lives, our societies and our conclusions.<br>Societies and their cultures are heavily influenced by human nature, religion, morals, ethics, etc. etc. are all constructs created to control human nature. Laws are created to confine human nature so that we may live in societies.<br>Currently we as human beings are faced with capitulating to human nature, we are promoting it.<br>The key to understanding human nature is that it is perverse and should be acknowledged as such. The creation of nuclear weapons can not be rationalized without the fault of this vagary.<br>The least acknowledged and the most perverse vagary of human nature is that it wants you to destroy yourself, therefore the negative thoughts etc. etc. The conclusion that human nature is and has been formed to preserve and perpetuate life is not entirely true simply because it is part of our nature to be perverse.<br>You throw in some inherited behaviors and you have a creature that sustains life or not by human nature&#39;s rules, not ours. <br>It is good to be able to be analytical and make decisions based on the conclusions but it&#39;s just the doctor being the doctor, he is not outside looking in, he is on the inside looking out.<br> Human nature dominates our lives and denys us the ability to do anything about it.<br>The strength of one&#39;s convictions is also a part of human nature.
You know, the standard answer postulated in psych and spirituality is that ultimately what everyone is afraid of deep down is death, but I think we need to reexamine the validity of this.  When I actually talk with people, I have never found anyone afraid of death.  Not one. <br> <br>People fear pain, sickness, poverty, helplessness (loss of locus of control), suffering, disability, homelessness, rejection, isolation, alienation, lovelessness, meaninglessness, loneliness, and many other things; but as for death, they very often tell me (unasked) they would welcome death, that they don&#39;t like earth at all and long for the day when they can go &quot;Home.&quot;  They&#39;re very frank about it.  Nobody likes pain and suffering, so the process of getting to the exit door, that they may fear.  But I have never met anyone who feels any aversion to the exit door itself. <br> <br>I also live near a bridge over a deep gorge, to which people very often drive from other states to jump because it&#39;s such a reliable exit door.  When I lived in Seattle, there was another such bridge where people often came to reliably die.  Our suicide and attempted suicide rates, not just from bridges but from pills and handguns,  do not support the idea that we all avoid death more than anything else. <br><br>Consider also the wealthy people who jumped from buildings for something as small as the crash of their stocks in 1929.  All they were facing was a less luxurious lifestyle, but more than a few men chose the exit door immediately over something that trivial.   I never see anyone, however, consciously and sincerely seeking to be unloved, alienated, in pain, poor, homeless, starving, friendless, rejected by their families, or diseased.<br> <br>Being here, staying alive despite the slings and arrows, is the hard part for every person I&#39;ve ever talked with, and as a student of psychology, I have had many such conversations with a wide variety of people.  The temptation toward suicide has been strong in many of them, and nearly everyone considers it seriously more than once in their lives.<br>  <br>Perhaps in the few idyllic cultures where life wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t as psychologically grueling, people loved simply being alive so much they didn&#39;t want out of here.  But I live in modern America, and we have many worse things to deal with than death; and Americans by and large aren&#39;t in war zones, aren&#39;t in mass starvation and dehydration, as is happening with millions around the planet.  Do people really fear death these days?  Or do they fear more all the negative potential experiences of being alive?<br>  <br>I think it&#39;s time we stopped accepting the truism that death is the worst fear or the worst thing, although the people seeking to dominate humanity have always used the threat of death to manipulate us into doing what they want.  Death itself wasn&#39;t enough to stop people from standing up for their rights and wellbeing, so the psychopaths at the top had to add torture, horrible pain, and embarrassment to the death threat for it to be effective.  Gruesome deaths like crucifixion, burning alive, drawing and quartering, burying alive, stoning, and other tortured deaths all made a point because of the agony involved.
Without the exposure therapy I have got from your videos, parts of me would still be broken, and I would still be trying to fix myself all the wrong way. <br>Thank you.
What captured me in this speech is making a decision that turns out to be a bad idea. I would love to know more from Jordon on this topic. For myself I was an athlete competing in a sport with high possible risk to be injured. My goal was high, Olympics was my dream but while competing I had a fall leaving me a quadriplegic. Wow this has been a journey but I‚Äôm strong and stubborn and have lived many years post injury. Anyway you need confidential and most likely some arrogance to compete at a high level successfully and yes I did have the voice in my head that said things could go terribly wrong but to strive for the highest goal you learn to shut those voices out and believe in yourself. So now I live every day with incredible struggles both mind and body. Love Jordon to reach out and chat to me more on this dilemma. I‚Äôm thankful for all his advice and love his books !!

Was he referencing Howard Becker in the beginning? He only said Becker. Every time Dr. Peterson mentions a book or another intellectual I go and buy books by or about that person.
I have consistently felt a strong urge to pursue wisdom and authority to make a positive impact on humanity. I&#39;ve been actively searching for ways to gain influence and expand my understanding of the human race and uncover knowledge that isn&#39;t accessible to everyone.

Now i did think of using email/phonecall/letter to make it more personal, but as you helped me so much, i wanted to express my gratitude to you more publicly. <br>I hope this can been seen in right light.
Your words to someone in deep truama can seem extremely brutal but honest, so it&#39;s a good thing to hear and learn how to decipher them no matter the deep-seated truama one can become.<br>Many, many things you say are so right, but some I will openly admit I think can be a mistake in saying, but aren&#39;t we all succumb to that!<br>You said something in another video I saw the other day, and it came at the right time when I needed to hear it the most. About trust. Made me think about all i have learned in my recovery and after coming close to see what I have to do many times, I would see something that still triggered me so intensely,  it would make me forget what I needed to do.<br>I have held back from saying thank you to you as i wanted to wait until i felt it was the right time, and even though your words are hard to swallow,  I feel that time to show gratirude is now.<br>From the bottom of my heart, thank you so very much for your help in helping me get out of my truama.<br>Now time to get through these 3 months and suck it all up and hope I notice triggers before they flare up and make me.

Thoughts are in the air. They fly by all the time. If a thought goes by and I grab onto it. I become the thought. I can dismiss it. I mean that&#39;s the only way that happens. If I grab onto it. There it beats me up until I let it go. It&#39;s everyone else that doesn&#39;t deserve a beating? rp

Psychedelic trips are exactly the time to bring up haunting memories to examine them during the subconscious access portal being open.
I normally do not agree with reliving resentments. They are the death of people like myself...but to bring up the thoughts that plague me, from a solution perspective, maybe even discussing with a mentor I can rid myself of this anxiety problem.

Overcome negative thoughts and feelings? Huh. Thru divorce this can be accomplished.
He rambles and never pulls his desultory thoughts into a coherent whole, video after video.
It ought to be titled how to deal with Jordan Peterson. I get it because I&#39;m the same way, and I respect his work, but he can be insufferable.
He&#39;s the modern day Solomon
The timing is perfect for this. I was having a nice conversation with a woman on tinder. As more and more questions about me were asked by her I felt more and more depressed and miserable. I was having such a nice day too.
The only way for my misery to have been avoided, I would need a better father and peers growing up. My innocent self was killed off and is still my best friend. I cannot change the past or how people decided to treat me, but I can&#39;t let him (innocent self) down now. <br><br>One thing I would tell younger self, stay alone and you&#39;ll be better off, as I am now.
I was told before to seek help, but help just wanted to push pills and sessions that brought out worse emotions and thoughts. It got so bad that I attempted to take myself out of the picture.<br><br>I am now, unprofessionally, my own psychologist. I medicate myself with music and recreational herbs to keep a centered thought process and I&#39;ve cured myself of all fear and paranoia.<br>I save others from harming themselves by using their faith on them, even though I don&#39;t have a faith of my own. <br>I too have lingering thoughts of self attack but my goal is greater.

I was in the Marines for 8 years, and when i got out, I became depressed and weak. It made me livid when people mocked Dr. Peterson, when he cried on that interview, called him weak, babyish, and other ignorant terms. He wasn&#39;t crying over being made fun of like these weak, woke, creeps do; this man was crying over loss; like a person mourning. He is passionate about his work and a true warrior. This man saved my life.
I am responsible for my own demise!  Using Cains story really opened my eyes to my own self!  And thank you for that!  To understand now how, when, and why I  actually,  intentionally helped myself down the path that didn&#39;t take me to where I  would have actually gone and wanted to go, is so unbinding for me.  Lately I&#39;ve  pondered on questions about myself and you&#39;ve freed me from this mind ,ocked question.  Whew!  Amazing breakthrough...üòâüëç‚ù§

This has got to be one of his best explanations I have listened to yet... Negative thoughts &amp; past experiences breed anxiety , goals give you meaning and achieving them gives you satisfaction but that is fleeting - wow!
Negative thought and feelings are my motivation. I don&#39;t run from the truth or legit paranoia.
Thank you for the video.  I agree with you on conscious thoughts.  The realization and ability to recognize and determine the factuality of each individual thought, in my opinion, is what defines the truth.  Believing false realities, only sinks you deeper into an abyss where most individuals are.  <br><br>A strong mindset is able to determine the truth in any given statement.  Truth elevates all humans, especially with maturity, and it‚Äôs you‚Äôre choice with what you say and watch.
All of these things work fantastically when the problems can be solved. Issue arises when they cannot be. This is why there is a difference between true mental strength, that is pushing through horrific physical injury that will always cause pain, and these pathetic mental issues people claim to suffer from. Some people claim to know what depression is, many truly do not, or they are unwilling to carry themselves mentally out of it, on purpose, because they are lazy. That is why to some people who are maimed,  people like Greg Abbot, who is paralyzed, are hero&#39;s. Bruce McLaren, who was crippled in birth, also comes to mind.
These sound clips are an amalgamation of things he said. Putting them together doesn‚Äôt make any sense. As a matter of fact, they are very misleading. At least specify when his talks are from different times.
What about having revelations while on acid trip?
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg5eE0OdLr0&amp;t=12m45s"">12:45</a>, he says that Jesus had to admit the evil in himself to take on the sins of the world. No! Jesus was tempted, but had no sin nature. He is interpreting the gospel through the false lens of Jungian psychology. Shame on him.",PT15M21S
"Husbands, Fathers, Warriors & Kings | Senator Josh Hawley | EP 361","Take advantage of your 7 day free trial. All of Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+:  https://www.dailywire.com/trial/jordan

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Missouri senator Josh Hawley discuss his new book, ‚ÄúManhood,‚Äù and break down the importance and depth of the biblical ideals that have shaped society - and particularly the west - in a historically unprecedented manner. 

Josh Hawley is a constitutional lawyer, the U.S. Senator for Missouri, and the bestselling author of ‚ÄúThe Tyranny of Big Tech.‚Äù His newest publication, ‚ÄúManhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs,‚Äù is available now and seeks to defend the positive and necessary attributes of masculinity across leadership, governance, and the everyday structure of American life. Men of character are needed for a civilization to thrive, and today's America, the west, has openly sought to destroy the foundational and biblical principles that create them.

Ep.361",455618,14149,1839,2023-05-29T15:00:11Z,"These discussions have given me such a strong foundation that I had been missing as a product of a liberal upbringing. Ancient wisdom interpreted through the lens of modernity. Profound. It‚Äôs also worth noting the media has intentionally made a monster out of Senator Hawley but he is undeniable in long form like this. Thank you both for having the courage to lead us out of the hedonistic hell we were thrusted into before we were smart enough to realize. Truly grateful. God bless you both.
Tell us about his Chinese spy mistress
Gotta becareful that your definition of masculinity doesn&#39;t become &#39;negative traits people find in me that are unattractive&#39;. A lot of people confuse the very real disrespect in our culture towards strength and merit - to some kind of idea that everyone who has never liked you is because of these things.  Like no, there are men out there that are toxic, most of em. We know, the minority of us who are responsible for constantly drilling into their heads basic knowledge. Our idiot peers. We love &#39;em but they&#39;re stupid, what can you do? Besides than teach them and have patience.
Love Josh Harley, great that he represents conservatives‚ù§
The bible says wrong to say he is feminime and he must or should be a girl.
Wonderful conversation with much food for thought. My only complaint is that I wish I we could have heard more from Josh Hawley. Don&#39;t get me wrong; I love listening to Dr. Peterson. I just would have loved to hear more regarding Hawley, his faith, and his new book. <br>&quot;Pick a dragon of sufficient merit.&quot; - JP<br>This is a line I will remember forever.
Was this the man running out of the capital
I am a proponent of capitalism, but accept that it is a form of slavery.
I suppose the one positive out of the collapse of western civ is we have a front row seat to how societies unravel and what happens when Christianity is abandoned by a critical mass of persons. Like bankruptcy it happens slowly then all at once. The all at once will be civil war I presume.
European descent men CANNOT help the next generation without naming the Jew, the people to whom Jordan is not owned.
This is profound. I&#39;m amazed at just how easy it is to sit and listen to long form discussion.
Senator Hawley must have huge struggles at the end of many days after his discussions with people offering dishonest answers while on oath. He is one of only a few in Wash DC who is believable. God Bless him. ‚ù§
Jordan...we can&#39;t be or act good enough to enter into the presence of a Holy God,, not only that, but the wages of sin is death, the soul that sins, it shall die.  So God sent his only begotten son Jesus to take our sins upon himself and die the death for us so that Gods wrath against our sin is satisfied. Then, when His redemptive work on the cross was done He rose from the grave, conquering sin and death. When a person trust in this truth, believes it and repents or turns from sin to Jesus , God does an amazing transaction and gives us the righteousness of Jesus Christ.  So then, we can enter into His presence here and in eternity.....Though a man die, yet shall he live!  Do you believe this?  That&#39;s the question Jesus asked a woman named Martha in the Bible....check it out!
I&#39;ve been playing it almost daily, just to engage with every aspect they discussed because I noticed that at the first watch I was able to substantially follow the depths of their exchanges but I could pick that the foundations of purpose, responsibility and  manhood were being addressed addressed and thus i am encouraged to listen to it again and again
That Conjugation
If you think that rights are being removed from males, you should look at tge constraints I have as a 79 year old female xx chromosome, binary heterosexual with no money of my own to fight court cases of my rights to be heard to save our children. 8 years of fighting to have the right  the same Value as Jesus Christ.
Thanks for the reminders as men, more to do‚Ä¶. Peace on you gentlemen
This is awesome!!! Thank you so much for speaking on these topics!
Nah, I do not need burning bush and flying jesus to find meaning in life.<br><br>I am conservative and atheist.
Hawley the racist Maga maggot.
America was here 125 years before slavery
I was definitely red pilled, but Hawley is a danger to women‚Äôs rights
Thank you indeed! PHENOMENAL SPEAKING, and explanation, love these two professors!!!!!!! Braravissimi!!!!!!!üëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëã
did these jokers get some memo that wearing airpods with a green screened background of your living room makes you seem more relatable?
I said it first...üëâ JOSH HALEY .. for president one day...ü§î
As long as women live on their knees, men can be men!!  Damn someone has to be scarified, and women are the ones that always have!!.  So if men are Kings, what the hell are the female subjects of male Kings.  Let me guess, women just need to STFU.  As guess his wife and daughter have less worth and only need to say yes sir no sir.
Top shelf content as always- Senator Hawley is impressive.<br>(He should give his videographer a raise as well üòÇ).
Some points missing... JP needs to learn about the Spanish Crown and what they were building, no colony but really a solid empire with equality among all. Second is that they both forget the Kingship of Christ and why His Kingdom starts here on this life.
Another intriguing conversations! Also, amazing suit, as always!
Jordan Peterson has been attacking women in most of his videos.  If you have disdain for half of humanity do not expect to be taken seriously.  So, needless to say did not watch.
The call to responsibility is very good, but the only true answer to the search for meaning is reconciliation to God which can only come through accepting Jesus Christ as savior from our sins through his death on the cross
Very interesting guest and excellent dialogue!<br>Mr. Peterson, next time don‚Äôt interrupt your guest so much and just let him talk more!<br>Than you very much anyway üôè
Dr. Peterson, like some other great intellectual speakers, is held back only by his inner child‚Äôs longing for some sort of god/religious explanation for everything as a lynchpin for his anti-nihilistic approach. His, like others, only major argumentative flaw is that god/religion is not only completely illogical and preposterous and dangerous, but in fact not at all necessary for life to have ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù or purpose or a ‚Äúhigher power.‚Äù I  would be willing to bet that this is the last major area for personal growth that Peterson needs to address. Though, like almost all before and after him, he will probably die without ever really digging into it, because it‚Äôs just too painful and too much of his conceptual framework relies on it not being explored.
The opening is pure cringe. But Hawley is amazing. Watching him go after liars like a pitbull is like positive meditation, lol. Let&#39;s see if JP even allows him to speak. Would be a first for him.
He HAD to know he was going to get destroyed üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
Imagine Peterson trying to have a similarly deep conversation with b1den.
The lefts goal is to eradicate self empowerment and be dependent on the state.

I feel like Dr. Peterson really enjoys and is excited by having another man that can speak with him at his level of thought and knowledge.  Josh, you are as impressive as hell to keep up with Dr. Peterson.

Keep fighting for us and don&#39;t give up!! I appreciate you!!!!
I refuse to use pronouns to make them feel better about themselves, this is the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever heard!!
wow... closer m√ºssen nur lesen k√∂nnen - wie einfach doch diese Welt f√ºr diesen Herrn ist....üôÇ
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiijS_9hPkM&amp;t=8m46s"">8:46</a>... What an incredibly obnoxious comment.  I find this person repulsive; not for being trans, but for the personality/attitude.
Thank you Jordan Peterson !
stop!!! asking people o do what you think <br>if you&#39;re trans stay that way but stop insisting on your pronouns!!!!<br>You are all irritating
Peterson is always calm and collected when talking in heated debates and that goes a LONG way.   Very profession.
where has a &#39; normal people foob&#39; get the right to tell me which words i may use and when and where? I think i have the same rights to tell others what words they may use.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiijS_9hPkM&amp;t=9m25s"">9:25</a><br>Queerness is just a wrong thing. This is how is should be handled. Allowing this madness from the beginning is what led to what you hear here.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiijS_9hPkM&amp;t=2m27s"">2:27</a> What is this thing? This is insane.
Stop giving the narcissists attention.  Change the channel.  Gone.
I like the fact the Prof. Peterson remains calm throughout the interview. Thank you for standing up for free speech Dr. Peterson.
Ze zerr zaaa blah blah blah?? This is all very childish-I reject this culture and their ideologies god bless Mr. Peterson
It&#39;s not being lazy to use grammatically correct pronouns! It&#39;s ridiculous to have to learn the pronouns of every single person you come across.
My Pronouns:<br>Oo/Ee, Ooh/Ah ah, Ting/Tang, Walla/Wallah, Bing/Bang
Thank you Jordan Peterson! Many of us should learn to rise our voices or we will regret it. Political agenda is this of LGTB. And people now get offended by everything. If someone say their thinking many say is is hate peach. Comunication is being manipulated and twisted also. How about our kids, rising them without knowing their identity but being adoctrinated. NO we have to protect them.
Peet is obviously a narcissist. You have to be to bully over 90% of the population into submission. I really admire Peterson&#39;s courage and integrity!
Warning global warming denier online avoid.
so ... we&#39;ll be changing the name of the orient express? will Agatha Christie&#39;s movie murder on the orient express now be banned? what about the expression &#39;mystery of the orient&#39;?  <br>ppl get offended. they get over it. it&#39;s not as if one wakes up with leprosy bc they felt offended.<br>common courtesy needs a new language? no, it doesn&#39;t.  it&#39;s one thing to KINDly inform a person what you prefer.  making common courtesy law is absurd. why not be more interested and caring in removing laws already on the books that hurt us all or that are ridiculous?  still laws on the books like sodomy, illegal. fkng a horse, illegal. adultery, illegal. why insist on adding to the giant cornucopia of bs when this is prime opportunity to clean up the arbitrary dookey?<br>i will speak as i choose. period. if you DECIDE to be offended, that&#39;s your choice.
Agree with paterson!
Let‚Äôs stop catering to their insanity.
Po
So ok, I‚Äôm kind of in the middle here.<br><br>I just have one question, let‚Äôs imagine we are willing to use these new ‚Äúpronouns‚Äù.<br><br>If I see a person I don‚Äôt know, how should I approach them? Hir, them?<br><br>If the person is transgender, what should I say? <br><br>It‚Äôs complicated honestly, I think the best thing to do is to completely avoid pronouns as much as you can. <br><br>:)
This is a 10-8 round. Peterson
Bottom line is that whether you support or against LGBTQ , the common ground where both should meet is logic , unless everyone understood the logic of why someone else is this way , he/ she will remain ignorant
Lunatics running the asylum?
We need protection.  Strait normal people are the ones under attack
They think they are too privileged to make us remember rheir own pronoun
Jordan Peterson is a legend, he talks sense and speaks truthfully, the man has integrity. Peet is delusional.
JP is like a light in a dark dark world
Lmfao I knew that girl in a tie was a female lol bruh
It&#39;s worrisome where the world is getting ...
the little skinny guy with the glasses,is a wanker, that is the pronoun i give him
How are you trans and non binary. I‚Äôm so confused
Jordan is absolutely right
This is from six years ago are there still just 31 gender pronouns or has that number maybe doubled by now?
The problem is the guy that claims people who speak freely are not nice! Peace and Justice is only for those deviant perverse ones who demand how others must speak!
The left side is often very violent when they hear the truth!
And here we are , 6 years later seeing this craziness getting to astronomic levels. <br>Thanks JP for being such fortress !
Peterson doing God&#39;s work!
If someone corrects you on their pronouns, it&#39;s easy enough to adapt and use them.
All this lgbtqoprstuwxyz + - * / is like playing house as a child...but it&#39;s still just a game, pretending, in this case a sick, twisted imagination.<br>[ ! - N O - ! ] : For WOKE, LGBTQ+, PRIDE MONTH, HURT FEELINGS SNOWFLAKES, 5ISS!E5, FEMINISTS, KARENS, BODY POSITIVITY MOVEMENT, EVERYTHING LEFTISM KIND OF! : [ ! - N O - ! ]
Jordan Peterson calls it the way it is, not the way somebody wants to change the way it is.
I‚Äôll never use pronouns
Trans people are lying
I‚Äôm offended being called sis
wtf....thats about it. male-female, theres is nothing more then this....period
This is bullshit! How many pronouns do we need to learn to accommodate ppl who chose to be out of the norm!
He or she , that&#39;s all.

"Jordan Peterson - The Keys to Growth, Emotional Resilience, & Finding Purpose | Modern Wisdom 436","Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and an author.

Letting go of the good for the great is a terrifying prospect and most people fear risking what they have for what they want. I flew out to Texas to sit down with Jordan and discuss his principles for how to get past the things which keep us stuck in life.

Expect to learn how to deal with feelings of loneliness from thinking in a different way, which skin-colour emoji Jordan Peterson uses, what he meant by ""enforced monogamy"", how to deal with imposter syndrome, how to become more dangerous in life, Jordan's thoughts after meeting Elon Musk, whether there's a value in having an enemy in life and much more...

I love listening to intelligent people talk.
I struggle with the Zero-Sum Game mentality and this is the first ive ever watched Jordan Peterson and first ive heard of that terminology. Ive always had a fixation that we all cant be CEO and entreprenuers and trailblazers. Like if everyone is a producer there can be no more consumers. That some of us need to fall in line and do the grunt work for the cogs of humanity can continue turning. Is this even an example of Zero-Sum? Is this a wrong outlook? Or is it only wrong if you are sacrificing your potential to remain a low level cog?
Funny to see Jordan Peterson misinterpret Club of Rome ...
Informative
Well, I&#39;m shutting this down after five minutes.  Elon is no more of an honest player than you, Jordan.  You&#39;re both in bed with traitors to our country because you want the market, you want the audience.   Both of you saying things that are really kind of dumb.  But yeah as far as a Bill Gate or an Elon Musk or a Steve Jobs, coming by their wealth in a honest, hard-working fashion, with no human distain or trickery involved, it doesn&#39;t happen.  Elon, I believe, in the early days, had nothing for himself, just an empty hand, but bluffed two independent business relationships into thinking he, Elon, actually possessed what he had borrowed from the other.  You kind of have to look down your nose at the people you&#39;re dealing with to accomplish such a thing.   Even today, I bet an Elon or a Gates has no problem wielding an inconsistent ideology.  If they get what they want by doing it.  Sit one down sometime.  See if they make sense.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;m in the minority--never wanted to have my own children. My career has been fulfilling; I am a creative introvert, so I enjoy being alone and doing my artistic and intellectual hobbies. When I was almost 40, I got married to a man who already had two children, and I tried to be the best stepmother I could be. We got a divorce after 16 years together. Now I am 60 and I have a strong nonprofit mission along with my career. I don&#39;t feel that I am missing out on anything. Finally, my life is peaceful and I can do what I always wanted to do.
weird noise gate on the audio just let it rip
Jordan Peterson I so love you for your wonderful brain and elegance. Be Well.
I&#39;m still watching, but how can you have a 2 hour talk and not offer your guest a drink. Table is empty, do they hold a break during filming? Seems the only thing reasonable to do, but that would break the flow of the conversation
Sometimes I wonder if this is all a modern attack on women. The Satanic stuff from the 80&#39;s might have been a thing that was used to misdirect and blame really creepy stuff the elites were doing on innocent middle aged women who are the least threatening class of adult humans in the world, just as he said the young female accusers of the women ultimately put to death as witches... aging women are considered gratuitous and useless.

Its the continual quest that we all must undertake, to the eternal mother who is a kind of villain, and its this ancestral wisdom that we have to voluntarily undertake, but it can be quite frightening when we&#39;re confronted with the answers our soul brings to bear, alot of men never recover, but to rise to level of diety is the only answer. Thats what the prophets said. These are the questions we have to ask ourselves when we&#39;re in line at the supermarket. No one can do it for us. Its a serious matter man. Its nothing to laugh at. The knowledge of one&#39;s self, while knowing full well that this knowledge might be fruitless. But also quite promising. We have to confront these things, head on!  Its not for the faint of heart.

Not sure I would get why we would need more people. With AI around the corner, there wont be any jobs for young people anyway.<br><br>Fewer people who are smarter and live longer and can innovate longer is the way forward. We dont need any more (stupid) people. Those are the one who are either woke or trumptards.
&quot;I love my sister, I love my wife, I have a daughter, I love my mother&quot;  freudian slip?

8 Billion people are competing for resources which equals food and energy and this negativity impacts  animal and insects habitat. Refugees and uneven opportunities for 8 billion people creates envy and war.
As a a highly sensitive visual person it is a joy to see Jordon fingers dance with his words such a visceral impact to his audience.

Why don‚Äôt we have people like Jordan Peterson in politics.? It would be a much more better world. Discipline is indispensable for responsible peaplle.
That denoiser is really distracting üòÆ
all this women empowerment comes from years of suppression and oppression. In that context, men did not do a great job! he should have given the space for her, which dint happen!! women create families and if we are crying out on the current situation, its an outcome of the past incidents!
well, it means men has to step up and take effort to upgrade to higher standards. women refraining from getting to competence hierarchy is not the solution. when you outgrow older version of yourself through exposures, you will not get what you wanted fundamentally in your older version, thats how it is.. but that does not mean you stop growing

I am that woman who chose never to have kids. I am one of those rare exceptions. Nearing 50 and looking back, I have no regrets. As a young pre-teen I wanted to experience life outside of motherhood. Being a mom never seemed interesting to me. I have my child/free friendships. I‚Äôm travel the world. Life is fine. You will be ok if you choose to have no kids. Do find love. I have that with my partner and that is enough for me.
I always hear conservatives speaking about women refusing to have children, but I find that the challenge to find men that will make good fathers is a lot of what inspires this.

thanks professor Jorden, this man got me out of my darkest times 4 years ago, and now my life is therefore put back together,  when I look back, this man has been the closest figure to a father, fueling me with encouragement and explanation.
50% less of people walking would have been great, just sayin.
Quisiera que estuviera en espa√±ol.
Wow this is just so amazing. I&#39;m a forensic Peer Specialist. I was given a psychological report where in a round about way this man deemed me unlikely to obtain sobriety. I was told I had board line personality traits and reckless decision making with no regard to authority. I now have 4 years clean off of hard drugs and less than a year for alcohol. I work in the mental health field now and it&#39;s amazing and so fascinating. Just by listening to you I feel like my mind is being expanded. Thank you for sharing your content. Thank you heavily Father üôè for this man&#39;s understanding and ability to teach . Blessings and Favor I pray for you Amen .
I know you know but trust me they destroyed you ...

Thank you Jordan Peterson for being an inspiration and an awakening to logic and reason
I had to live it, it&#39;s unbelievable !
I&#39;ve never seen so many beautiful comments on social media. This man inspires us to be hopeful and kind and just better. He goes through so much but keeps going. Thank you. Thank you. ‚ù§
Jordan Peterson is a blessing to many. I achieved success after I practiced the steps below.
I will listen to this video every single day until the changes truly take root
Never forget the peice Dr. Peterson paid and conrinues to pay and that he chooses to pay it, because he believes in us all.<br><br> If any man is to be celebrated, loved and help up in the light for others to see, Dr. Peterson is that man.<br><br>Thank you Jordan Peterson. ‚ù§
IMy dream has become to be able to attend one or more (prefer more) lectures by Jordan Petterson! <br>People matter. I am just at the beginning, but the profound reasons treating yourself &amp; others like they <b>matter.</b> WOW!! my question then is: Why then are PTSD/Autism therapists, or at least all the ones I have seen with the exception of 2,  telling me &amp; others the &quot;most healing Mantra ever&quot; I/we should say to ourselves multiple times a day is, &quot;I don&#39;t matter. I have never mattered. I will never matter. It is impossible for me to ever matter.&quot;????
Just landed a new job that&#39;s much better,  today after dealing with a pathological work environment for 8 years.... ty jordan peterson sometimes all you need is encouragement.
Truth is truth. Thank you for this.

Truth or dare? Funny game right?.. because i can always choose truth and lie.. without giving them a clue?.. only the one with knowledge of what&#39;s whithin their hearts knows.. am i wrong?
Modern day prophet.
I can see this man changing the mind of the elite
Does anyone know where I can find the whole interview shown in the intro of this video?
Being an empath and share authentic information, massive shift
Jordan &quot;Rat&quot; Peterson: &quot;My message to the Hungarians. Do not rebel against your prime minister! Your prime minister is trying to restore the metaphysical foundation of the Hungarian culture&quot;<br>Another crazy guest of F≈±rer Orban in the Nazi eagle nest, Father Jim Blount from the USA: &quot;I would like to tell you a secret about Jesus and a secret about your prime minister.

Jordan Peterson is a beautiful man!
Mr Peterson...... If you see this ...<br><br>We need to talk
Peterson Described me in a nutshell. I&#39;m evil. And I never mattered. I am alone. Society treated me like shit. And I really dont give a fuck. No one would give a fuck,  they busy doing them.
Sane thinkers in a distressed world trying to talk to a money-driven mind curer Jew (read: DIVISIVE, ALWAYS). The hilarity....these guys/gals ALREADY KNOW the sickness of their society, but out of politeness think it might be a shortcoming or illness of themselves.<br>WRONG! This current world IS FUCKED, until sane people fix it.
Sharing good news in your life might make you a target for the hater-type.<br>Crabs in a barrel principle.....here.<br>Who are your true friends?<br>I can&#39;t answer that for you, but, take a non-pussy dose (5+ grams, dried) of magic mushrooms and see the world as it really IS.
&quot;children are crazy little creatures and they need to be civilized&quot; that is pure goldüòÇ
It‚Äôs a blessing to Still Have You Here Brother. Keep Pushing üôèüèº
What a shill
JP gave me hope in the most simple way that nobody else possibly could and it&#39;s crazy how this common knowledge isn&#39;t so common anymore.<br><br>One of those things in particular is the part about how your life might be in absolute catastrophe, but you can reduce the severity of the suffering involved by just making sure your day ends better than it began.<br><br>Rinse and repeat, after some struggle and a bit of time, you&#39;ll end up far better off later down the line.<br><br>That helps immeasurably. So many people have issues and they stress themselves almost to death because they can&#39;t make them dissapear overnight.<br><br>But just that tiny bit of hope that things can incrementally improve until it&#39;s substantial is life changing.
Truth and JP in the same headline. Uh oh, mulligan bros have just declined.<br><br>Jordan Peterson is a complete fool. He believes in the stupid lie of life called the Bible. Humans would be better off with out the Bible and JP.<br><br>God is a made up word.<br><br>We evolved.<br><br>Grow up.
So you&#39;re saying all lives matter?  Hmmm...
I just heard JP say success is very unlikely. Why would I even try striving for something that&#39;s very unlikely to happen Jordan Peterson?
I wonder am I the only person that listens to JP and get lost in the message he&#39;s giving? I&#39;ll see the title to his video and think this ought to be helpful and end up not finishing it because what&#39;s he&#39;s talking about vaguely relates to the title. If the title says 5 principles of success, I&#39;m looking for 5 principles of success in numerical order, not what somebody said to you after one of your lectures.
He&#39;s a full-blown <b>EMPATH.</b>  Can&#39;t you feel him?
Is he on the spectrum ?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFnKQF6R6yQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFnKQF6R6yQ</a>     You are entering the Light Jordan.   On your side  - holding your heart.  You suffer so much.   Heartbreaking.  But the Light of God will flood you.
I love this!!!!!!
how can anybody hate this man

His concern is not for all, only for the &#39;able&#39;, what about the forgotten? His audience is entirely entitled definition of &#39;white ppl problems&#39;. I love so many of his ideas and intellectual content, but he&#39;s only out to reach &#39;worthy ppl&#39; as he&#39;s NOT directing a message to the dregs of society that need his brilliance the most. Imagine if he cared about the truly poor, and horribly neglected, abused, slipped through the cracks ppl in society? How about homeless ppl? oh no- privileged ppl who &#39;feel&#39; they can&#39;t measure up&#39; bc of silly peer pressure vs ppl under actual life threatening danger to jump through every hoop and go through every nightmarish city transit and dangerous neighborhoods to get to his lectures that are only airmed at ppl who actually, regardless of ability or intellect, can in a societal way have upward movement. This helps only the top tier or society. Impress me by getting this msg and help through to the ppl who actually need it. Sorry middle upper class but you do not deserve more than a chance at survival. Pandering to the middle class vs actually helping the ppl that need it to survive would earn respect. Just seems like a lot of ass kissing for ppl who already are guaranteed easy survival and a life of true suffering rather than directing attention to the ppl who can&#39;t boost his ego due to addiction, homelessness, abuse, etc. Only certain ppl deserve help? Ah, only ppl with the luxury of having the tech to pander to this man.
You only offer help to ppl with such an educational background that they have the LUXURY of being bereft about imaginary issues, whilst not going out to help the ppl who have actual survival issues. It appears you&#39;re all about progressing ppl with no obvious abilities past IMAGINARY trivial made up suffering whilst ignoring uneducated, marginalized individuals that have zero, truly zero access to any forward or upward movement in society or in their way of life bc they have to beg, borrow, steal, walk days for ounces of water- how much are you HELPING, when your audience is already spoiled privileged brats with &#39;credibility&#39; that can&#39;t function or progress bc they have been spoiled or overly cared for? I have a hard time feeling sympathy for poor Timmy who is so babied and protected his whole life and later in life is anxious specifically bc he was unprepared but not bc he legitmately was deprived of a childhood lacking constant abuse. Not to be dismissive but boo hoo your feelings weren&#39;t recognized with your achievements at university whilst ppl whose potential was so stifled from childhood that they will only end up in prison. Why help the ppl who will still have a home and retirement with their &#39;problems&#39; vs the ppl who can barely survive. As a self declared world wide phenom with the solutions to all mankinds psychological issues-you only offer treatment to the upper class . I see NOTHING offered to the meth addicts, the crack addicts, the alcoholics, the ppl so broken.... your HELP is only for the ppl deamed worthy of becomming something vs just anyone who can use some comfort or help to improve. You only seem to want to &#39;help&#39; ppl with the potential to BE somebody. VS just ppl who deserve to exist by your standards.

Black people were never chimps, just saying
Although you ARE &quot;compelled&quot; by your innate interest in something, you CAN &quot;make yourself interested in something&quot;! You do it by TEACHING YOURSELF a little about it... then, you MIGHT BECOME INTERESTED in the subject! This is how it CAN WORK with any intelligent, INQUISITIVE person! (If you&#39;re not intelligent and inquisitive, this might NOT work.) [Alexondra&#39;s mom, Gabi]
This is A&#39;s MOTHER : <br><br>Kale can be COOKED &amp; is delicious! Don&#39;t forget about  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23turnipgreens"">#TurnipGreens</a>, also delicious when cooked and excellent against hyper-ACIDITY in your stomach. <br><br>I CURED myself of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ulcers"">#ULCERS</a> for which I took meds every 12 hours for 16 YEARS!!! I ATE TURNIP GREENS constantly - my body  CRAVED THEM!... which is how I discovered them! My body literally TOOK ME TO THEM in the supermarket and TOLD ME &quot;I WANT THIS!!!&quot;... so much so that I bought a HUGE BUNCH OF THEM!<br><br> I also DRANK THE JUICE - the water in which I cooked the TURNIP GREENS.  Once you TRY them and SEE how much BETTER your STOMACH FEELS, you&#39;ll WANT MORE. (It WORKED so MUCH BETTER than the medication I was taking, and STILL suffering with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gurd"">#gurd</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23acidreflux"">#AcidReflux</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ulcerpain"">#UlcerPain</a>, etc!!!) I literally couldn&#39;t get enough of them. And, my ulcers were GONE IN 2.5 MONTHS of eating TURNIP GREENS and drinking the juice. You can also try <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mustardgreens"">#MustardGreens</a> for variety. (They&#39;re a little &quot;hot.&quot;) You can get all of these greens (that I and the show mentioned) at local SUPERMARKETS, no specialty stores needed. Best of luck (you WON&#39;T need it) and God bless you.
The man on this cover has OVER 100 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23growths"">#GROWTHS</a> on his face(!!!)... and you&#39;re going to take serious  LIFE LESSONS/ADVICE from HIM?!?

The conclusion of that concept is not included in this video and I feel like it could be helpful for me due to the relateability that I found in that snippet. Any help would be appreciated!!
I hope you will also look into &quot;a brief look at Jordan Peterson&quot;, a comparably short video with spot-on analysis!
Life is not that simple, if it was, we&#39;d have one emotional system.
I wish I could&#39;ve found him sooner in life, abandonment has left me a man child and now I&#39;m paying for it. But it&#39;s never too late to love yourself and stop the self destruction.

This man is so articulate.. he has a lot of depth in his thoughts that he flawlessly knows how to express it
I love listening to this guy I wholeheartedly think he&#39;s the most logical person I&#39;ve ever heard speak words. I wish I could take the advice in my real life but people are so hard to change and I feel like my own worst enemy all the time. I&#39;m a great supporter of being honest although I can&#39;t be genuinely honest about everything no one can truly and still have relationships with people little white lies are ok I hope like telling someone there haircut looks nice although you don&#39;t feel that way? Can anyone answer this for me. I&#39;ve never lied to my husband about mostly everything especially fidelity but recently learned we are not on the same wavelength I thought we were and it&#39;s so hard for me to get through how do I get through this

I have a long way to go, because I do not see any healthy people young or old, near or far. Everyone looks gray, overweight, grumpy and sad. The amount of handicap license plates are unreal. Every store I pull up to has more handicap spots than regular spots. We can exercise our butts off, all the while pharma, healthcare and food industries are trying their hardest to poison everyone. It&#39;s just hard to stay positive when sickness surrounds us.
Such an amazing talk! It‚Äôs practical and actionable. Worth watching multiple times!
The only marker that used to be based on age was blood pressure. They don&#39;t do that anymore because they recignised that BP rising with age is not a good thing.
Eating to excess is killing people. Look around. Obese people are everywhere. Too much food is killing people.
How did I miss this?
This guy sounds better on a set of bluetooth buds than most podcasters do with thousands of dollars worth of microphone setups.
Excuse me, but according to most online sources there is   nearly ten teaspoons of sugar in 8 to 12 oz. of Coca Cola as opposed to 2 liters. Recent research has shown that sugar causes inflammation. It is not safe to consume in any quantity.
I know men who are unhealthy and fat and have a tremendous grip strength but zero cardio. How would grip strength be a key marker for longevity?
No.  Your argument would also be dissipated in the simple realization that &quot;life is killing you&quot;--particularly if you are &quot;living&quot; in fear.  A better discussion would be why corporations use absolute garbage to feed the &quot;human livestock&quot;.  But then fear gets clicks.
When I had a dog I would go into the woods and exercise him ( he was a GSD high drive and high maintenance). Now I don‚Äôt have the dog and I am not exercising for my own health. Interesting how my dog‚Äôs health was so important to me that I forgot I also exist. His training, exercise and diet was the pinnacle of my life.
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-vZMmoZ2SI&amp;t=49m57s"">49:57</a> I&#39;d add that the obesity epidemic made the COVID pandemic look like <b>something</b> as opposed to nothing. COVID wouldn&#39;t have been nearly as big a deal without the prevalence of comorbidities associated with obesity.
Interesting discussion but going nowhere in terms of real solutions. Dr Attia may benefit from intense study of Patanjali‚Äôs Yoga Sutras as the life design manual. Everything and every concern expressed here has been studied in deep by the ancients and codified. How hard is that to just evaluate and adapt to the present circumstances? Well one hopes in the midst of widespread despair on the state of individuals and the collective world.

Peterson delved into juvenile arhtritis for....... 2 yours!!!! üòÄ
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-vZMmoZ2SI&amp;t=29m08s"">29:08</a> Astounded that the medical community would do that. I remember in the 90s when i would shop for a dress for my wife. the dress sizes seemed to be going down even though she remained the same size. i assumed that the fashion industry was compensating for womens bodies becoming larger as they aged or something of that nature. By early 2000s my wife had gone from a size 6 down to size 00. Yet her weight and body composition remained the same.
I remember when I saw Dr Attia&#39;s ted talk: What if we&#39;re wrong about diabetes? I have no words to describe it....... A prime example of a proper scientist and especially of a proper human being.
Obviously exercise is great for everyone but diet is the real key.  Stop eating processed food.
I live in Japan, and was here during the pandemic. Many people aren&#39;t aware that Japan suffered no excess deaths during the pandemic, surprisingly, the number of deaths actually fell in 2020, compared to previous years. Doctors had predicted that at least 250,000 elderly Japanese would die from COVID, but this never happened. The main reason is that Japanese people are fundamentally healthy, that obesity and diabetes are rare in Japan. Many people will attribute this to the Japanese diet, but living in Japan, I can tell you that Japanese are not careful about what they eat. Japanese eat more salt than any nationality, they eat lots of junk food and and sugar, eat fish which contains high levels of mercury, and lots of Japanese smoke and drink alcohol. Yet Japan has the longest-living population in the world. The secret is physical activity, mainly walking and stairs. Your typical work commute to Japan involves a walk to the nearest train or subway station, many parts of Japan, including Tokyo itself, are not &quot;accessible,&quot; that is, have elevators or escalators, so you need to climb stairs. If you are in the countryside, getting to a train platform may require 4 flights of stairs. Most housewives do their commuting to stores, schools, and such on foot or by bicycle. Japanese pantries and refrigerators are not large, so a trip to the grocery store is something done at least every other day.  My daily commute consisted of leaving my 3rd floor apartment, descending 3 flights of stairs, a 2 km walk to the train station, and climb a long flight of stairs to the train platform. Then  it was a 30 minute, standing-room-only ride to Tokyo station, climb down another flight of stairs, a 15 minute walk to my 4th floor office, which had no elevator. I didn&#39;t need to go to a gym to stay fit.

dr peter attia is a real jam
It is unbelievable how much study we need to make to realize that not being obese and exercising makes us to live longer...
I‚Äôve been pushing these ideas for over 25 years working in the fitness industry. Not much has changed, just our understanding of why and how, and how much. People who are regularly active have had better overall life quality and quantity, this has been known at least anecdotally for a very long time
I would like to thank you two for sharing this valuable information and advice, we got it for next to nothing, at least, for those of us who have eyes to see and ears to hear. So you can consider me your charity work (ha ha). Food truly is more than substance. It is a very social thing also. I have lost friends &amp; Family because of the way I choose to eat . I thought you might find this interesting. The US Army has a manual entitled, ‚Äú Escape &amp; Evasion‚Äù, it talked about the psychological reasons why soldiers surrender to their enemy. The survey said that 80% of the time soldiers surrendered was because they ‚Äú thought‚Äù  they would run out of food or ammunition. So, let‚Äôs not let our stomachs rule over us !
Indeed!  Prevention is cheaper then the cure!
JBP needs to prove with his lab values/colonoscopy results etc‚Ä¶besides feeling good.
Low-carb, high-animal-protein diets promote heart disease via mechanisms other than just their effects on cholesterol levels. Arterial blockages may be caused by animal-protein-induced elevations in free fatty acids and insulin levels and decreased production of endothelial progenitor cells (which help keep arteries clean). Egg yolks and red meat appear to significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease and cancer due to increased production of trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, a metabolite of meat and egg yolks linked to the clogging of arteries. (Egg whites have neither cholesterol nor TMAO.)‚Äù
The negative long-term consequences of ketogenic diets may far outweigh any potential short-term benefits, according to a comprehensive new review published in Frontiers in Nutrition.<br><br>Keto diets have skyrocketed in popularity over the last decade due to their ability to promote quick weight loss. Typically very low in carbohydrates, modest in protein, and high in fats, the aim of keto diets is to push the body into ketosis‚Äîthe state in which the body uses fat for fuel. Foods like red meat, fish, nuts, cream, eggs, cheese, oil, and non-starchy vegetables are given the green light while starchy vegetables, fruit, whole grains, beans, and lentils are avoided as much as possible.
I am on the Whole Foods plant-based lifestyle/diet (Dr Joel Fuhrman) for over 2 years‚Ä¶..I am living proof to daily high energy and my lab values are all in optimal range.  I am told by by doctors that I will have longevity.  My goal is simply to keep hospitalizations and prison nursing home at bay.
There are Eskimos living exclusively on meat, (dear, seals, fish, ...), and really fat meat at that, so nothing surprising to the fact that humans can survive eating only meat.<br>Maybe there is a random mutation (or Eskimo ancestors) that could explain why some people do very well on a similar diet. Did anyone explore that possibility ?
Cancer can not thrive or survive within an Alkaline Environment
Keto Breath is another issue. The foundation of any diet is proper cellular hydration &amp; mineralization.
Sigma males like myself don&#39;t have a nested social network by definition and do just fine....just sayin&#39;

The loss of muscle mass &amp; explosive strength is attributed to not getting enough healthy protein daily
Cellular Dehydration + Minerals Deficiencies= Inflammation<br><br>Should be added to it....<br><br>The body is made up of 70-80% Water... &amp; THIS is often overlooked.<br><br>Note: Water is Not Just Water<br><br>Water with a naturally occurring ORP of a -300 to -450 &amp;  pH of 8.5 &amp; Up is what the body really needs. Microclustered - Ionic Living Water... <br><br>1/2 of The Body&#39;s Weight in fl oz should be consumed Daily.<br><br>~Timon Brown~<br>Certified Hydration Specialist
I love this discussion and would like to know his thoughts on women in menopause. Hormones affects on the body.
This dynamic here is wise uncle talking to his insanely smart nephew
I think that adding habits is difficult because what cements a new habit is when it is integrated into daily routine. I needed to increase my exercise, namely high intensity interval training, increase my cardiovascular health, while not adding unsupported habits. The solution was a bicycle as a mode of commuting. By changing my lifestyle to one of a cyclist I now am on no meds, great Bp, I get my exercise while reducing my budget by a car with all the licenses and payments. I now lead a minimalist lifestyle and the  works well with a carnivore diet. It does make me very unrelatable to women but I am not sure that is a bad thing, especially today&#39;s women....

Lekkere vertaler ook, dochter had artritis in 40 gewrichten‚Ä¶.RTL maakt er 4 vanü´£
viel het jullie ook op dat in de ondertiteling miste, dat kinderen ook moeten leren onafhankelijk te kunnen leven?
Vreemd dat ze op de UVA zo moeilijk deden over zijn bezoek. Je zou van hoog opgeleiden toch verwachten dat ze beter weten, maar helaas.
Heb het boek gelezen erg mooi boek
Goede focus in dit interview; geeft een goed beeld van de man achter het boek.
Heerlijk deze man.
Ik vindt het heel grappig dat het filmpje in het Engels is, maar bijna iedereen hier spreekt Nederlands.
Heb je  dr.Jordan Peterson als Gast en ga je iemand met zoveel kennis over wat wereldwijd werkelijk aan de hand is en ga je hem dit soort vragen stellen? Weer een voorbeeld hoe diep het media virus geworteld zit naar mijn mening.
Briljante denker en spreker. Of je nu wel of niet eens bent met de posities over controversi√´le onderwerpen.
Die zou nu niet meer uitgenodigd worden....RTL is nu veels te &quot;woke&quot; geworden...
Jordan Peterson is een van de weinige stemmen van gezond verstand die we nog over hebben! En ik zeg dit als vrouw die heel erg veel geeft om de rechten en het welzijn van andere vrouwen!
Hoe in de naam &#39;of everything thats holy&#39; kan deze man als controversieel gezien worden? Anders dan door een groep militante drammers die de wereld op bijna fascistische wijze hun &#39;levenswijze&#39; met dwang en zelfs geweld willen opleggen. En het lukt ze nog ook! Waar zijn we mee bezig!
Jeetje geeft de man ook even de ruimte om rustig te antwoorden dan elke keer te graag door willen vragen echt irritant.
Hahaha wereld van verschil aan tafel.
Zou ik ook net een kind lijken als ik naast Peterson zit?
Jammer dan hij geinterviewd wordt door iemand die hem amper kan volgen.
Extreem slimme man , <br>Eerlijk en super bespraakt..<br>Komt hier in deze talkshow totaal niet tot zijn recht en dat is jammer ‚Ä¶<br><br>Beetje hetzelfde als ronaldo uitnodigen op een open dag fumo kleien
Ziekte betekent: do you understand musik?
Kan niemand bij RTL een non-oppervlakkige vraag stellen..
Petersons visie op het leven is net als een moslim.<br>zijn ideologie verschilt niet veel met de Islam.<br>ironisch zijn veel van zijn hardcore fans anti Islam en anti moslim, terwijl ze deze man en zijn visie en ideologie steunen.
Die tatas proberen de Engelse taal zo accentloos mogelijk te spreken ‚Ä¶waarom dan .<br>Spreek hem gewoon als een vreemde taal want dat is die taal nou eenmaal in nl.<br>Dutch is de Nederlandse taal en niet Engels.<br>Wees gewoon je zelf een keertje ipv een lik hondje van Amerika ‚Ä¶(en ja hij komt niet uit VS )
Overrated
De EU, en al helemaal Den Haag, zou deze man eens serieus om advies moeten gaan vragen!!!
Jordan Peterson, geweldige baas. Zijn Podcasts bij Joe Rogan zijn ook absoluut het luisteren waard.
Dr Peterson is een redelijke stem in onredelijke tijden. Hij heeft het leven van duizenden jonge mannen geholpen.
Deze man heeft zoveel wijsheid daar kan de hele regering en woke groepjes nog wat van leren.
Deze man is een verademing. Nederland kan hem goed gebruiken. Nodig hem vooral uit bij woke-thema&#39;s. Verhelderend en het geeft je als Nederlander weer het gevoel dat je mag doen en denken wat je wil en dat focussen op excessen eigenlijk heel irrationeel en unfair is.
Saaie oppervlakkige vragen aan iemand die onwijs veel te vertellen heeft met veel kennis en diepgang. Toch blij dat hij op TV heeft mogen komen.
Jordan Peterson is een extreem rechtse nep intellectueel!
Wat is de ondertiteling slecht zeg
.No one can change sex and a bird that makes dog noises still doesn&#39;t make it a dog!<br>Pseudologia phantastica is a disease where people believe in their lies, suffer from delusions or pseudologia phantastica. These people have lost their grip on reality and lie so much that in the end they themselves no longer know what is a lie and what is not.<br>A man remains a man and a woman remains a woman. May God guide them and this is a heinous act by The Creator.<br>However, these mentally ill people should be left alone, meaning that they should not be called names
Echt een bijzondere man. Een van de meest intelligente mensen die ik heb gezien
Atheist rob banks and kill people.<br><br>Zo&#39;n amerikaanse zealot heb je al helemaal niks aan. Hij verkoopt amerika de Koch Broers agenda. Opdonderen met die oplichter, rijkelui agenda en dat religieuze mafketel gedoe.<br><br>Peterson is ook zo&#39;n mafketel die wil bepalen hoe we moeten leven in de samenleving met zijn conservatieve bullshit. De man moet dit, de vrouw moet dat. Atheisten zijn slecht ( iedereen moet geloven in sprookjes ). <br><br>Loonslaaf moet zijn uitbuiting en armoede accepteren want alles is eigen schuld, en de 1% is ook wel zo succesvol en hebben zo hard gewerkt ! ( NOT ). Liegen is die dus ook niet vies van ! De waarheid vertellen is hij niet zo goed in.<br><br>En zo kan ik nog even doorgaan. Heb dat ventje een hele tijd tot op de voet gevolgd en de onzin en leugens vlogen tegen de muur.<br><br>Eerst klagen over zachte mannen en hoe zielig ze zijn, en daarna gaan janken als een baby met traantjes op Youtube om Jesus christus die nooit bestaan heeft als een vieze gevoelige simp ! Jankie jankie jank ! Beta male kneusje is het ! Altijd een ander beschuldigen van het gene wat hij zelf ook doet.<br><br>En dan hebben we het nog niet gehad over zijn medicijn gebruik waarbij die bijna om het leven kwam. Anderen vertellen dat ze harder moeten worden in het leven, leren omgaan met tegenslagen en zelf is het een mietje die niks kan hebben. Een miljonair die de gewone man die het echt moeilijk heeft vertellen dat ze de harder moeten worden. En zelf kan die met al zijn privileges niks verwerken en raakt die psychishe in de shit ! En grijpt naar medicijnen die hij anderen afraad. HAHA zachte heelmeesters maken stinkende wonden.ü§£Kan zelf niks waar maken. ü§£ Het is gewoon een vieze kwakzalver die geld verdient door boeken te verkopen aan zijn domme volgers die niet zelf kunnen nadenken. En niet kunnen inzien wat voor oplichter hij is. Ik kan nog heel lang doorgaan over die mafkees, en kan nog zoveel meer van dit soort taferelen opnoemen die ik met die oplichter ben tegen gekomen. Gewoon weer een van de zovele neppe &#39;&#39; self help &#39;&#39; goeroes !Maar laat het hierbij. Krijgen we dadelijk weer van die jankers die hem met hand en tand moeten verdedigen. Dat is hoe een cult werkt !
Geen wonder dat ik dit soort TV programma&#39;s niet meer kijk, in het begin zitten ze al meerdere keren er goed naast over wat er in zo&#39;n boek zou kunnen staan of waar die man voor staat... Wat een oppervlakkig en slecht interview. Wat moet die man wel niet denken...
Wat een wijze/slimme vent
Ik heb zeer veel respect voor peterson en zijn manier van antwoorden op en omgaan met kritiek en haat. Wist niet dat hij een keer op de nederlandse tv aan tafel heeft gezeten. Moet wel zeggen dat ik dit (korte) interview wel heel oppervlakkig vond.
Jordan Peterson is een man van denken. Ongelooflijk hoeveel die man denkt en precies zegt wat hij denkt. Je kan het ook onmiddelijk aan hem zien. De gebaren die hij maakt wanneer hij iets uitlegt. Wanneer Jordan begint te  praten merk je gewoon dat hij al helemaal in zijm verhaal zit en zich helemaal in de vraag positioneert. Hoogst merkwaardig. Ik kan me in zeker zin wel voorstellen waarom sommige hem niet kunnen volgen als hij praat. Buitengewoon intelligent. Alleen maar respect voor zo een persoon. Een uitstervende soort
Ze snappen geen hol van wat hij zegt 100%
Beans
Peterson is echt geweldig!! En inderdaad dat je je ziekte nooit als excuus kan gebruiken
Holy smokes.... dat was de slechtste ondertiteling in lange tijd bij een van de allerbeste gasten in lange tijd.
Jordan Peterson is nog wijzer dan dat hij intelligent is.<br>Iemand die echt tot in zijn diepste wezen de antwoorden op levensvragen weet.
Weer zo&#39;n met opzet vage pseudo intellectueel die zijn &#39;zelfhulp&#39; boeken met niets nieuws vult en waar hij tonnen aan verdient, over de ruggen van na√Øeve  ja knikkers.
Forty effective joints has been translated to four . (When talking about his daughter)<br>I don&#39;t think I need to say that that has a different influence on someone&#39;s life.
&quot;its better to be brave than to be tough&quot; now that&#39;s stuck in me.
Hartstikke leuke man. Vind &#39;m heel sympathiek. Erg intelligent ook. Hoop dat&#39;ie snel weer gezond word en van de opiaten af kan. Jammer alleen dat er zoveel onzin uit zijn mond rolt.
Zijn gezonde logica is suoper, gewoon realistisch, gebaseerd op feiten en onderzoek. Niet op vooringenomen politieke correctheid

His daughter never has much to say because she knows the truth, the son just memics his dad. Only my opinion. Remember the Anti Christ will be a very likeable guy.

You often speak of people who struggle with keeping their living spaces clean. I&#39;m the opposite. I have a routine and I wake up and clean also because I live in a school bus. Is 14 ft long. Some people I&#39;m good living it while it&#39;s messy but not me. Doesn&#39;t matter where I live I systematically clean everything. But I&#39;m not OCD
To maintain a routine, now that, for me, is very difficult to do.

Jordan Peterson was instrumental in saving my career. I used to have a job. And. Now I have a career. Between this man and my wife. I realized my worth. It‚Äôs not about ego. It‚Äôs about knowing what is right and true. Thank you for that. I was in a deep state of depression work wise. Not anymore.

"Jordan Peterson, RFK JR Interview Taken Down From YT Over Transgender Teen Convo: Report","Briahna Joy Gray and Robby Soave react to a recent interview Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did with the Daily Wire's Jordan Peterson, in which he commented that Americans are being subject to endocrine disruptors. #rfkjr #jordanpeterson       

Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. walks down a hallway during a recess at the Monsanto trial being held at the Superior Court of California in San Francisco, California on July 9, 2018. Monsanto is being accused of hiding the dangers of its popular Roundup products. (Josh Edelson/Pool Photo via AP)

According to the CDC, Atrazine is a widely used chlorotriazine herbicide active against broadleaf and grassy weeds. Related chlorotriazine herbicides include simazine, propazine, and cyanazine, all which act by inhibiting plant photosynthesis. Atrazine is applied pre- and post-emergence to agricultural land for crops such as corn and sorghum. It is also used as a non-selective herbicide. Atrazine was first registered as an herbicide in 1958. More than 70 million pounds have been applied annually in recent years, with about 75% of corn cropland receiving treatment.Atrazine has limited water solubility and is not tightly bound to soil, but is leachable in to ground and surface waters. In regions where atrazine is used, it is one of the more commonly detected pesticides in surface and ground waters (USGS, 2007). In soils, atrazine is slowly degraded to dealkylated products, which have half-lives of several months. Bacteria and plants can metabolize atrazine to hydroxyatrazine. Atrazine does not bioaccumulate. It has little toxicity in birds and moderate toxicity in some fish and aquatic invertebrates. Atrazine may alter the sexual development of frogs at environmental levels (Gammon et al., 2005; Hayes et al., 2002; U.S.EPA, 2003a).

If we can&#39;t even talk about it then have are we going to find out if it is the cause for gender dysphoria.<br>I have heard some doctors are having great success with people that have gender dysphoria by checking are correcting their hormones.<br>Men&#39;s testosterone levels are dropping year after year, I guess weak men are easier to control so cancel any disagreement.

Once again Brie is defending censorship.  You can‚Äôt propose a thesis by proving it first.  Since when is it ok to censor something before it‚Äôs 100% proven.  Ridiculous mainstream censorship defense.  You all need to do better your show sucks
Censorship is authoritarian, America was built on free-speech
Alex Jones right again
If you question whether or not America has been taken over by communists, this is another reminder that she has. Only one type of government censors free speech- a communist anti American one.
Alex jones was right yet againüê∏
It&#39;s obvious that chemicals which are endocrine disruptors are causing issues with gender confusion in our world. There&#39;s a direct correlation... but those who trust in science as their religion repeat on autopilot &quot;Correlation doesn&#39;t imply causation&quot; to which I respond.. it DOESN&#39;T mean that it DOESN&#39;T imply causation either.. It may or may not be.. But it has to be researched. That is LITERALLY the point of SCIENCE!
If mother nature didn&#39;t make it you should question it...
The People whom love the governments and corporations over Humanity and Individual Freedom and Justice for All, hate us. They love power and tyrranies. They want us obedient or dead.
I‚Äôve listened to RFK,Jr,s interviews and a lot of what he is answering is about climate change and his take seems to be addressing this in a pollution issues and using free market  enterprise to help solve some of these issues. He usually sites studies to help back up any views and most of what they discuss is multifaceted answers so that people are aware of overall not simplistic drama inducing answers. Also any claims should be able to be backed up.
She makes so many excuses for what the left is doing
When we look past pollution we start to look like our friend china... start up the cancer towns..
Autism is epidemic. 1 in 31 kids are autistic. It was unheard of 40 years ago. Vaccines are definitely implicated.
When other people talk crazy s***, you treat them like crazy, but when you do it it it&#39;s news or something. No one is fooled.
Brianna said &quot;If the chemical exposure is as common as it is - and it is! - why aren&#39;t more people affected?&quot; Because, Brianna, people are different! Some are more susceptible/sensitive to certain things than others are! For a lawyer you do sometimes appear just a tiny bit dense... Same comment goes to Megyn Kelly, who you went on to quote!
They won&#39;t do the studies. Why? May be worth at least listening to Candace Owens&#39; A Shot In The Dark journey at research. There is something to the corruption and collusion in science  and gov. Also, looking into the history of how wrong the experts have been in the past. Now with a moral relativistic world view dominating the people in these fields.....
YouTube was wrong.
Bri is a nice girl but she is somewhat dense at times.
He IS an expert. He&#39;s more of an expert than the people censoring him.
We need to bring Alex Jones back.
It&#39;s funny, when they try to muffle your voice the story only gets bigger.
Of course there not going to Amit it cause there liability for people health
Brianna made a valid point. We have to be able to talk about this stuff. Respectfully. I know for a fact that RFK is very careful with his sources. He has to be, otherwise he will be discredited quickly. Censorship is what happens when a person/org does not have an argument, or a basis of fact.
This feels like Deja vu to our Covid debate and the &quot;conspiracy&quot; of the Wu Han lab which is now proving true. Kim Iversen was the only one right on the issue...There is an increased incident of Autism and Gender Dyshoria he should not be censored for his opinion.
I‚Äôm glad I got to watch it! YT did wrong!!!!!
I&#39;ve been making his point for years now, and would wager that there&#39;s a lot of truth to this idea
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself said, ‚ÄúThere is no time in history where the people who were censoring speech were the good guys.‚Äù There are just way too many people out there with conflicts of interest. It‚Äôs a truth war, and the first casualty is the truth itself??
Briahna is naive to the entire industry that develops to oppose the scientific truth seekers who are looking for connections between toxic chemicals and bad health outcomes.
He maybe overstating the problem...but there&#39;s no denying that a problem exists
I remember around 5-10 years ago, people, mostly liberals, would randomly mention crazy authoritarian stories coming out of China, regarding Government and corporate censorship, and how the government has control over the bigger corporations, creating a state of control, oppression and suppression of information, and using a social credit system to keep everyone in line.<br><br>Now we live in it here in the west, and every &quot;liberal&quot; is cheering it on...  amazing how easy it is to capture everyone.
I‚Äôm lost!!!  What did he say that‚Äôs wrong?  Kennedy is simply a well known person saying what so many people think and have been saying for decades.  Why are so many chemicals allowed in our water and foods not allowed in water and foods in other countries?  Seems like people who want to be blind trying to blind others.
Yes but what if they won‚Äôt allow the studies run that would show those links. They did that with marijauna for years, being able to say there‚Äôs no studies showing it t be safe, yes because no studies were allowed to be done. So what is left but to use a little logic, we know we have endocrine disrupters , we know that we have had an explosion of gender dysphoria , it is not unreasonable to think there may be a correlation.
I dont thibk you take down an interview like this
Studies done by any other institutions control by Bill Gates
Thank you so much for allowing free speech!<br>This is still America üá∫üá∏
Um yeah, does anyone else think this male commentator is condescending and pretentious?  Ive seen a few videos of these two and he crawls up and down my spine with his personality.
When you are censored it means you&#39;re telling the truth ...
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uiy0KBXOlsU&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a> YES Robbie. nailed it. Science is not a religion.
Yes, but. Why does the video talk about if RFK Jr is right or not, when the main issue is that he was censured for raising the question, which in effect is an attack on both constitution and science. But you guys dropped that ball.
Stop the censorship
Briahna does not see Transgenderism as a possible negative outcome of environmental pollution. Many do see it as negative.
Anyone surprised?
Agreed, censorship is inheritendly wrong but didn&#39;t the Hill also censor kim iversen leading to her departure of your program?
There should be nothing objectionable about having a conversation with someone in which you make a reasonable speculation or honestly share what you wonder about or what you have a hunch about. He didn&#39;t state anything untrue. He made a personal conjecture and then explained what leads him to suspect so. There is nothing wrong with this. The censorship is coming the point of, &quot;Don&#39;t THINK along those lines,&quot; and that&#39;s SICK!  This is cultish. You&#39;re not allowed to think, wonder, guess, or make reasonable explorations. Briahna, he did  not make a claim that was a bit too strong. He spoke as an actual human being, honestly. We should not be too fragile to hear an actual person thinking out loud. You know that it&#39;s only because the topic is highly charged politically, and they&#39;re utilizing censorship for those ends. That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong. Not anything that he said, nor how he said it.
These days if it‚Äôs censored, it must be true
Bri is right. If you&#39;re looking at it from a chemical co defense attorney point of view",PT11M11S

‚û§‚û§Transcript (partial):
Part of spiritual development is to recognize the Satanic tendencies that characterize you and to fully wrestle with them and to‚Äî and to integrate them. That's the thing. It's‚Äîit‚Äôs not so much to cast them away. It's to transmute them, you know. And you can see the difference between people who've done that and people who haven't, at least to some degree, because people who haven't integrated the shadow at all are naive. And you can tell that when you look at them and you can tell that when you talk to them. And because they're naive, they're often resentful as well because they get taken advantage of. And someone who's integrated that more, they're dangerous in the‚Äîin the martial arts sort of way, which is they're dangerous, but they don't have to be. They don't have to use it because their presence radiates implicit potential for havoc. And that's really necessary. It's one of the things that gives people self-respect. If you're harmless, you're not virtuous. You're just harmless. You're like a rabbit. A rabbit isn't virtuous. It's just... It just can't do anything except get eaten! It's not virtuous. If you're a monster and you don't act monstrously, then you're virtuous. But you also have to be a monster. Well, you see this all the time. Harry Potter is like that, too. It's like he's‚Äî he's flawed, he's hurt. He's got evil in him. He can talk to snakes, man. He breaks rules all the time. All the time. He's not obedient at all. But, you know, he has a good reason for breaking the rules. And if he couldn't break the rules, him and his little clique of rule breaking, you know, troublemakers, if they didn't break the rules, they wouldn't attain the highest goal. So it's very peculiar, but it's a very, very, very, very common mythological notion. You know, the hero has to be... The hero has to be a monster. But a controlled monster. Batman is like that, you know? I mean, it's‚Äîit's everywhere. It's‚Äîit's the story you always hear. If you're going to be a fighter, you have to want to win and you have to want to hurt people. I mean, not for the sake of hurting them. That's what makes you different than an evil person. But you have to have that capacity. You have to develop that. And, you know, that's a step on the way to enlightenment, weirdly enough, because that isn't what people think. People have been fed this diet of pablum, rights and impulsive freedom for so long. There's just an absolute starvation for the other side of the story. There are no rights, technically speaking, without responsibilities. And all we've had for 60 years is a dialog about rights. Well, that leaves a hole on the other side of the story, and it's a hole that‚Äî that‚Äôs in people's hearts, essentially, because responsibility‚Äî well, perhaps that's not more important than rights. Like I said, they're they're part and parcel of the same formula. But it's in responsibility that most people find the meaning that sustains them through life. It's not in happiness. It's not in impulsive pleasure. Those things blow away at the first ill wind. But to adopt the responsibility for your own well-being and to try to put your family together and to try to serve your community and to try to seek for eternal truth and to live them‚Äî that's the sort of thing that can ground you in‚Äî in your life enough so that you can withstand the difficulty of life. And when you tell people that, especially when you include yourself in the audience, let's say, and you're not finger waving from above, then everyone knows that it's true. There's been this attempt to identify masculine competence and‚Äî and power, let's say, but mostly competence with tyranny. And that's very, very hard on‚Äî on young men. It's also hard on young women, for that matter. But it's very helpful for people to hear that they should make themselves competent and dangerous and take their proper place in the world because it's the alternative to being weak. And weak is not good. The people who shoot up the high schools, they're weak. They're weak. And life is a very difficult process. And you're not prepared for it unless...",1446465,47703,1157,2022-12-07T13:00:00Z,"There are 3 types off people in the world. Wolves, sheep, and sheep dogs.

No. Learning to be a monster first, too many people will stay on that path of felt power. History tells us, that people who get power first will mostly turn out to be absolute assholes and disrupt their social environment. Learning kindness first is the harder way, as it makes one temporarily vulnerable, but one will come out mature and be able to control the own dark and light emotions. <br>Mr. Jackson asks many good questions and comes up with many good answers to initiate a thorough discussion - but presenting these thoughts as a definitive statement is a complete failure in my opinion.

Tamara Lich is a Canadian activist with a background organizing the 2018-2019 Yellow Vest protests in Alberta. She was also an early founder of the secession movement in western Canada known as WEXIT. Lich also had a prior career in the logistics field regarding Canadian energy and first became vocal about the unrivaled efficiency of her country‚Äôs fossil fuel industry, despite the mainstream media claiming otherwise.

I just wanted to thank Tamara Lich from here. I think she still is not realizing how big of an impact the trucker convoy (as the first big organized opposition on a global scale) took on the whole Covid puppet show. <br>Heros of our time!<br>From Luxembourg/Europe
Tamara and the truckers are heroes to me. I can&#39;t believe the Canadian government is using lawfare against her. I also follow you Jordan, your an amazing voice in the world and proud to call you a Canadian. Keep up the fight in your court case as well.
This PM is more Scandal Ridden than all put together before IT. RIGHT now is blocking a PUBLIC INQUIRY.<br><br>           <b>IT does not care and needs to GO</b> NDP break off with Liberals. Force a ELECTION.
I found the first of this interview a bit odd. Jordan talked to the left when the guest was to the right. The camera angles were a bit wonky maybe? Anyway I enjoy the content nonetheless.
Dr. P.  Thank you for telling this story and the people involved.  As an American, we to have idiots in our government.  Our leadership comes from the Forrest Gump school of leadership.  Well done sir.
I&#39;m so glad to learn that there are more reasonable people in Canada, besides Jordan Peterson.
üëç
Yessssss!!! Canadians! Bravo üëèüèº
This is the interview all Canadians need to see
I followed several livestreams throughout the trucker convoy/protest from Texass.  I&#39;m sure hundreds of thousands maybe millions of others around the world did as well.  I was so proud of you all and remembered specifically that our great northern neighbor, always humble, stood up to help lead the world and show us all the way.  Several trucker convoys in the U.S. did indeed follow your lead and drove across the country, but never congrated long in one place. . .I guess we wussed out a bit.  Still we followed your lead and I was proud that our nation knew when it was time to follow and who to follow.  Thank  you all so much for your courage and kindness!
Loving all these interviews with Tamara and love her books
And Jeremy McKenzie who dealt with Bank of Nova Scotia for years was called on the phone by the bank who told him they no longer wanted his business. Closed his accounts and said F Off
Dear Doc, Would you consider interviewing a Interesting Fellow Canadian by name of Shawn James of My Self Reliance youtube fame? He, you might say is Modern Day Dick Proenneke. Thanks Mr Peterson for what you do Sir. Except for your Mike Pence, Dan Crenshaw Interviews, Great Stuff
Tamara should run for Canadians, nice to see someone with leadership qualities and actually care about real Canadians‚Ä¶<br><br>ALL THE BEST‚Ä¶
Thank you for bringing Tamara. We were in Ottawa too and donated money.. Later i saw the map with all names of people who donated and their addresses .My too. Trudeau government reminds me on former Soviet union where my family is originally from.
HOA üëçüíñüëã
Excellent interview. Tamara&#39;s book &quot;Hold the Line&quot; is a must read. Thank you to both Tamara and Jordan- you are Canadian heroes!
Alberta‚Äôs population is 4.6M
Love these women that are so patriotic unlike Trudeau&#39;s gang of thieves!
To be clear, Americans obviously know where Canada is (same as we know Mexico), we just despise the country and have no respect for it. Speaking for decent Americans only of course
Canadians are the BEST example of the human race, bar none.
Tamara and the truckers are heroes. I was shocked that other industries didn&#39;t join them especially the healthcare workers.
GODLOVES YOU &amp; SO DO I
I totally disagree with Jordan&#39;s interpretation of Abraham&#39;s life in Mesopotamia.  While he still had slaves,  he still had to supervise, check the condition of his flocks, train the camels and donkeys etc.  He moved part way to the Promised Land with his father, Terah, but Abraham had to complete the journey himself.  One of the major themes of the Old Testament is to reject idols.   Moving out of the land of idols and becoming a friend of God are essential themes.  Jordan misses much of the meaning of these Bible stories because he denies a personal yet transcendent God.
Thank you Tamara! You gave us back hope and a renewed love for our fellow Canadians and our country.<br>Sadly, we have learned how Communist Trudeau&#39;s radical globalist ideologue party really is üòî
China is buying people in Canada and The USA.

Thanks to Tamara, the Canadian flag was flown all over the world as a symbol of freedom.
She is much more intelligent than the media portrayed her to be.

Just unbelievable.
Thank you Tamara.
I guess they get what they vote for. Sad but true
Thank you Tamara for standing up to Justin Castro. You&#39;re a true Canadian Hero üá®üá¶<br>Thank you for standing up for our Freedom! ‚ù§ I still don&#39;t know what happened with the Give send Go money... I think he seized the money as we are &quot;A fringe minority with unacceptable views&quot;
Why were the Ottawa Police so dysfunctional compared to the OPP?  It was due to former Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson who didn&#39;t want to be blamed for anything while at the same time sucking up to Trudeau. Watson kept interfering with former Chief Sloly. The entire Ottawa Police Services Board resigned over this. It was Trudeau and Watson who were to blame. You can look it up: Google &#39;I can‚Äôt be a part of these dirty politics‚Äô (including quotes. You will see what was what.
What the fuck Canada?
I&#39;m so happy that this interview happened. I was at the trucker protest. And am still dealing with people who look down at me for being there.
Jordan allow your guest to speak and just listen. Have you not learned anything from Rogan ?

Thank you Tamara.
You gave us hope.  All hundreds and thousands of flags respectfully held by 100s of thousands of families along the canadian highways and  globally return our faith in humanity‚ù§ God bless you.
Tamara Leich makes me proud to be Canadian...thank you, thank you!!!
What a lovely soul!  ‚ù§
First podcast of yours that I can not find common ground on with you. Most of the time, I&#39;m 80-100% in agreement. She made hee bed and can damn well lie in it.
I think the 10 million was what freaked JT out. The paranoia of a <b>***</b> infused frenzy sent him off in his own imaginings. Even to the point of running away from people who just wanted to reason with him. What a ****.",PT1H48M38S

This has nothing to do with onlyfans models
he‚Äôs one of those who wants everyone to get a 9-5 job making almost nothing, get married, go deep into debt and raise children while living in a trailer or an apartment because you don‚Äôt make enough to save for a down payment and buy a home, and do as your told and make the corporations money that he‚Äôs invested in so he can get richer along with his corporate elite pals.  He does not want to make the world a better place, he does not want to see this country rise to the heights we once enjoyed when we had a strong middle class and a weak upper class.
I landed here because of the title but got something much deeper. Whoa...perfectly aligns with that statement by the crafters of the NWO...&quot;you will own nothing and be happy.&quot;
72K views and the video has nothing to do with the title at all.
This video is good, but the music is a bit overbearing and distracting.
My favorite part of this clip is when they talked about OnlyFans models
Wrong Title - Again
Buddhists believe that the self is an illusion created by the ego, which makes us feel separate when we are not, leading to all kinds of strife and disharmony. Maybe the reason China has come so far in their development in such a short time is because their culture encourages them to work together for the common good above any self interest?
Huh, I never thought of the postmodern &quot;individual&quot; like that before. But, yeah, I can totally see it. Most groups simply want to win the argument.
Please turn the music up a little louder I could almost hear them
What does this video have to do with onlyfans models?
Why disha is on thumbnail
I had to turn off the video because of the background &quot;dramatic&quot; music.
PLEEEEASE TURN UP THE MUSIC, BECAUSE I CAN STILL HEAR WHAT THEY SAY
music too loud
The music in this video is awful.  It ruins a really great discussion.
There is so much wrong with this video-- the clickbait title, the irritating music, the weird and distracting video. But the ideas and discussion of Peterson and Rogan are so good that these are actually extremely important messages.
I have a hard time listening over the background music. üéºOh does Joe Rogan still think the moon landings never happened?üë©‚ÄçüöÄüöÄ
Why did you put that noise as a backing. So annoying.
I hate people that enter a situation with their mind made up when reality cannot influence their opinion. <br><br>They want to arrive as the one that knows and leave as the one that knew. <br><br>Nothing gets through, they have this stubborn ignorance to stay as they are and no logic or well constructed reasoning gets through I think they seek validation some sort of special skill or ability that gets them recognition or approval but they just look desperate and stupid to anyone paying attention. <br><br>I think they are the reason punching was invented!
annnnnd NO mention of the topic in the title of the video....
What‚Äôs with the shitty background noises‚Ä¶
I always love hearing Jordan Peterson, but I&#39;m down-voting because of the click-bait title.
A Christian isn‚Äôt autonomous. Religion is about servitude to a devine being.
God damn that ambiance is loud and annoying.
Though Christ was the Logos of God He claimed all authority in Heaven and Earth.
Henry Ford only ever built one automobile in his day, &quot;The Quadricycle&quot; but he took home 85% of the profits thereafter. And it didn&#39;t even have windshield whippers.
Thank God or your producers. I thought that annoying background music was all in my head.
Playing power games is a silly move.. there is always someone more powerful around the corner<br>and this world is top level sick<br>it is infuriating<br>so that ultimate power will have a very short fuse
music makes this unlistenable
&quot;&quot;...a quick road to moral virtue...&quot;. Bingo!!<br>(I could live without the Muzak)

Yes thank you Mr. Peterson for taking on the cancel culture woke mobs. I can only imagine at what cost. <br>  Like you suggest I&#39;m trying to take some responsibility for what has to be the most difficult of  lives... mine. Sure buddy people will say... <br> I&#39;m a targeted individual. With half of you already  afraid of it and the other half thinking I&#39;m crazy I still continue, after all it&#39;s my responsibility to speak out.<br> Were not thought of as the &quot;tin foil hat crowd&quot; anymore but we should be especially now.  My god ok just say what it is. Organized stalking, gang stalking, slow kill etc. <br> Call it whatever you wish it will soon crush two thirds of everyone so begs the  question why is no one talking about it. <br>  For crying out loud how else will the deep state and the United Nations usher in Agenda 30 and 50. Think. Half fossil usage in 7 years. Does anyone understand that. None by 2050. Get smart why doesn&#39;t anyone think people will rebel when told their money and homes will be needed to boost incomes in 3rd world countries or when a world government replaces America and every other country, what then. Yes control will be needed.<br>  Mk ultra is going to be the weapon of choice in bringing about world equality. <br>   And hell no remote neural monitoring is not scientific research and should be supported. This tool of control, torcher and murder should not be supported by anyone especially the psychiatric community. Conflict of interest by God.         <br>  Sacrifices must be made.     Please discuss this. Considering it will destroy two thirds of us please go to war with the military industrial complex please launch your arsenal now. <br> Many must sacrifice themselves in order to stop it. It&#39;s not enough for only those  under attack to talk about it. William Binney, Dr. Robert Duncan, Dr. Johnathan Hall and Dr. Erich Kalstrum are all under attack and speaking out about it but it&#39;s not enough. A very large  audience is required and soon. Yeah it&#39;s that important.
would love to actually hear what&#39;s being said but the music is overpowering...
That music!!!  I could stand about 45 seconds- no more!!!!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh................................
why the annoying background musicüòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
Couldn‚Äôt finish. Background music is too fucking loud, too fucking everything.
Thanks for the Click Bait. The video has noting to do with only fans models and everything to do with left wing extremism. While JP makes a damn good point. The video is still CLICK BAIT. People would have watched this video anyway had you given it the correct title. But I have no respect for Click Baiters.
Background music is stupid and unnecessarily loud
What an absolute click bait, and main idea is so badly edited by cutting, that it looses all points of normal sense! and cheap music in a background to cover that shameless edit.
You know why there&#39;s so many assholes in the world? Because, people let them get away with it. Mr. Inbetween
Very annoying music, what is the point of adding music, it&#39;s completely uneccessary.
Everyone‚Äôs default is if others don‚Äôt agree with my world view they must be lying or dumb. Never crosses their mind there may be value in conversation. Very boring.
The background drone is really annoying.
Lower the music.
Ah. So that&#39;s why girls have sex on camera for money. Thanks JP.",PT10M21S

Thumbnail makes this look like a podcast interview (or similar) with Jordan Peterson. In fact it is I think just a sequence of clips recorded and produced by others than the producers of this channel. I have sympathy with small channels that do daring things, and big ones that are humble, but not both, the other and the wrong way round. This channel should use its resources to better procure or design a suitable thumbnail, or produce an alternative video that matches the thumbnail.

Jordan Peterson is a blessing to many. I achieved success after I practiced the steps below.
Doesn&#39;t commitments and work towards a goal even if it is a hobby count as responsibility?
üëåüèø
The mind is definitely something that can be transformed, and meditation is a means to transform it.
fill your head with love and hustle dont let these ppl tell you who you are.
for the german speakers:<br><br>In diesem YouTube-Video geht es darum, wie wichtig es ist, Ziele im Leben zu haben und diese zu verfolgen, um ein erf√ºlltes Leben f√ºhren zu k√∂nnen. Dazu geh√∂ren Familie, Freunde, Karriere, Bildungsziele und Freizeitpl√§ne. Wenn man diese Dinge nicht hat, bleibt nur Leid und Elend. Es wird betont, dass man an der Universit√§t herausfinden sollte, wer man sein m√∂chte und wie man diese Person werden kann. Dazu geh√∂rt auch, sich selbst nicht zu tyrannisieren, sondern mit sich selbst zu verhandeln, wie man mit jemandem verhandeln w√ºrde, dem man ein gutes Leben und Produktivit√§t w√ºnscht. <br><br>Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt ist, dass man sich bewusst sein sollte, wie wertvoll die eigene Zeit ist und sie nicht verschwenden sollte. Wenn man seine Zeit verschwendet, kostet das nicht nur einen selbst, sondern auch die Menschen, mit denen man vernetzt ist. <br><br>Schlie√ülich wird betont, dass es wichtig ist, Verantwortung f√ºr das eigene Leben zu √ºbernehmen und die Dinge, die man tun oder lassen sollte, ernst zu nehmen. Denn wenn man nicht alles tut, was man kann, um das Beste aus seinem Leben herauszuholen, kann das nicht nur das eigene Leben negativ beeinflussen, sondern auch das Leben der Menschen, mit denen man verbunden ist.<br><br>Zusammenfassend: Es ist wichtig, Ziele im Leben zu haben und diese zu verfolgen, um ein erf√ºlltes Leben f√ºhren zu k√∂nnen. Dabei sollte man sich bewusst sein, wie wertvoll die eigene Zeit ist und sie nicht verschwenden. Verantwortung f√ºr das eigene Leben zu √ºbernehmen und die Dinge, die man tun oder lassen sollte, ernst zu nehmen, ist entscheidend f√ºr ein gl√ºckliches und erfolgreiches Leben.

Brilliant!
I liked him untill he got into religion, which he knows nothing about. It is just the way he was raised and never learned to research the truth. He who is convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.
Wish i could find a therapist like this. Everytime i manage to drag myself to get help i just get given pills that dont realy help they just take away my ability to care my issues until they are even worse.
I wish being sick with cancer was easier. I‚Äôve been battling over a decade with it and it interferes with the ability to have a proper functioning schedule. <br>Let me interrupt myself and say that I love Jordan Peterson and watch/listen to everything I find of his and they are brilliant.<br>I have anxieties and struggles that the average person lacks. I may have the time I wish to get to bed and the time to wake up but chemotherapy really does a number to me and one day I may have all this anxious energy and the next I wake up at 7am with no alarm and feel pretty darned good through the day‚Ä¶.until I begin to work on the items in my schedule and then the exhaustion kicks in from the meds/chemo. I may spend the first hour of my day in the bathroom dry heaving or vomiting: food if I ate the night before or just bile and the dry heaves. That initial hour of the day can really ruin any planned advancement in working on myself. The next day(after being constipated from chemo and sometimes pain meds) I spend an hour in the bathroom again dealing with clearing my bowels. The laxatives, both OTC and Rx only work on this type of being backed up so it‚Äôs a rough time and often have very little success. Perhaps I‚Äôll bring an enema in to solve the issue but all that‚Äôs gotten backed up is how I define the term ‚Äúshitting bricks‚Äù. It will provide SOME relief but still it frequently only takes care of half of what should be expelled. So I‚Äôm drained of energy after 1-2 hours being awake. <br>I hate it, hate it hate it.<br>I could go on with the things that interfere in a way that prevents being able to use my schedule at all. There are many like me out there. Im not a rare version of the human experience. If I‚Äôve overshared I‚Äôm not really sorry. Those not having to deal with all the above in addition to intense bone pains and muscle cramps or simply lack of energy again from the treatment that keeps the cancer in check but not gone. It will be with me forever. Prior to this all beginning and becoming most of my days I have had jobs I absolutely adored and looked forward to going into. Those were good decades of working bliss which I am grateful to have had the blessing to have. I had a couple jobs that were just blah and a few I tried out that were awful but I‚Äôd do all I could to make those awful jobs be very short term. And then out of nowhere find one I loved. I‚Äôm now in my 50‚Äôs and that makes things more complicated. No one is looking to hire the cancerous guy who needs to be late OFTEN, take breaks OFTEN and on no schedule. I have vomit bags in my car so if the wave of nausea hits while driving I can grab a bag if I lack time &amp; opportunity to pull of the road and I vomit while doing 30-65mph and I haven‚Äôt a choice. And god forbid some fails to make it into the bag! That happens and I then need to spend 10minutes to an hour cleaning it up. That makes me late to a lot of planned events. Ugh.<br>I‚Äôve said enough. I think anyone who reads this gets it.<br>It‚Äôs just such a blockade to proper life functioning.<br>Still though I can always listen to more Jordan or a few rare others and try to find the light in that darkness. Jordan helps the most. Man I wish I could have him as a personal therapist. That would be amazing.<br>Peace and love to you all‚Ä¶especially Jordan Peterson. A truly amazing man, human, mammal, carbon being and amazing mind.

Nobody can become financially successful overnight. They put in background work but we tend to see the finished part. Fear is a dangerous component, hindering us from taking bold steps we need in other to reach our goals. you have to contend with inflation, recession, decisions from the Feds and all. I was able to increase my portfolio by $289k in months. You have to seek for help in the right places.
JP always knows what to say. I needed this, I‚Äôve been feeling so lost on my own path I feel like I‚Äôm dragging the people I love with me
In the beginning when you listed off things you recommend that others should have figured out in their life.<br><br>I noticed that you didn&#39;t mention anything about emotional health, only mental and physical health.<br><br>I knew that my senses were correct when it told that you have a weakness or blind spot that you don&#39;t see exist.<br><br>Where do emotions come from Jordan? Why do people feel any emotions at all?<br><br>You said that if we don&#39;t have most of the things you listed as your recommendation of goals people should aim for OR else you may find yourself suffering and in misery.<br><br>Those are things that impacts a person&#39;s emotions right? It will also create chaos in the mind as well but those 2 things linger by clawing at your heart, affecting your emotional and mental health right?<br><br>If it doesn&#39;t affect emotional health, then suffering and misery would be something most people will not feel uncomfortable experiencing.<br><br>Do you think that changing ones perspective or telling yourself with the mind not to suffer or be miserable makes it go away? That its something you can think your way out of it?<br><br>You believe that those you speak to can avoid or get themselves out of that by laying out a solid path to educational field, career path, goals that they want to accomplish, to succeed, financial security, material abundance.<br><br>All of those would earn them respect and honor from others, a testament to what they have done for themselves, which translates into a person of value who contributes to society and will be celebrated for their work.<br><br>Nowhere in there do you mention that they should be happy during the process or that they will be happy after they reach the end. Is that not important?<br><br>Everything you suggest they should have in order can help contribute towards them eventually feeling happy but will not sustain that happiness without some other important factors you left out.<br><br>I believe you are suggesting that it&#39;s not important that we be happy during this process or even consider whether everything we&#39;ve worked hard for truly makes us happy.<br><br>That tells me that you are not happy, or that you even care about feeling happy for it is of little use to you.<br><br>If you want to be a programmed robot, that choice is yours. Most people do not want to be unhappy like you.<br><br>It&#39;s a sad miserable lonely existence.<br><br>You claim that family and friends are a necessity at their foundation. Why? Why must you make sure that other human beings make up your foundation?<br><br>What if had traumatic experiences with most or all of you family as a child? What if the friends you found yourself meeting in your life display narcissistic behavior?<br><br>Having people that equally reciprocate an exchange of energies that uplifts you both would be wonderful but because we have no control how others show up in our life, depending on something like that could end up causing harm.<br><br>Maybe you were given the opportunity to have a wife and a daughter who support you, that care and love you. I just have great doubts that your wife and you experience feelings of romance and intense desire and love for one another.<br><br>If I were to ask your wife whether feelings of passion and desire are felt by her when she thinks of you, she would say no.<br><br>She loves you, cares about you, supports you, will be there for you, but what you don&#39;t have is any burning passion and raw emotional feelings or any increase in blood flow or heart beats when you are in physical proximity or when thoughts of each other comes up.<br><br>I&#39;m willing to bet that if your wife was to encounter some deep emotions with another man, someone who stirs this warmth within her depths, arousal from her attraction to him physically, imagining lustful intimate consumption of one another, that she wouldn&#39;t consider entertaining that man.<br><br>If he affected her deep enough, due to the lack of such experiences and emotions in her life, given the right circumstances, she has a high probability of giving in.<br><br>There is no romance between you. Perhaps you don&#39;t care much for it, which is fine.<br><br>What about your wife? Are you sure she doesn&#39;t?<br><br>You are mistaken.<br><br>If I opened up a portal before her and told her that all she needed to do was to step through this and into another reality where all of that which I described would be hers on top of what she already finds comfortable in her present life, only the man that she experienced that new life with would be someone physically different than you, someone she is attracted to, she would take it.<br><br>You assume that she wouldn&#39;t want something like that but you are wrong.<br><br>Maybe you enjoy being emotionless, not waste time with romance and passion.<br><br>Don&#39;t be so sure that your wife wouldn&#39;t want that for herself. She hides her feelings of loneliness for even when you&#39;re physically with her, there&#39;s still a feeling of emptiness, the spark and excitement missing.<br><br>Its only because of her duty and obligation that she feels she must honor with you and her daughter that she sacrifices her own wants and needs because that is what is expected from her.<br><br>She will say she does so because making you 2 happy makes her happy but does it? What about her being happy?<br><br>Then again, you don&#39;t care about happiness do you? Of course.<br><br>You couldn&#39;t care less if she&#39;s happy
Family, friends, career, educational goals? Better have most of them, who are we thought about those things? Who says we are left in misery or is that just a pure example from the most people ? What is each one of those things for you? Go to school, graduate, become an employee pay taxes? Make a family , make more  future employees or what is the plan with that?
He is not right, people being alone, does not always suffer or have misery, they enjoy time alone, without people, a monk for example, a nun for example, so Jordan is just generalize. Not good!

Detransition: The Wounds That Won't Heal | Chloe Cole | EP 319,"Dr Jordan B Peterson sits down with 18 year old de-transitioner Chloe Cole. Chloe was indoctrinated, affirmed, and set on an irreparable path at the age of 15, and now finds herself abandoned by the community and the doctors that lead her over the edge.

Chloe Cole is an 18-year-old de-transitioner from The Central Valley of California. She started her transition at 12 years old, puberty blockers and testosterone at 13, and had a double mastectomy at 15 years old. She is now a strong advocate against gender ideology.

Dr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

This should be required information before any permanence.
I&#39;m thinking that the mass majority of these WEF/ Hitlerfarian Drs are on the spectrum as well.
The amount of anger I felt listening to her describe that schoolyard assault, is difficult to process.  What an incredibly brave person.  She&#39;d make a great Mom.
Beautiful Cole, teach younger kids not to destroy, multilate thier beautiful body
She is beautiful and an intillegent woman. . , in her younger years, she was a victim of constant, day to day bombardment thru media, SOCMED, manipulation, brainwashing, lied, fooled of transgenderism. . . Your are on the RIGHT TRACK Cole, save more younger kids, fight for it !
Very sad for this lady. She should have had parents. Real parents.
I&#39;m in my mid-sixties and I don&#39;t know what sexual dysfunction is or Miss function whatever she called it.
This Woman os amazing  I thank God for honesty  and what she  experienced  it takes a stong person to come face to face  with yourself  and helping othets I have great  respect  thanks  Sandra  Charbonneau

Cosmetic surgery industry has overgrown and trespasses its domain limits for the purpose of a profit.
They have Gage this so that young women are influenced by it by the time they hit puberty and having a menstrual cycle. Can cause young women who are influenced by this ideology to think that they can become a boy and not to have to have a menstrual cycle so by introducing his ideology at a young age it increases the effectiveness other agenda because it really affects young women once they hit their menstrual cycle...<br>Because now they can go back to like they grew up most of their life and not have it...
As a psychotherapist I can honestly say that I have never heard such a distressing case against my profession, I am sickened by it!!! Where are we going!!! How on earth did we get to this !!!!<br>I‚Äôm in shock and disbelief üò¢
I just finished to watch the entire video. Especially the last... ten minutes were emotional.<br><br>That being said, I can&#39;t help but wonder, how many of the specialists listed here acted out the way they did, because if acting other way would have got them cancelled, due to which they would have lost the livelihood, as did the psychologist, whom dr. Peterson refeared, who had done gender dysforia studies back in the days? I know I am affected by this possibility. My only fortune probably is that I am not in the field of medicine.<br><br>Taking a step that majority doesn&#39;t support can be a 40 year exodus in to a desert. A step into unknown that you are afraid to take, even if the step is the right one.
When I was 9,10,11yrs old I spent ALL my free time in the water at the lake. I thought I was an Actual Mermaid that was born with legs.

Jesus is the way,the truth and the light of the world. Parents please teach your children about jesus. I will be praying for these children and parents in the name of jesus.

I&#39;m just crying. I hope it will help children stop damaging themselves
He talks way too much. I just wanna hear her story
Forward this to your state congressional leaders and request that they pass laws requiring counseling of this sort. Perhaps even better is requiring an appropriate amount of educational curriculum for pre-pubescent girls. Maybe the first the best you could hope for with blue states.
Where is the source or study that Scandinavian women have more negative emotions than other countries? That is not my experience at all living here. We are maybe reserved as a people in general compared to other countries. But I found his statement a bit odd. Anybody know his source for saying this?
Thank God for Dr. Peterson, Matt Walsh and this brave girl because this world is going crazy or evil because only truly evil people could do something like this to the joung
How is she this mature at 15 though?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O3MzPeomqs&amp;t=1h56m25s"">1:56:25</a> I&#39;d be upsetting &quot;the real transgender&quot; people....this speaks volumes on how &quot;supportive&quot; that community of sociopaths is. Absolute cancer human beings pushing children into doing this to themselves just so they can enforce their own delusion. Sickening üò¢
I love how passionate Jordan is talking about things like medical data and how Chloe‚Äôs parents were put in a corner w/ ‚Äúyou can have a trans child or no child‚Äù.<br><br>And I want to say thank you Chloe for being so open and honest.<br><br>Also watching this makes me think of Jazz Jennings and how hard it must be for her to go through things like this all out in the open as a child and how difficult it must be.<br>It‚Äôs all just really sad &amp; my heart goes out to anyone going through this.
Sad
Absolutely criminal!!! No doubt!!!
It should not be an option Damn it! Kids need parents with brains and critical thinking capabilities. What is happenings evil!
So she was an athlete or at least enjoyed sports, had a model‚Äôs body, autistic people are extremely smart at the low end of autism,she‚Äôs a kid( who can‚Äôt relate to those years)some dental sales bring on early puberty. When the frontal lobe develops in our bodies well into our twenties we start to think straight! I don‚Äôt think that research is true. Not complicated at all in my opinion. No the internet isn‚Äôt a reality space! Kids should not have it. Feminist, that‚Äôs a source of BS. Pregnancy is beautiful and birth, nothing is more beautiful if you do it naturally!evidence, please!she can adopt! She will be a great mom! Better than her own.friends is a joke/ family is what matters if it can matter. End of discussion. Frontal lobe isn‚Äôt developed yet. How dare these people do this to our children!
This is going to be 98% of these people and their lives are being ruined one thing to dress up and wear bows in your. Another thing to have your breasts removed and to have a hysterectomy and have a fake fallac surgically implanted in the area of your vagina that&#39;s outrageous. Never should be done anyone at 18 and probably 21 we need to make a federal law  stopping this isanity it&#39;s child abuse.
Parents and Doctors are to blame for this epidemic, and demons.
Dereliction of responsibility and negligence is a very accurate statement. This is real<br>malpractice. This is easy money on the table for a few savvy tort lawyers! Informed consent was NOT applied here at all!!
What is the point of therapy if they just agree)?
Poor girl, so unfair. Made me think of celebs kids that are forced to wear opposite sex clothes. Way to confuse and fuck up an entire generation
I wish my granddaughter would open up to this conversation
Were you the only child in the family suffering from this gender disphoria?
Listening to your story is difficult to digest but informative. Seriously,  you get screwed by social media and doctors!
I‚Äôm glad this wasn‚Äôt an option and my parents were in poverty! When I was 10-15yo I surely thought I was behind on the girl development then I developed muscle tone on my skinny bones ü¶¥ I struggled and a lady told me I shaped like a boy‚Ä¶ my mother hinted that she thought I was gay. Society is horrible!!! This has caused a boom in the cosmetic sector ppl feeling like they have to pick a side look really feminine or look really masculine or be bullied.
This is how much therapists care when you don‚Äôt get the right one‚Ä¶ had bad experience with this with my son. You have to be 100 steps ahead of them to pick the good ones.
My who agree to cut up this young person why would you do this to a child and not sit her down and talk to her these people should be jail and now the government is saying its their rights all because they want the votes of these confuse people  so sad
I truly feel if more women were honest about their pubescent experiences, they‚Äôd sound extremely similar to this young lady. Not in terms of becoming trans and then de-transitioning, but having sexual fantasies about other women, thinking they are supposed to be boys (emergence of many Tomboys), and the desperate need to physically fit in. I, myself, have felt and struggled with each of those things. Luckily, I had a mother who explained that I could be a strong, intelligent woman and encouraged me on that path alongside biblical wisdom and principle. I am so happy that this young woman was able to come out of her darkness and be so open about her path. She has a beautiful, strong, and powerful soul.
OMG
Chloe&#39;s story is a very saddening one. I&#39;m moved by her story. The main aspect about commercial medicine is fraud. Without fraud they&#39;d never be able to sell anything (drugs and unnecessary surgeries).<br><br>Negative emotions? Here is a hint, the food people eat. You want pain during puberty, eat the normal American diet. You want to avoid pain during puberty, avoid toxic foods that will rob you of mineral and vitamins like B1 and B12... eat more fats, etc. These are things that can be avoided if taken the proper steps / precautions. <br><br>One of which is the FDA so-called awesome food pyramid. Flip it and not just flip it, delete/avoid everything the FDA tells you is good for you. Start with that.
They need counsellors like Jordan Peterson in the transgender clinics to counsel, in depth, those who are making this long term decision.  All love to you Chloe for your courage in speaking up.
This is so sickening Dr.Mengele is rejoicing in his grave.<br>These medical people are criminals
Thank you Chloe for speaking out. This is so hard. My heart breaks for you. Thank you for using your voice to help others.",PT2H7M37S

Duh
Why do you always cry
I learned years ago that the phrase &quot;grass isn&#39;t always greener on the other side&quot; is TRUE.  All positions have good &amp; bad qualities, advantages &amp; disadvantages.  Often we leave something because we tell ourselves &quot;it will be so much better&quot; only to find you traded one set of issues or annoyances for another, only now you have to become acclimated all over again with similar issues to the position.  Changing to another job is on the list of &quot;life altering events&quot; with marriage, divorce, childbirth, death of a loved one, &amp; moving to another state. It can turn into something stressful filled with regret if time wasn&#39;t taken to carefully weigh the new position&#39;s pros &amp; cons, location &amp; culture/environment beforehand.

Man, this was a speech,
His tone of voice is like a melody to my soul I love him he has truly changed my life
If I had a father like Dr Jordon Peterson my life would have Definitely turned out better
Jordan Peterson is a blessing to many. I achieved success after I practiced the steps below.
As a psychologist Jordan sells nothing but words to support his family. <br><br>Jordan USES his license as a psychologist  in public, to belittle those who are transgender, which causes harm to that minority. I suggest it is Jordan&#39;s behavior that is unethical, and that as a psychologist, he needs to be retrained ... or let go of his license.  <br><br>If one of Jordan&#39;s children had come to Jordan and said &quot;Dad, I was born in the wrong body, and when I become an adult I would like to have a sex change operation,&quot; does anyone believe that Jordan would have counseled his own flesh and blood with the following NASTY, BITTER words? <br><br>In January Jordan claimed on ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience‚Äù podcast that being transgender is a result of a ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù and similar to ‚Äúsatanic ritual abuse,‚Äù and suggested that acceptance of the trans community is a sign that ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs collapsing.‚Äù
The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are blocking money from coming to them with their thoughts.
Imi place ca barbatul sa mi aduca micul dejun la pat si sa ma rasfete inainte de a pleca la munca fiecare n treaba lui
I like his words but the accompanying images are trite, obvious and a little insulting. This is why his interviews are more powerful because it is just him with no distractions.
Jordan really is just a very very cool, down to earth straight shooter no bullshit guy! And super intelligent. If ONLY all school teachers were just 20% alike, or judges,policemen. Yeh ppl<br>May not agree with some of his opinions, theories but if we had teachers or ppl in power CEO‚Äôs , bosses he would teach you not sack u , put u down. Ect. And he‚Äôs funny as !
Ohhhhh who is this man and why so fascinating meeeeee <br>He single?
Ethos!
The slave mentality.
Ain&#39;t no freedom in control,,but those in control believe they r free
It doesn&#39;t seem like a choice

Unfortunately it don&#39;t work like that the best brain surgeons never have the money to go to college. Rich people send their kids to college to be a brain surgeon and they really should be sweeping floors.
What I need is to have my money and have a business even without a partner.
Music?
You work for 40 years to have $1M in your retirement, meanwhile some people are putting just $10K in a meme coin from just few months ago and now they are multimillionaires.....
Somehow I would really appreciate these videos without the background music!! Or may it‚Äôs just me
Life is tragedy tainted by malevolence üòÆ yet the ability of the human spirit to transcend is more powerful than the tragedy &amp; malevolence itself ü§©‚Ä¶and to overcome, to experience transcendence against life‚Äôs inherent tragedies and manifestations of malevolence, is what we are built for - the nobility of striving to overcome while keeping one‚Äôs own malevolence in check - is exactly what gives life purpose and meaning.
These are the things that should be taught in schools but then they would have no control
The video maker likes to workout üòÖ‚ù§
I am so excited I just bought my ticket to hear Jordan Peterson talk. üôåüèºüôèüèΩüôåüèº
idk why but he sounds like saul goodman lol
What about CHILD ABUSES ???!!!
The &quot;first thing&quot; he should have addressing is the mass and mass harm the majority is participating in and perpetuating,  but Jordan is too harmed and too arrogant to acknowledge he and the majority are wrong in so many ways.   <br><br>Where are you people who see the fundamental core problem causing the majority of human caused problems?!?!
Thanks a lot
I wish jordan was my dad
God, this man can talk.
I am 52 and boy do I wish we had you around when I was younger x

After renting in the san Francisco Bay Area for 40 years and raising a family my wife and I bought a parcel of &quot;raw&quot; land 750 miles away in another state.  We&#39;ve been working on it for 7 years.  We&#39;re building a cabin with our own hands from lumber we milled ourselves.  The greatest adventure of our lives.  Sometimes scary , always an adventure.  To live a life debt-free and no rent.  The dream is alive.  Don&#39;t let your fear stop you.  &quot;The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.&quot;   Joseph campbell",PT22M27S

Ep.352",214300,5107,746,2023-04-27T15:01:39Z,"Simply wonderful. A rich, insightful and compassionate exchange.  It had the perfume of peace and possibility. Thank you.
As someone who is moderate leaning conservative, I want to know what you were going to say @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynw7KqJx4g&amp;t=10m14s"">10:14</a>
5% art talk
on Duchamp you bought the art history woke nonsense ...calling his urinal art
Amazing conversation,  expanded my vision about the art. I truly enjoyed it! Thank you üòä
few people like Jordan Peterson .we need more men like him.
Arrival in the UK.!<br>Not US.<br>Sort the transcript.!3.02-3.08.
awesome
It is a pity that the interview did not touch on art until about two-thirds of the way in.
As an artist, I thank you for this beautiful and careful conversation. Those mercurial and Trickster elements you speak of remind me I need to revisit Lewis Hyde‚Äôs The Gift, and Trickster Makes the World. He would no doubt be another fantastic interlocutor on this subject.
Please let Joe talk without interrupting I know it‚Äôs had for you and I say that not in a bad way just try be more thoughtful
If Art is the Point then get an artist talking about the creative process, not an intellectual and ex -barrister/art dealer talking about art commerce and evaluation
Thank you sir
Mitigating circumstances is not the same as not guilty of a crime. It should go to pardon or clemency.
‚Äú thinking about doing it or even doing it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre guilty‚Äù?! So you do a crime but the other side cannot prove it so you are acquitted/not guilty of the crime even if you actually committed it. Talk about subjective moral warping on the level of the trans activism Peterson criticizes. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynw7KqJx4g&amp;t=1h28m00s"">1:28:00</a> What kind of relativistic hogwash is this?
These three things remain, faith, hope, and love; and the greatest of them all is love. This conversation puts thus Scripture from 1 Cointhians in another context. Beautifull.
Market value is often dependent merely on fashion...
It strikes me this is a lot like eavesdropping on a therapy session‚Ä¶but with a therapist you wish you had‚Ä¶ who was not afraid of explaining you to you.  Beautiful‚Ä¶Good for Mr. Hage‚Ä¶wish he had had a more dysfunctional life so we could all have better insight into ourselves.
Hope is good for breakfast ‚Ä¶bad for dinner.
Thank you!!üôÉüôè‚ù§
Amazing discussion Jordan
Art is part of a production from pain
Good interview. Too bad they did not talk about how AI art will impact art.
I think the tyrannical subjugation of art is not necessarily a corruption of the artistic process. Looking at your own collection of art specifically the Soviet realist that you collected, it is hard to find a more tyrannically subjugated period of art. Yet you found value in the pieces.
Oh my God. Van Gogh was a failure.  Basquit was a failure.  His take on art is totally weird. He needs to listen to Kurt Vonnegut. <br>What is an artist? We are all co-creators of the world with God. All the indigenous people make art to honor the creation and not to make money. Iconographers serve God, not the dollar. He is so twisted.  I am sorry. Most real artists care about their art first. And a lot of them don&#39;t even show their work publicly.  Man he would hate Bach.  Do you know Bach, the composer, penniless and worked for the church. Cecil Collins, the great artist, was penniless and poor and not recognized as a real artist, now in the Tate Museum. What is he talking about? So sorry but this is nonsense.
A bit much hearing these two non-artists debating the art issue. So much more complex. JP is a hero...but  his arrogance and ignorance when discussing art are an embarrassment. Zero humility.
the last hour is the most interesting
It goes boring boring boring  &quot;ART IS A MICRODOSE OF PSYCHEDELICS!&quot; oH, now I get it!
Now I want to see Jordan&#39;s third floor with its  exquisite art and beauty.
I think true art will always burst or ooze through constraints as it has ultimate power
Great conversation, thanks for the introduction to Joe Hage.  I am an artist with some success, to me beauty if everything.  Uplifting conversation. Thank you both for the light and wisdom you are bringing to a dark world.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynw7KqJx4g&amp;t=13m48s"">13:48</a> the ultimate question to land on your date
Wonder what Vincent had painted if he took your path
beautiful talk but BOY OH BOY are these 2 thinkers WRONG when they say you aren‚Äôt an artist if your art doesn‚Äôt sell. guys who have been making big money for a while tend to lose perspective. the value of art in commerce is wonderful but that doesn‚Äôt invalidate artist whose work isn‚Äôt readily available and sold regularly.

This episode saved my soul ‚ù§
Can we just take a minute to notice that gorgeous fireplace as they talk about art! That green is magnificent ‚ù§
In a book I&#39;m writing I have the main character &#39;dining&#39; at a gourmet outdoor event at a resort. She is a bit confused because there are no menus and the waiter(s) recite the evening&#39;s culinary schedule. Her date explains that unlike normal restaurants where you order what you want from a menu, at the resort, you are a guest of Chef and as Chef&#39;s guest you must trust Chef for the content. Like a great symphony conductor you must trust the content of the experience to Chef. Chef is therefor an artist, not a cook.
Good art like good science fiction gets you to think (and/or feel). It is in the end a means of communication or impetus of thought. Sometimes people who study art find all kinds of things about a piece that a novice couldn&#39;t see if they tried. Many times the art gains meaning beyond itself by placing it in context. It may not be the best example of cubism, but it was the first and opened the door to cubism. That last fact gives it meaning that by itself would have only confused someone who thought it wasn&#39;t nearly as good cubism as pieces that came later. But as a transitional piece, it suddenly gains importance. <br>The value of art is it&#39;s nexus with meaning. We search for understanding and meaning in our lives, and art can tap into that in many different ways because of many different contexts. The &quot;woman in gold&quot; was also valuable because it represented something precious to the family that had everything take from them by the Nazis. It represents something that survived the Nazi too. There are many reasons we assign value and meaning to an art piece and all of them are created by the observer; without someone to look at the art, it has no value beyond the material.<br>If you like a piece of art, and it&#39;s genuine, you should, if you can afford it, buy it, and enjoy it. If you&#39;re buying it for economics or boasting power, you might as well play the stock market without caring about the companies; its an abuse of wealth.
Peterson mentioned the urinal art piece. I hadn&#39;t heard of that before and imagined that all the intellectuals would be praising it&#39;s genius. I imagined I&#39;d see it, surrounded by all these idiots trying to one up each other in their praises of the piece, walk up to it, unzip my fly and start peeing in it. When the guards and gallery personnel rush in, with half of them trying to deal with the patrons who had fainted at my bold act and the other half trying to stop me and yelling at me to stop desecrating the piece of &#39;high&#39; art, I&#39;d finish peeing, shake the last little bit out, zip up my fly, and say, &quot;Now it&#39;s an art piece.&quot; Within an hour I&#39;d be praised by the same group of idiots as a genius greater than Duchamp.
Im feeling sadly last mouths and im just realizing that things around me do not have any story to tell.<br>Art makes you feel good the objects are just objects
I would love to hear more interviews on Art. This was most refreshing and as an Artist I was totally engrossed üôè
And... the FIREPLACE AND THE TWO TONE GREEN WALLS. Breathtaking. I can&#39;t take my eyes off them.
God made me to bring beauty into the world. This talk is wonderful.

Anything else is from Lucifer as he tries to currupt everything
You might as well make a law to not say cuss words.
Im not using your stupid pronouns
Never ever indulge the crazy people
He doesn&#39;t say the words in the click bait title.
You got this ENTIRELY WRONG!  The professor is John McWhorter, who is a brilliant person, and anything but &quot;woke&quot; (he&#39;s actually actively anti-woke.)  And he&#39;s NOT owned by Peterson.  He brilliantly pushes Peterson on HOW he makes his decisions on pronoun usage (Peterson was less than cautious in saying that he could tell when such usage was appropriate, and McWhorter pushed him for details on the process, that Peterson ultimately couldn&#39;t provide.)  In fact, you can hear Peterson wriggle and avoid the question by going back to &quot;I won&#39;t because I was compelled,&quot; before admitting that he might be wrong.  So I&#39;d score this clearly a McWhorter win, in Peterson&#39;s admission that he can&#39;t 100% tell and might be wrong, when he originally stated confidently that he could tell.  BUT, all this said, McWhorter and Peterson are amiable academics, and it&#39;s moronic to think that this is a battle for victory when it&#39;s a mutual struggle to reach a more sharply honed truth, which is what they ultimately did in clarifying Peterson&#39;s original statement.
I couldn&#39;t get what the video was saying bc of what was happening in the video. There were so many things happening that doesn&#39;t feel related to it other than showing Jordan Peterson talking. Did anyone else not get it bc of that?
I wish that the video just keep focusing on Peterson talking instead of moving around on different scenes
Dear Dr. J. Peterson, you are here following the lead of a &#39;student&#39; who you say you would not follow the manipulative lead of. Notice his response when you had to hesitate in you response &amp; he suggested  it was too complicated for you to answer. So he triex to turn the discussion into a wrestling matc.h. The best support of the truth I hear, is, as you have already ,often presented, namely,  the scientific &amp; statistical proof of male &amp; female &amp; the evidential use of twisted science by those who  desire to control my  manipulative arguments ,just to try to destroy your presentation of the truth. Religions do the same with The Truth of God, as did the pharisees, but they were angered by the truth expressed in short responses by Jesus.
I will not. Fuck political correctness let us actually educate our kids.
If it‚Äôs not attention seeking behavior, why do they care so much what I think or what pronoun I call them behind their backs? My biggest issue, WHY ARE THEY GOING AFTER OUR CHILDREN? AND‚Ä¶. Why are kids being taken away from loving parents cuz they rather go get them help than taking puberty blockers? That‚Äôs my biggest issue‚Ä¶ I can ignore everything else‚Ä¶ but not that
the guy asking the question seemed quite intelligent and spoke very well but Peterson countered everything so eloquently it&#39;s amazing to watch.
The soundtrack makes it all funny
Misleading title. The questioner is not &#39;woke.&#39; Also, he sounds a LOT like John McWhorter. If anyone can verify this please do, because McWhorter is actually pretty anti-woke. But whatever. You clearly don&#39;t care.
The professor he‚Äôs responding to is John Mcwhorter, who literally wrote the book on being Anti-Woke (‚ÄúWoke Racism‚Äù). Just because someone is critical of JP doesn‚Äôt automatically put them in the ‚Äúwoke professor‚Äù box. If we want to make genuine progress and overcome the woke ideologues then we should probably try to avoid becoming dogmatic ideologues ourselves. Just a thought‚Ä¶
A fine approach until &quot;IT&#39;S MA&#39;AM!!&quot; shows up in your class.
In 15-20 years we will live in a world where people will be serving prison sentences for saying things like this. Thoughtcrime will become a reality.
That &quot;Woke Professor&quot; sounds an awful lot like linguistics Professor John McWhorter of Columbia University, as well as creator of the Lexicon Valley podcast. The very same John McWhorter who authored &quot;Woke Racism&quot;. Anyone who has read this book would understand that accusing him of being Woke is a bit off the mark.<br><br>If you doubt me, I recommend you take the time to listen to a snippet of a podcast episode to see if I&#39;m right. And if I am right, this video, while definitely worth the list, has a title that is a bit misleading.
This title is completely inappropriate and clickbait.
I feel this man had clear intentions of being confrontational and might be a gender pronoun person and asked Jordan these questions in not a genuine way but try to outsmart him or make him look bad
What a compassionate, fair and thoughtful response from JP.
To call John McWhorter  a &quot;woke professor&quot; is stupid
To be true, Left woke people have gone insane. It&#39;s bad at this point.
I don‚Äôt get the whole gender neutral thing and I‚Äôm not interested about it either. I‚Äôve been educated to say him and her etc, not ze, zirs. Even my spell checker on my iPhone 13 doesn‚Äôt recognise it so why should I start now.<br>If I put this forward to my Nan or father in law they wouldn‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm talking about, if they had a small speck of knowledge about it they‚Äôd say ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be talking stupid, there is no such thing as that‚Äô.
I feel like a TABLE today, you ALL should call me a TABLE!! Not a humanüòÇ
I recognize myself as a BEAUTIFUL AND SMART WOMAN, so call me beautiful and smart.
The adobe filler cut scenes are super annoying
Can a white person asked to called black?
My wish for those people. Interact by yourselfs. Leave us others alone.
Maybe in naive but i dont understand why it is not treated as mental illness like body dysmorphiar (spelt wrong)  as ot seems they just dont like who they are and have depression and the fact they cant just say &quot;yeah i am a man but wanted to be woman coz i think its better and easier and i no im not a biological women&quot; is crazy to me! If i get arrested im gonna play with the cops so much üòÇ going to not give real name and say i identify as Shakespeare hogan and that i sometimes want to be a women
This video would have been so much better without the stupid animations and the dumb music
Linguistic freedom!
Very interesting dialogue between two smart people! That&#39;s what I love. Actual discussion with actual arguments!
Absolutely everyone I know is appauled that men who feel they&#39;re really women are now trying to occupy the morale high ground. Utterly ridiculous. Absolute fantasyland. In the trans community they can happily and easily adopt any title that they please. Obviously in the real world it is utter madness.
Spot on Mr. Peterson
I don&#39;t care what mental disorder you have or what trauma you&#39;ve been through, if you think you get your own individual pronouns outside of the ones we all decided upon, you are a terrible person
The professor&#39;s voice sounds like John McWhorter&#39;s, a linguist at Columbia. If so, it&#39;s certainly an error to describe him as a &quot;Woke Professor.&quot; McWhorter has taken lots of flak in opposing race studies and other leftist ideology. It sounds like he&#39;s asking Jordan to nuance a point he made--that&#39;s all. You can&#39;t slap a clickbait title on a video with actual thinkers or you do a disservice to the people who actually listen to it closely and care about understanding.
You can call John McWorther a lot of things but not a woke professor.....he wrote a book called woke racism....
ET is what  non-binary not human but  reptilian descent
Cruel video title. Both people speaking were respectful
I&#39;m on the side of Jordan because I identify as an academic who acknowledges the fields of biology, law, pyschology and common sense.
Based
I will never use people&#39;s stupid pronouns. This is absurd. If i cant tell what you are then youre hey you.
So I&#39;ve learned If you go to hell you&#39;ll have the absolute worst demon punishment You can ever imagine and that is how new demons are created with about thirty years of insanity and zero thoughts of your life ever again, It&#39;s actually worse but it&#39;s hard to explain If you want to try and understand you can try to ask the demon angels they&#39;ll probably tell you if your spiritual Senses are high enough to talk to them in your head or Use a pendulum and be very professional or You can use substances, The best I found is tramadol I think any opium would work, Alcohol/weed isn&#39;t good enough, but be careful<br><br>I also found out that you can make The angels if you torture them enough to call their supervisors which after 2 or 3 should get you their demon God on Earth which can&#39;t leave Earth and can be infinitely manipulated by regular demons like lilith because they are so unintelligible, Which means they can force them to give them their energy and then banishing them, causing an infinite loophole of free energy for demon life, Which they love and will give you anything they can
Good ol disingenuous John McWhorter whos buddy I respect much Glenn loury puts up with his shenanigans.
these visual inserts are so annoying, I wish you wouldve just shown the raw footage
They, Them = Legion
they..like a turd in your pocket? dude?
We need real bad ass bullying back in schools.
Mislabeled video. This professor wrote a book called ‚ÄúWoke Racism‚Äù against wokeness. He is asking a very reasonable question and Peterson uses a lot of words to say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù even though Peterson  apparently just said he did know.",PT7M25S

I almost.cried when you described being thankful for what&#39;s in front of you, therefore you find meaning in keeping said things as orderly as possible &amp; then you grow .. etc. That&#39;s so true as nowadays people only think about what&#39;s next &amp;  loose complete interest in the belongings they already own
Only unfortunate is that the captions run right accross those beautiful pictures.
these videos be so much better without the music like the music just sends the videos off. there&#39;s no need for the music lmao
I wasted 32 years of my life, before I finally understood, that my biggest enemy of mine is me
He&#39;s tearing me up bro. Restores my hope
I don&#39;t have the courage to complete the video.
Man, this is so good. Thank you Jordan Peterson.
I see so many comments about people wanting to make more money, totally understandable but, I think the point of his videos is to look within and face your demons: the things you don&#39;t want to look at, the things you don&#39;t like about yourself and to fix them with every ounce of your being. Doing that you will end up making money
nigga wtf?
I would elect this
Oh my god .. I am fortunate to hear this today and I will revisit my comment 2 years later to see where am in life.. thanks for sharing the video.
This guy puts down andrew tate saying andrews vision is bad for the world, but the thing is this guy preaches the exact same topic as andrew just in a different approach.. the difference is andrew doesnt talk down other who try to motivate people....the ones who talk the most about others shows who they are in life...
no friends, i lose my GF and my parents hates my decisions of my POV. I dont know where and how to create. hopefully someone here will become my friends

That&#39;s great, The transitions are at the optimum points and even the text.. Um .... Well I want to make a humble request of answering the software used for these fabulous videosü§îü§îüí¨
Amazing
Seeing others tackling different topics was my fuel In the learning process despite not being part of it
I&#39;m 35 old man and I just discovered Jordan P. This video is so moving and true. I wish I knew him before!
Discipline Yourself.
Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness. Napoleon Hillüòçü§©
I used to have a friend who I used to tell him how miserable I was at my job and the place where I lived and he would tell me that it didn‚Äôt matter what I felt. That I should appreciate the job I had and that me wanting more, wanting to do better in life was me being ungrateful but one day I got tired of him never being supportive of the things I wanted in life, of him always condemning me wanting to do better. I‚Äôm glad I walked away from him.
This motivational speech help my progress &amp; love one&#39;s
You don&#39;t need motivation, <br>     You just need to complete your to-do list
20 minutes that completely change life, GBU Jordan Peterson!
So Discipline means,,. Punctuality and schedule to you,,,,,,,,,, <br>that is not discipline,,,  discipline is mannerism,, did you know that ######

Thank you Dr Peterson for all you do.This one hit home about the negative type of traits that have held me back from being my true self and improving myself as an individual and provider! Really wish your show wasn&#39;t sold out here in kelowna! For others we need to protect this man from Trudeau and the rest of them!!!

Nothing more spiritually renewing than hearing Jordan Peterson speak. His words are so congruent to the reality of things, it‚Äôs almost like the universe is unloading its secrets through him.

You both are good strategic conversationalists and multidimensional thinkers disguised as the first line of defense for the system. The subliminals and deep manipulation tactics to reshape and try to change hands of power in current market, tells everything, and that will never recover. 100 push ups right now for anyone listening without conscious and self-awareness. Lex, doing a good job man facilitating the current agenda and future agendas in the most discerned ways, disgraceful. Practice more, you&#39;re welcome
So all ‚Äúliberals and or progressives ‚Äú are evil but all ‚Äú conservatives and or right wings‚Äù are good <br>Who is waging war on whom? Who needs outside enemies when we are our enemies üòÇ
Not sure where JP gets the stat that Holland is 2nd biggest exporter of agricultural products
JP: is it possible for there to be too many people on earth?  If so, how would you know?  How about climate change and reduction in biodiversity.  If the birth rate being below replacement is not acceptable, this implies that only population growth is acceptable.  But this can&#39;t continue indefinitely, can it.  If there is a finite best number of people living on earth, then why would it be more than the current number?
Its cringe whenever he talks about faith ü§°
so there is beauty in Chaos ?  could there be clarity in messiness ?
Remove this song bro.  I love your other songs and music bro but I think you might be Ill-informed .
Good job Lex, calling out his hypocrisy and arrogance, in such a diplomatic way that he actually tried to respond. I couldn&#39;t do it. Peterson is so full of himself as a &#39;know it all&quot; that it is hard to believe you could get through to him. He is so ignorant of the &quot;left&quot; and the history of the 20th century, he can&#39;t even define &#39;communist&#39; yet hell make up statements like &quot;they killed 100,000,000&quot; If you can sit in the same room and call him CANE to his face, yet get such little movement, I think his narcissism is beyond curable. Hubris is a deadly sin, and lacking humility he can never be honest even with himself. The way he appeals to the involuntarily celibate is insidious. He may have once been the victim of bullies, not anymore, now he is the bully. He is become.
A religio<br><br>This guest was probably typical of a minimally educated science idiot too influenced by religion !
at the end of the day, you can never fully trust an atheist
Dear Mister Peterson, i hold you in the highest regard, you are an inspiration, i know you would want me to say this, as we all still are able to learn something new each day, but Data is the most expensive thing on our planet, unfortunately, you can ask one of Suckerberg&#39;s colons...<br>Stay Blessed <br>Peace <br>üôè‚ù§‚úå
Sometimes, Lex, says things that are just plain stupid.
Men on the moon.? Chemical aerosol  stratospheric injection,.?<br>The international Banking cabaal&#39;s usury, <br>born from sociological indoctrinated perception. ü§îüôÑ
Epic! ‚ù§
The most expensive appreciation in the world is priceless, and that is the soul..<br>I pray you keep the strenght of inner peace  as the blessing upon your journey.‚ù§üôè
Jordan ignores many facts.<br>First one is tha every liter of gasoline releases to the enviroment more than 56 millions of Joules in Heat,every liter,then u dont have to be a genius to understand that is a huge amount of heat only in one liter of gasoline,multiply it to hundred of thousands of cars in your town,then realize how wrong u are jordan,and many others.We are burning our HOME,the only one&#39;s.
We are overpopulated...thats a fact. Every child born has a foot print of 10000square meters of forest and jungles. We are a lot of. Im not sure where this guy peterson claim that is antitruth im wondering why or if he ha$ some advic‚Ç¨$ u know...strange.
What about the Non Disclosure Agreement Trudeau has with the family of the student from Point Gray Academy?
So Lex... how do your feelings sit about this interview 10 months later? I am curious... I watch more to watch you and your evolution and have often wondered what you think and how you feel about these deep topic interviews after the fact?<br><br>Do you ever look back on interviews with a different perspective? How do you manage that conflict?<br><br>Pardon the off topic comment, suppose I am thinking of you.
All the people who keep saying global population is not a problem---   what would be?  How many?  The earth is just a giant terrarium, it has a limit...  so what is it?
Jordan is an angry Man who took the Jab . Elon Never Put a Car in outer Space . <br>Water always finds it&#39;s Level .   If Earth Moved at all we would never see the same sky , much less have exact alignment with a structure on the land .  Earth is Flat and it does not Move . Take your Globe and Go Home<br><br>We inhabit a motionless realm covered by an impenetrable dome.<br><br>We use gas pressure to debunk space that directly represents the heliocentric model. <br><br>Space is a direct violation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.<br><br>Using science to disprove the heliocentric model is the best way to get people to learn the truth.<br><br><br>0ne thing I know for certain, we&#39;ve been lied to . God&#39;s Word makes it Clear .<br><br>In this Realm there are Hundreds of Other Continents where they sell our Data and Creativity .<br><br>If you believe in a globe earth, outer space travel, or virus transmission....<br><br>YOU ARE NOT AWAKE<br><br>0ne thing I know for certain, we&#39;ve been lied to about everything. It&#39;s never stupid or crazy to ask questions and seek the TRUTH , If you have buoyancy and density than Gravity is just a made up BS Word .<br><br>DITRH , Sage of Quay . Eric Dubay . Mark Sargent , UAP Chanel , Flat Earth British , Jon Levi  , for peats Sake Earth is Flat Already .<br><br><br>The younger dryas was very bad, mostly because the older dryas wasn&#39;t around enough to give it a proper upbringing. you can&#39;t have a vacuum of Space and an Atmosphere without a barrier.
Thoughts on Jordan&#39;s response to &quot;Beauty saves the world&quot;:<br><br>This quote is frequently taken out of context. It is not Mishkin who utters these words, but rather his friend telling us that Mishkin said so. Mishkin himself remains silent and refrains from commenting. The only remark Mishkin makes regarding Nastasya is, &quot;If only there would be kindness to that, everything would be saved&quot;, implying that beauty is empty if not filled with kindness, and alone cannot save anything, but if only kindness than &quot;everything will be saved&quot;. In the context of Dostoevsky, &quot;kindness&quot; encompasses a combination of qualities such as conciseness, humbleness (modesty), awareness, and care for others. Humbleness (modesty) in its essence is a permanent guilt feelings towards others to achieve to sense of thankfulness for experiencing the act of being.<br><br>The word &quot;world&quot; is typically translated too narrowly in this situation. The Russian word &quot;mir&quot; signifies not just the world or planet but also humanity and peace. Many overlook the irony in the quote, &quot;Beauty will save the peace,&quot; especially when it is objectively directed at an individual female. <br><br>Hmm... this comment is missing something... <br><br>smileys...!<br><br>Here is üê¶and aüêù<br>To make you üåüand feel likeüå≥<br>To let you ü§îand to ü´Ç<br>A serious ü§£on your... or... in your... or... well... <br><br>Apologies, I am bored making something to make it not so boring.

Lex here is the secret to everlasting energy! this  is serious!<br>energy is measure in seconds for example 1joule for one second. let&#39;s imagine me putting 1 joule of energy of singing for one second. by doing it in a chamber or resonance manner like a echo. my joules turns into multiple joules of energy through time. a echo (a resonance) of what you do without echo) by adding echo you not only gain joules but you gain it in time and that time can be considered the first initial joule. the circle, the servant doesn&#39;t bites its tail it pushes it!. the echo as all the energy needed to infinity energy when it is mastered as energy. i did succeed in doing this without mechanical parts. there is so much energy in a feedbacks, mastering it is like walking on a rope between skyscrapers. not to mention back emf! is equal to getting it all back to infinity when mastered..yeap yeap. dear friend people know this to be true thanks to my heart. lovely friend.
The way this guy talks just kinda reels me in. Like he really has something important to say. I‚Äôm not sure I am capturing everything. üòÖ

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY8aFSY2zv4&amp;t=2h04m00s"">2:04:00</a> is a rough timestamp for me, anecdote on changes from ketosis/carnivore/lion diet
Real art is never taken for granted... too simple, too chaotic... how about no Jordan. How about art can be anything to anyone for any reason any time. Beware of any a hole who distinguishes real art. Also what does being religious or spiritual have to do with appreciating art? The former are mere categories as they relate to the latter.<br>Jordan is saying good luck with a better world without faith in God? If so, I am confused. It may just be semantics but it sounds more like some sophistry or delusion from him... it&#39;s okay, we all do it or have done it to some acceptable degree. <br>Some believe that religious/spiritual practices &amp;/or faith are our only means for helping to build toward, &amp;/or better align oneself with, a better world. Other people see spirituality as not requiring faith but moreso as an optional, epistemological practicality. Whatever common, utilitarian, humanitarian goodness, justice, and clarity we can achieve in working together is better than less to none no matter what. A good God would love a doubting Thomas who loves their family and neighbors too much to risk them being fooled yet again by the devils cults...
its really intelectual
youtube sure does cook the books. i have never clicked on a lex podcast/youtube in my life that i know of (not that i dislike them tbh...some are ok), but, if i leave a queue running it will always show a lex video after my queue is done. i am generally listening to yt while doing stuff so i am too lazy to come back and click anything. <br>i have screenshots of lex fridman being listed on the YT recommend bar on the right...where 28 of 34 recommended videos are lex!?!! LOL. even better, i started a new google/yt acct. and have made sure not to click...yet...here we go again..this came up after a queue of 4 tucker carlson vids. LOL
People who have a problem with JP,R first, jealous second aggressive, and third simple dump a smorgasbord of stupid
Is it compassion to feed a hungry gator your six-year-old son?<br>Is it compassion to give a job to someone who does not deserve it or will not do the best job because of sex or race, knowing that it will hurt other people in the long run.
10 million bigots intellectualism is the #1 threat in America.  Where is the thought police on this one.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY8aFSY2zv4&amp;t=54m54s"">54:54</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY8aFSY2zv4&amp;t=2h47m46s"">2:47:46</a> I too believe no one is exclusive of being evil, this modern idea of that people are inherently good or evil is blasphemy. The idea let‚Äôs you cut yourself off from others, we‚Äôre all humans all built the same. Talk about having empathy, regardless of your beliefs your human. People hate people who hate people, such a cycle will not end.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY8aFSY2zv4&amp;t=55m18s"">55:18</a> &quot;It&#39;s the spirit of Cain&quot;<br>Without skipping a beat, he goes right down to the very bottom. Cain&#39;s the very beginning. Holy shit.
&quot;For the listeners, Jodan just gave me a firm handshake&quot;.
Unremarkable interview....watched this per request of a friend who asked for an opinion....don&#39;t have high opinions here, is amazing that when people seek the spotlight the quality of the work cannot be high, truth seekers will avoid the inescapable pitfalls of publicity and fame.....first the story of Cain and Able is poorly interpreted....the whole point of the Biblical story is that the sacrifices were of equal worth but received differently by God, like a Father who has a preference for one child over another.....is a very human story.....but if you give all the responsibility to Cain you miss the point of how he (Cain) would deal with being the unfavored child....so here the interviewee missed the boat in preference of his self responsibility bias....a good bias just not applicable to the story of Cain and Able. What is truly remarkable is that it is clearly understood that the Old Testament was written or compiled by pastoralists of sheep (semitic herders of sheep that in the iron to bronze age transition became the Israelites)....and it therefore should surprise no one that the God of the pastoralists preferred the sacrifice of Abel (himself a pastoralist) over the sacrifice of Cain (a farmer). <br>So ....Meh....<br><br>Secondly the bias of the interviewer and interviewee, a western bias is unable to accept that indeed the  regime since 2014 instituted in the Ukraine is Neonazi. It simply is. It is sad to me that in trying to create nationhood where there is no nation the politicians have referred to past symbols of hate and wholeheartedly identified with them and practiced the hate that they espoused. <br><br>So there is no doubt that Russia is in the right here and defending areas that are Russian (politically) and are further critical to Russian security. How many times in the last 250 years only has the West attacked with devastating force the people of Eastern Europe or Russia. So I ask then that the interviewer who claims both Russian and Ukrainian origin go study more deeply his subject matter and the Canadian with a large audience be more careful with his words.  It is sad to me to lose the illusion of a benevolent United States. Sadly since 1991 the US behavior in foreign policy is overt, absurd and destructive and done to solve internal politics that have nothing to do with the external realities. The US thinks itself so dominant that it can simply drop $2 trillion of bombs on Afghanistan in a fabled war of terror, get up and leave, oh, that was nice....see ya later....and then repeat the same in the Ukraine (as it has done in 30 countries). The authority here is of course Seymour Hersh. That there is no atonement for the immense destruction visited on Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya by the US people who dangerously stay ambivalent or ignorant of its nations actions is to me very scary for I like the interviewee believe in the Divine. Should be remarkable to him that in 1917 great miracles happened in Fatima, Portugal and 3 children witnessed the Holy Mother. One of the asks was pray for Russia, pray for Russia nation of Portugal and the world shall have peace.  So here both the interviewer and interviewee again are claiming depth and seekers and observers, but come across shallow.<br><br>Duc in altum
Always love to listen to Dr. Peterson. A physicist that I enjoy listening to said that the question of God is not a scientific question; it is  a philosophical question. Thanks for having JP on. Great conversation. P.S. The biography of Michaelangelo,  The Agony and the Ecstacy.

Love you both - the joy of open dialogue - the fountain of Logos
4000 year old paintings? yeah right

Bisdden the bigest liar he has no clue abot time dates... 2020... Its 2009! AL GORE SAID ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND N. Y. BE UNDER WATER.. LIARS AND FEARPORN
Given enough time - all things die.  And even the sun will expire.  Most of this talk is a waste of breath.  Live in the moment.
the best responses from Peterson were the ones he responded with absolute certainty and conviction, COMPASSION IS NOT A VIRTUE
Wait a minute hold on. No sexual scandals with trudeau? That&#39;s false. Why did he leave his teaching position half way through the year again? What about that reporter that he grabbed and said if he knew she was a reporter wouldn&#39;t have assaulted her? 1 other instance I&#39;m forgetting too. Jordan come on brother

I do here here this from a lot of people about marriage that it&#39;s just a piece of paper and then I realize that this will likely be one the of people who will suffer in their relationships going forward.
Absolutely
What if you&#39;re older and you didn&#39;t get the lessons at the right time in your twenties or 30s and it&#39;s too late to get married and have children what are you supposed to do at that point then to find meaning I guess just kill yourself That&#39;s basically what I get from this
üôè
So...according to past  lectures:, if I am an overly aggreeable person, then I have an overactive conscience, which means I shouldn&#39;t listen to it.! So to manipulate me, all a psycopathic person has to do is lie to me to activate my conscience. It is all very confusing.
Bottom line don&#39;tB.S YOURSELFüòÖ
@jordanpeterson if I could have one conversation with you it&#39;d be my greatest mind and thought that&#39;d be what you change but what are the chances of someone famous sacrificing time to someone like me
Study Islam,you will find the real truth..
My habit protect me from having a dream about anyone and does not bother anyone
Before my dad he died for first time I have a dream one of my tooth fall down I told my mom about the dream and she hit me with the shoes i cry for manny munth i cant forget him untill naw his hope to make me something i think he found his way naw  i make a mistake to say something never happen  im just was same pan when my dad died the freem about him was natural  but what I apologize about never was a dream or activate  was attention to found the way out
I thought that this ended on a weird note.  The &quot;good luck filling the hole.&quot;  My confidence is the light inside of me, and it kept there from being a hole.  It never came from believing a god was going to be there or fill me with something.  It was always up to me to make things happen and to fill holes.  Luck or fate or randomness was but a small part of it.  Religion in particular is a thing I don&#39;t want filling my head or heart actually.
My dad if he doesn&#39;t work he not leaving the bible from his hand  one time after he died 12 years my mom she coming in my dream and she told me dad he want to talk to me I told her I know what he want we went to his room and he&#39;s in good looking  not the same he died with liver cirrhosis anyway he told me he&#39;d been long time and he have to go another place and to go the other place someone from the family have to take his place I told him if you want my mom go ahead and take her after 4 month ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I have a dream I bear my dad three different times I know he lost some were probably he  l found a Moses somewhere and then get back together
Are family  8  brother 5  brother and 3 sister the Big brother study production designer 2 doctor 3 engineering 4 nurse 5 teacher  6 teacher  7 Magister nursing   8 no buddy father and mather did working hard to support brother college
Jordan I would rather take my chances with man eating sharks than violate my own conscience for a little while
Are we polling the tree üå≤
Is the sull the important any way what he cud do with out me I  can&#39;t do with him
Wee have to poll the tree in are side to not lose
Wee have the power conscience and work handy prove
Wee have the power to open the door
I‚Äôm crying this is so good; So unbelievably good üôè‚ú®üíØ
Thank You for this instruction and reminder. I struggle greatly with a stepson who has had serious clinical addiction and anger issues the entire 7 years of our marriage, and he just turned 21. If I could ever attain the knowledge that he professes to have, I would reduce Einstein to shame, but yet I must hold my tongue. While conversing with him, I&#39;m continually reminded of a saying, &quot;It&#39;s what you learn AFTER you know it all that REALLY counts&quot;. Again, thank you for your immense insight!
How do I remain consistent to the course in this world?
Thanks Jordan ‚ù§

Because i grew up  been i aggreeable person but finally the resentfullment it stroke me...

I wonder how much Jordan likes to be alone with his self?<br><br>The reason Jordan Peterson became famous. <br><br>Has Jordan been threatened by anybody in the law in Canada ... for not saying respectful words that he refused to say? NO ‚Ä¶ he has not. <br><br>After 7 years of Bill C-16 being put into law, to in turn protect those who are transgender from harassment ... albeit that he has been very disrespectful to those who are transgender ‚Ä¶ not even one person from the law ‚Ä¶ or from the transgender community has bothered Jordan.<br><br>His claim was and is ... ludicrous. <br><br>As rude as he has been, not even the people who are transgender care enough to take Jordan to court for not showing respect for them.<br><br>That story about us Canadians losing our freedom of speech was Jordan&#39;s claim to fame. <br><br>And because of his lie being exposed ... if he loses his fame ... well ... that&#39;s life. <br><br>In January Jordan claimed on ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience‚Äù podcast that being transgender is a result of a ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù and similar to ‚Äúsatanic ritual abuse,‚Äù and suggested that acceptance of the trans community is a sign that ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs collapsing.‚Äù

&#39;conflict delayed is conflict multiplied&#39; Great quote Dr. Peterson! that&#39;s just like the Sun Tsu quote to the extent that to put off war is to allow your enemy to grow stronger at your expense.   And it is something that is not being taught to young men today. In that they are not provided with the tools to address conflict in a constructive manner realistic to the situation... in a world that is not a liberal arts campus; yet in which we must all strive to live in as peaceful a way as possible.

Stop the disrespectfull abuse behavior toward others.

THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS GREATLY CHANGED,  FOR THE BETTER,  MY APPROACH TO LIFE !  MANY REGARDS !
Dr Peterson,  you are controversial because you have common sense and intelligence to boot, things our society lacks.  They attack what they do not understand.  You have helped me and my family so much.   We are very grateful for your small presence in our lives via the internet. <br>Please don&#39;t get discouraged.
No matter when or what I hear Jordan say,  my stomach gets into a knot and all I can do tearfully agree and hopefully apply that truth to my life.  It&#39;s profound.

At this moment, it is crucial for individuals to prioritize investing in alternative streams of income that are not reliant on the government, particularly with the existing worldwide economic crisis. Investing in stocks, gold, silver, and digital currencies can still be profitable during this period. Therefore, it is advisable to explore these investment options to secure one&#39;s financial future.

Oh Joe.  As much as I appreciate your thirst for knowledge you truly don‚Äôt give two shits about optics.  Maybe give a disclaimer or a warning before you have some of your guest on.  Jordan might be somewhat smart he is definitely not intelligent.
I have no idea why the so called ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù try to portray Jordan as some kind of far-right dangerous person. The ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù are immensely regressive in morality, logic, and intelligence.
Doesnt get much better than this. Hope you have Dr Peterson on again someday
Four years later and Joe&#39;s &quot;small but vocal minority&quot; has become the majority, especially in Canada, and they now control every lever of power across the western world.
The whole‚Äôs government failed togetherness that didn‚Äôt blame‚Äôs to each others or tried to acting all of you all is smartest than me.  You can doing yours own writing of you agendas of yours speeches.  How much more you can do in the future‚Äôs.  Therefore, I did asking you all steps down.  Im values myself as the women‚Äôs respectful with dignity and prides that no men‚Äôs to meet my standards or compare of what I‚Äôm doing to each other‚Äôs.  If I can spending all my times just open my legs that how I‚Äôm have times for my business. Anyways p, I did have someone‚Äôs loves to each waiting for me that why I needs to thinking open my kegs in publicly?!  If you got the wife‚Äôs that you expecting she can open her legs to publicly then qualifies be your wife‚Äôs that I will said good luck.
Furthermore, women‚Äôs always wants compares with men‚Äôs is so unfairness that you always work less than the men‚Äôs that I seeks in Canada or others countries.  Men‚Äôs always born taught by parents must be takes cares of responsibility of families but not the women‚Äôs.  If just talks not proven with facts or evidence to proves who‚Äôs you are?!  I‚Äôm did everything that claims my rights at all kinds that never had another‚Äôs woman‚Äôs can achieves again.  You think of you can then pores yourselves immediately not just said not do as am done every steps away as well.  However, mist of men‚Äôs thought theirs smartly that as Canada governments all men‚Äôs can‚Äôt achieve one thing to claims theirs the professional certificate‚Äôs or permission with license!  It‚Äôs not every men‚Äôs the same stall.  That‚Äôs why the Canada women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs all failures shows to the public‚Äôs as always.
He did that I knew but because peoples depended to his answers so much. As other‚Äôs professionalism did made wrongful ideas; but once the knowing of knowledge actions that as you two shares ideas as professionals together between then problems will resolve times will fast to correction with understood.  If I‚Äôm always rights that I feels it‚Äôs this world‚Äôs without me is no one can replace that I had to contact Joe‚Äôs to reconnect with everyone‚Äôs that I can shares with outside of Hong Kong.  No one dine things single handed.  If I without Hong Kong worldwide business helps that I won‚Äôt be have enough times to achieve of my goals as well as theirs goals earning the worldwide business as frontlines success as the gmail before no matter what happened during the pandemic still I did appreciate of them all with my loves.  Mistakes must be happened or happenings but handles with the teams resolve fast than holding onto is not the solution at all.  In publicly that you all as the teams must be binging out the problems to each others without hides as stepping others back is not worthy and if acceptable advise must be required as sane teams without any conditions as country‚Äôs names of the flag‚Äôs divides between looking out to each others.  That‚Äôs the government‚Äôs did for the country‚Äôs flag‚Äôs not yo honorable of who‚Äôs the success admirer of the success celebration together.  As Sam business but different types conversions still can educate togetherness to looking out each other‚Äôs.  As I said you can adopts of other‚Äôs business that‚Äôs as Allen‚Äôs told me that you‚Äôre not just all that; then made me feels I can shares with him with honors to respectful to each other‚Äôs all times after I left him that I still remembered what he had been said to me of my ability not to giving up at all.  Peoples might thinking of him is not qualified as my husband‚Äôs but in reality that how much can qualifies of themselves of jobs and responsibilities of relationships as well.  The women‚Äôs thought of themselves can be more that I can tells you that a lot of women‚Äôs is delusional treaded themselves and business not as Hong Kong women‚Äôs not as women‚Äôs here‚Äôs that most of my girlfriends is single that it‚Äôs not theirs not loves but theirs living the life‚Äôs always equally as men‚Äôs and no scream or complains so much that they‚Äôre don‚Äôt have times to during fights and arguments instead business is the most important servings skills independence needs to require of to ours life‚Äôs.  They still loves to others but not to tells as theirs private life‚Äôs.  They still a women‚Äôs but nit after the sexual harassment allegations is impossible happening every days as acting you‚Äôre most beautiful persons using sex harassment to improves you beautiful or attractive at all.  Acting onto me as I‚Äôm the ones not worthy to be loves by anyone‚Äôs even I‚Äôm not beautiful and old.  Loves is not going by only sexually only.  During Allen‚Äôs and myself of the relationship‚Äôs that he did always made me feels I‚Äôm worthy with him that‚Äôs more than enough.  That‚Äôs ours privately business as well as you as women‚Äôs can‚Äôt shares to the world‚Äôs.
Whoever p, the peoples wants to be me that it‚Äôs difficult that they‚Äôre not purely Chinese with my families as well.  How can theirs said or writes as am today‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs difficult to written as am the stylist and difficult to follows at all.  If I write must be different looking ways and my answers always had the facts of each things happening.  Even you thought of yourselves understood how it write but when peoples reading it is different totally.  My grammar and times that you can‚Äôt followed.
I will considering of Trump‚Äôs of the position in US that with Biden‚Äôs and Pau‚Äôs joining government by the Universe appointees and goes by theirs each one of the experience had that will be the perfect teams for benefiting of the citizens l. Canada that must be removes the exiting government and let Stephen the leadership‚Äôs with Peter ‚Äòs the army‚Äôs skills that will helping a lot as the police‚Äôs must be following the rules of laws to do so.

I love Dr Peterson for a lot of years now. I love his genuine love for fellow man. I trust this man and I love listening to him speak. Jordan Peterson, you rock man!
Blessed with an amazing mind a clean heart and a healthy soul that takes and toerates so much unfair plus misdirected abuse and disrespect. A REAL MAN, A TRUE GIFT TO US
YE  if u eat  fukcing cake probably borring , but  what if u try  street skating or climb fucking everest , or expend into space , trust me ther are a lot of better problems to have then discriminatinon famine and shit that we can get rid of
The gender stuff seems true based on life, but it&#39;s pretty hard to separate nature and nurture if we zoom out though.
Jordon, a note on your critics.  People are driven by 2 forces. Light or dark. God or Satan. There is none other. Those attacking you are inspired by Satan. He will send anyone he can to attack you and stop you from spreading light. Do not give them a piece of your mind or heart. You are on God‚Äôs errand. Pay no head to Satans followers.
The dialogue between Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson always offers so much to think about! On my channel, we also delve into these intellectual conversations. Feel free to drop by and share your thoughts!
As a 79yr old woman, who brought up two sons alone, (now 50&amp;52),  I wish someone like JP was prominent when they were teens back in the 80‚Äôs, it would have been such a help. Thank you Jordan for what you do today!! üëèüëçüôè

Hillsdale College¬†is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women ‚Äúgrateful to God for the inestimable blessings‚Äù resulting from civil and religious liberty and ‚Äúbelieving that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.‚Äù It pursues the stated object of the founders: ‚Äúto furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education‚Äù outstanding among American colleges ‚Äúand to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.‚Äù As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains ‚Äúby precept and example‚Äù the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.",90020,3037,309,2023-06-20T04:05:00Z,"We humans are comprised of mind, body, soul and spirit.

What a wonderful idea: for Larry Arnn and Jordan Peterson to have a conversation. WOW!
Great introduction!
re: &quot;Every person is responsible not only for everything they do, but also for everything everyone else does.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve read about some experiments that purportedly showed that if mice or chimps in one place are presented with a problem to solve, and they learn how to solve it, mice or chimps in another place in the world, who are subsequently presented with the same problem.. will take much less time to learn how to solve it. It doesn&#39;t always happen, but supposedly it happens at a substantially higher frequency than it does if the second group is presented with the problem before the first group learns how to solve it. <br><br>This would seem to fairly strongly suggest what many of us have long suspected - that living things are all connected. And to a substantial extent we take our queues from each other. Consciously or unconsciously, one way or another. Potentially across large distances.<br><br>So, yes. If you make some bad decision, this increases the likelihood that someone else somewhere else also will. And if you make some good decision, that also increases the likelihood that someone else somewhere else also will. <br><br>If this is true, then it would seem that we are, in fact, our brothers&#39; keepers - whether we like it or not. <br><br>If you don&#39;t like the idea, and you decide not to believe it without really checking it out and actually suspending your bias against it, you may be living in a fantasy world.
The pejorative terms of nihilistic, narcissistic, psychopathology shows utter disdain for this group of individuals, who by the very nature of their pathology, unconscious and unaware! of the traits in their character, therefore they&#39;re unlikely to see üëÄ or seek to change, especially as often time&#39;s they are seen as successful üëç gifted or self-assured people...<br><br>Trying to convert the &#39;godless/unconscious&#39; to god is a waste of resources, but enlightening folk&#39;s to the existence of such individuals may help or support an awareness a conscious awakening!<br>Moralising or evangelising Immorality is futile!  The unconsciousness of the Zombie allows it/them to walk/talk blindly! they&#39;re unable to comprehend &#39;meaning&#39; moral or trans-c-ended because they are caught in the delusion!

&#39;Yeah-waaa&#39;. Must be Alberta Hebrew.
Love thy neighbor?  Jordan missed one, a very important one: Hitler protected a single Jewish doctor who was in his family&#39;s past.  Out of 5 - 7 million murdered Jews; Hitler went out of his way to save this one.<br>Why?  Because this one showed compassion when he was treating Hitler&#39;s dying mother by treating her for no charge as they were desperately poor.  Hitler went on to say that if more Jews showed compassion like this doctor; there very well might not be a &quot;Jewish Problem&quot;.<br>How about: By loving our neighbor, who knows but that we very well may avoid another Holocost.  Sounds like a good deal to me.
I am incredibly grateful to be able to listen to these conversations!<br>Grateful for Dr. Peterson&#39;s influence in my life.
Great podcast!
I love this man as if he were a member of my family.
I wanna know who Peterson&#39;s tailor is... classic old school cigar smoker&#39;s
How dare Freud label humanity as primarily sexually oriented based on  his dealings with just hundreds of abnormal patients ?
I am so very grateful for Dr. Peterson. (y&#39;all forgot to include the &quot;Dr.&quot; by the way.)
What would Socrates say about modern Teachers&#39; Unions?
Miserable man.
Dr Peterson, your posit that everybody has a stake in this world and has the ability to change it by changing themselves first (Thanks Dr. Jeung for borrowing from Torah), isn&#39;t a christian notion, it&#39;s a Jewish notion.  Our purpose is make a home for G-D.  And may we merit this prospect speedily in these days.

To call you primitive is an insult to primitive people!!! Is the most awesome quote I ever heard!!!!
ü§îI think by &quot;there is no difference between you and me&quot; he meant that we are in a society where its practivally impossible to avoid someone so when you hurt someone else they will get mad and hurt you back and you cannot really evade that backlash - even if it doesnt come from the individual the societal rules will ensure you get a aequialent backlash , simlarly treating someone positively will improve your societal standing<br><br>(because when jordan peterson says &quot;in the final analysis&quot; you better go a few metaphorical levels deeper than usual ^^)
‚ÄúYou can either lift up a cross or have one dropped on you‚Äù - JP
quote of the year: &quot;you know how i got protesters to stop showing up at my events?...i held them in the morning.&quot;    Absolutely priceless!
Love Aims to Make Things Better<br><br>What is the spirit that both animated the hand of Jung and Peterson?<br><br>Do you believe that when you&#39;re animated by the Spirit of the Lord, you speak on behalf of the Lord?<br><br>Is the highest order of self the voluntary self-sacrifice of the now for that better-desired future that helps everyone?<br><br>To this, Larry Arnn replies, that we must do more than think, we must do. That &quot;each has to make his own.&quot;<br><br>To begin, decide to carry something heavy. It may be the spirit that calls one to adventure. Then, grow from grace to grace until the necessity arises for you to be partial and eventually fully animated by the Spirit of Christ.
Peterson in a nutshell: Women do nothing wrong, men do everything wrong, and men need to cater to the needs of women or else they are man-children and arent real men <br><br>Peterson cultists and normies with average to slightly above average IQs: &quot;OMG! Hes such a genius!&quot;
always a great conversation with Jordan Peterson
You gotta love this man, I always feel both confronted and inspired to be wiser when I listen to JP

It&#39;s from the embodiment of pure and unadulterated cynicism that I know the truth about the goodness of cynicism and the evil of bitterness. Cynicism is being able to not be beholden to the ignorant side of the opinions of others. Sometimes people&#39;s opinions are rooted in truth, and sometimes people&#39;s opinions are rooted in bitterness. You can&#39;t be beholden to the opinions of others unless you want to be tyrannized by arbitrary bitterness. <br><br>If there&#39;s one thing about your shadow, Dr. Peterson, that I can&#39;t logically trust, ever, is that you seem to have fetishized bitterness as though it were some type of good instead of the stupidity that it is.<br><br>Cynicism, on the other hand, is free from the tyranny of bitterness and cynical people tend to celebrate this freedom by celebrating life. And btw, pain isn&#39;t a nature. Pain is a condition. It&#39;s an illusion. It&#39;s the bitterness underneath the pain that you thought was real. It&#39;s the bitterness that animated the pain. But pain in itself isn&#39;t real. It&#39;s just another lie. And it&#39;s the last lie that bitterness tends to want to believe. <br><br>That&#39;s why cynical people have fun and celebrate life. It puts a wise Epicurean beyond the reach of self-righteous and bitter hypocrites. <br><br>I do things because it feels good. That&#39;s why you enjoy jealousy, Dr. Peterson, not for any righteous reason. You just like the way it makes you feel something, instead of nothing at all.
Because I know your assumptions regarding ethical splits and my clear and perfect perceptions I&#39;m capable of always telling you what you expect to hear and what you want to believe because of your predisposition to looking for a lie you can feel comfortable believing. That&#39;s the shadow of love that I can play very well.<br><br>It&#39;s your feeling of importance and a desire to be loved that is your number one weakness and is your eternal weakness to wanting to believe lies rather than the truth and is the source of my cynicism.<br><br>If you don&#39;t believe in love then this is something that&#39;s a problem for you no matter where you go, because no matter where you go, there you are. You can&#39;t fight through the lies you live to get to me, because to be near me requires you to live honestly. <br><br>In fact, the only way Eros has any power over me, it&#39;s to keep me authentic, nothing more and nothing less.
I am curious, when Christians call Disney &quot;woke&quot; for making the Little Mermaid black, what is it called when Chrisitians make Jesus white?
Amazing conversation, Jordan Peterson hit the nail on the head in this one.
I enjoy listening to this type of conversation and i learn so much
We are haunted by demons and gods? The black wave of occultism was Jung perhaps. Peterson is arguably as crazy as the wokes.

Unfortunately for a strong healthy society to survive long term, it has to have boundaries and historically societies that over time, remove such boundaries fall apart and weaken to the point of self destruction.  Boundaries are there for a reason!  Once you focus on the depraved desire/rights of the few, against the strong moral code/rights of the majority, then that society is guaranteed to be doomed!  This is the beginning of the end for Western society with its age old morality, the glue that kept us intact and the ability to flourish!  This slowly started post WW2 and has speeded up exponentially since 2010.  Added to that China and Russia are monitoring the West with glee, at the demise of our own self destruction.  If these powers wish to invade in the next 50 years, it will not be an invasion ultilizing their great military might;  no not at all; they will just walk in, unhindered!
I call these people weak. I was mentally and physically abused quite literally from birth. I was small but gifted athletically, smart and strong.. I never complained or cried when injured. I was comfortable alone as I was in a crowd of people. I was never &quot;officially&quot; designated Captain in any team (because I was short) but everyone knew (including the opponents) I was it. But it never bothered me, I picked my battles, the ones mostly likely for me to win. And took on at times some more difficult to win.<br>Whiners and non-legit complainers were always looked down upon as they should be. And despite all the horrible things done to me by that biology guy, I never ran to drugs, drinking, smoking or became a bully I simply rose above it all and told myself that all negative things he said about was false. That he was talking about himself, not me. <br>And yes, people called me names and tried to put labels on me, all of which were never able to stick because it didn&#39;t bother me. A name or label can only stick or hurt if you ALLOW it to stick or hurt. Otherwise, it a word without teeth, a label without glue.

I would have started transitioning at age 7or 8  if only this education was available...as there as many kids who grew up feeling the opposite gender or known as Two spirited, not having the education I thought I was crazy , that it was some fantasy that I wanted or felt a girl as I was the best at being a man you could be I liked women sexually I knew that , girls liked me , I knew other boys didn&#39;t feel like a girl maybe their in touch with their femininity but certainly a boy, it is a spiritual path is evolution of spirit, two live two different genders is a gift. There&#39;s only male and female transgender would be the closest variant, yet it is still female or male in the universe. Only 2 % of the population is truly transgender, it&#39;s not the wrong body yet without hormones it can certainly feel that way it is pure torture, feels so disoriented. There Have always been transgender ppl since Sumerian Priests, these kids are highly intelligent and alot of more Bois and girls are androgynous in nature as consciousness evolves, there&#39;s been a shift happening for a while energetically work a lot more women are experiencing their masculine side and a lot more men vice versa or experience experiencing her feminine side which can create some confusion especially at a young age there is a lot of disinformation out there and I believe there is also some weird agenda at play like there are people transitioning who are not transgender and then there&#39;s places trying to take away healthcare for transgender people who never had any to begin with like a lot of people are transgender don&#39;t even you won&#39;t know because they&#39;ll just kill themselves so let&#39;s just be a suicide and you would never know. Beautiful thing to be transgender. With time people and perceptions in a society change , this is simply responding to the growth in rights and availability, it&#39;s kina crazy how they will just hand them out practically when it used to be very challenging getting hormones, I feel many men and women will be de transitioninf years to come yet there. Are many LIVES being saved with the education for ability to change  ,this is basic information that was supressed and labeled as a mental disorder in the medical DSM diagnosis...

Literally NONE of what Peterson is saying is correct.
Sixty years ago when I was four, my dad kept calling me a lesbian. He said I couldn&#39;t play with dolls properly. I liked to build things and had a business selling pollywogs. He hated me. He always bullied me about not being girlie enough. My parents always dressed me cup in ridiculous girlie dresses which I hated. I always hoped I would become a lesbian. But It didn&#39;t happen. I am stuck being heterosexual. I like being a woman now because all my relatives are dead. My boyfriend still says I am beautiful. I still build things, go fishing, and enjoy rough sports with the guys. My point is, this is nothing new. Dads were never satisfied with their daughters. They hate girls. They will always hate females. You know it&#39;s true.
The woke pandemic is more dangerous than the COVID pandemic.
Truth.
I am a diagnosed schizophrenic and I rarely am given the benefit of the doubt.  I felt really marginalized by most of my woke friends when we were of college age because I took a more politically moderate stance and they just couldn&#39;t get over themselves. I understand the desire to shake things up but they expected me to take responsibility for being a straight, white, male and I&#39;m not even sure what that would look like.  Like I am supposed to stop thinking for myself. That&#39;s not revolution, it&#39;s just using the same tactics as the powers they&#39;re against, just for their own different more radical agenda. And then they always resort to rage or just calling me a bitch which is just so unthoughtful, and they do it to enough people and wonder why people like Trump get elected when it&#39;s time to vote.
Desperate for identity and yet  too lazy to think for yourself. M&#39;erica!!

So I&#39;ve learned If you go to hell you&#39;ll have the absolute worst demon punishment You can ever imagine and that is how new demons are created with about thirty years of insanity and zero thoughts of your life ever again, It&#39;s actually worse but it&#39;s hard to explain If you want to try and understand you can try to ask the demon angels they&#39;ll probably tell you if your spiritual Senses are high enough to talk to them in your head or Use a pendulum and be very professional or You can use substances, The best I found is tramadol I think any opium would work, Alcohol/weed isn&#39;t good enough, but be careful<br><br>I also found out that you can make The angels if you torture them enough to call their supervisors which after 2 or 3 should get you their demon God on Earth which can&#39;t leave Earth and can be infinitely manipulated by regular demons like lilith because they are so unintelligible, Which means they can force them to give them their energy and then banishing them, causing an infinite loophole of free energy for demon life, Which they love and will give you anything they can
Totalitarianism, that&#39;s the spoiler
USA has always been a hotbed for psychologists, psychiatrists and general pandering to dredging up all their feelings.  Prince Harry is a classic example of someone who has been caught up in &quot;the couch routine&quot;.   It would be interesting to see how many psychologists commit suicide and have failed marriages.  Stop looking back and digging up old graves (which everyone has) and move forward.

JP gave Jung a bad look.
How does he know it‚Äôs BS? These types of people are just professional whiners, and criticizers.
The DNA thing Peterson proposed is truly preposterous. Dawkins is right in calling BS
Was this before Richard went on JRE? He acts like he doesnt know him.
The LSD remark is used to discredit the validity of anything that preceded it. However contrary to being ridiculed, the point is valid as anyone attempting to explain the essential truths of life should try to experience as many forms of reality as possible. It is the arrogance of primates such a Homo Sapiens to believe that the limited aperture of our senses can experience ontological truths about reality. <br>Richard Dawkins would be forced to question his limitations only through the ‚Äòparticipatory‚Äô knowing rather than ‚Äòperspectival‚Äô knowing about altered perception. <br>But this is the arrogance of man ‚Ä¶ the audience laughs as they feel momentary power through condescension. This is the exact form of laughter that preceded many ideas that are now held as truths. <br>first they ignore you, then they laugh ‚Ä¶
They knew about DNA, but thought humans came from sperm (that&#39;s why it&#39;s called seed) and the woman was the earth the man planted his seed in.
Sir, you WERE ON JRE!!!!
You don‚Äôt have to be smug  Really. It‚Äôs so childish and unbecoming of you Richard.
Dawkins is an jntelligent but very sterile and arrogant man.
That blogger who is well known. I aspire to throw this much shade üòÇ
I always say that Jordan Peterson say bull shits asll the time....
I do love JP but some of his takes screech of pseudo intellectual. Some of his discussions with top physicists they are left wondering what the hell he is talking about.
You know why Dawkins brings up that snakes thing? Haha, because there is nothing else in their conversation would give him in this intellectual exchange of thoughts. JP is an extraordinary intelligent and deep and Dawkins hates to look weak in the intellectual debates.
Dried up old fart does have his acolytes.
So awesome üòÇ
Russell Brand made Dawkins look pretty shallow imo.
Richard Dawkins is very limited intellectual as soon he moves over to the room of philosophy and questions as origins of life. William Lane  Craig is better there
Joe is very much right. Nice joke nonetheless.
whilst i agree with everything dawkins said, his tone feels  a bit mean spirited. both men invited him for interviews and seemed to be fans of him. maybe i&#39;m being too sensitive, but i feel like he could disagree without this mocking tone
what a lovely preacher and an admiring congregation.
I actually would love to trip on acid with Dawkins üòÇ
It looks like Dawkins is getting close to death.. He better get right with God
Thanks üëç
I greatly respect JP becauae he gets things wrong, like this topic, and when hes proven to be wrong he&#39;ll correct himself. Bot a lot of people are willing to do that publically
Sam Harris has very little knowledge about Buddhism and Hinudism. He claimed several times that Buddhism and Christianity are incompatible. His claim is absolutely untrue. In the deepest level, Buddhism and Christianity are in fact compatible. Buddhism is not atheist, even though Buddha never emphasized the idea of God, however that does not mean Buddha opposed the existence of God, and he was a atheist which he was not.
Mock what Joe said.  It is TRUE.  What Dawkins has experienced about consciousness is so limited.  I‚Äôll trust an astronomer with a telescope and a biologist with a microscope over one‚Äôs without.  That is what Dawkins is

Some very wise person once said: &quot;Whoever is attracted to psychology and makes this his profession has usually himself/herself a psychological problem he wants to solve or understand.&quot; Might well be. Would explain some of Jordan&#39;s strange deviations from reality in some aspects of his videos. I read that LSD is basically docking to the receptors of the neurons, after longer usage times permanently. Basically you will distance your mind from reality the longer you use it.
Excellent! Peterson is an Canadian embarrassment. Grew in northern Alberta - I‚Äôm told in an extreme right- wing community.
Joe may be dumb but he‚Äôs honestly dumb, whereas Jordan is a snake oil salesman
What are pompous arrogant, Self-serving self-important atheist. This guy is all ego and always has been. Speaking of, has been.....
As much as Dawkins pisses me off sometimes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather have him over those absolute morons
For those who don&#39;t understand humor.
That pretty much sums up JP and JR
Dawkins is so ignorant he cant even see his own ignorance. Lol
Richard Dawkins is AWESOME!!!! many years ago he inspired to make the decision to become an Atheist. and even though he&#39;s getting older now he&#39;s still a great person. I never cared much for Peterson and Rogan their just not my kind of people.
JP is a  great intellectual, but, yup, he is stuck in wishful thinking trying to make sense of it.
OG intellectual. JP and the others today dont even compare.
These atheists really have no respect for how much civilization owes to the spirit of superstition and mystical questions. I‚Äôm agnostic and atheism is a possibility to me but god do I hate the high horse these dudes sit atop of.

Logic ‚Äî so refreshing!
Growing up with a violent father who leaves in high school + Narc mom who calls you a mistake and grow up poor/financially crippling. After 18 you either have to support them and still get all the blame or move out dirt poor and live a feeble life. Somehow if you aren&#39;t depressed/suicidal you can work full time and go to school fulltime to survive and secure a future? idk
God didn&#39;t create us on earth for psychiatrists and psychologists to separate us into who is mentally ill and &quot;Not mentally ill&quot; or &quot;Normal&quot; WTF is normal??

I am blown away by this. For the longest time I wanted to see a psychologist. And the irony is I ended up seeing one of Jordan speeches where he talked about owning and admiting and ultimately facing your fear. I faced mine and all my worry literally evaporated. I also learned that when you have peace around one particular thing you are worried about, you&#39;ll be sure fire to find something else to worry about :) For me it was money and retirement. Once I sorted that, I started to have the problem of &quot;well, I need more for retirement&quot; :) Since, I&#39;ve learned to relax and know when I&#39;ve won.
Love the thumbnailüòÇ
why does he say complexity, why not the &quot;uncontrollable&quot; (or just feeling out of control?)? that would also include death, which is honestly not a complex thing. most mentally ill people I met (I had depression too) didn&#39;t have very complex life situations, often their life problems could have been easily solved from an outsider&#39;s view. I honestly don&#39;t get it. Most psychologists do differentiate between &quot;normal&quot; reactions to life situations and traumatic events and pathological ones anyway. I think accepting the uncontrollable (including the past which you can&#39;t change) is the key to heal.
Serotonin reuptake inhubitors.  Every mas shooter has a history of taking these
he thinks .. he does not know
Not finished watching this video, but already he&#39;s stated a point I&#39;ve been addressing to people: Many of the &#39;mental illnesses&#39; that we see today, are not a cause of genetic makeup, but are of a result of real life conditions. Some people have lots going on which even I may not be able to cope ideally with, whereas some just don&#39;t know how to.
The TRUE reason for almost all mental illnesses is that people have rejected God and have somehow had a demon enter them. &quot;Mental illness,&quot; drugs, and alcohol are all great ways for demons to act out from within a person and have people just pin it on something else, which enables them to hide and continue afflicting the individual and those around them.
Wow<br>truly wow<br>never thought of it that way before<br>great analogy and explanation as always from JP
He makes alot of sense
That&#39;s a great definition of why people seek suicide
im in that place, was**
As a person who actually has multiple mental illnesses including clinical depression, mental illness is a real thing that is genetic, not just caused by some kind of trauma or something. Some people have a chemical imbalance and it is as simple as that. It is harmful to people that actually have mental illness (that they can&#39;t help) to spread the idea that mental illness is something you can fix yourself, because usually it isn&#39;t. It isn&#39;t because their life is complicated, and I can confirm this because I am in a situation where I have absolutely no reason to be unhappy, but still am because of a genetic disorder. To anyone out there suffering, don&#39;t let anyone make you feel invalidated and your suffering is not your fault.
I‚Äôve always thought that considering a person to be irrational was very dismissive. It‚Äôs simplifying a person down to a level where you can entirely dismiss everything about them because you‚Äôre not willing to try to understand the rationale behind their decisions by assuming that there isn‚Äôt any. The rationale might not be good or justifiable, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that there isn‚Äôt some decision making process behind that person‚Äôs decisions.
And that&#39;s why Jordan Peterson once said: <i>you&#39;re not depressed... you&#39;re distracted.</i><br><br>I believe complexity in life comes with a side effect and that&#39;s being distracted, and being distracted adds more complexity to the present conflict. Talk about a vicious cycle. Very dangerous. A mind floating here and there, without direction, purpose, objective... full of transitorial, monotonous and time-wasting activities... will probably lead to a mental breakdown at some point.<br><br>It&#39;s a fact: people that know what they want (even if it&#39;s against the will of others e.g. family, friends) or at least are trying to find meaning <i>ergo</i> purpose with or without help (being easier with the first option e.g. having therapy) highly reduce their risk to develop mental illnesses.<br><br>In my opinion, depression and anxiety will be the main problems of the current century. More and more people feel empty, having monotonous lives leading to nowhere.<br><br>Maybe, just maybe... are we dealing with a growing &quot;social pandemic&quot; of distraction? <br>Living faster and comfier lives, surrounded by technology (sometimes too literally), could be contributing to worsen the problem?
Good to know!!! üå∑üå∑
Let‚Äôs go brandon üç¶üç¶üç¶
Wow. I never thought about things this way, but he has a very good point. Peoples&#39; brains nowadays can become completely overloaded, especially with all the CRAP going on in the world. Personally, when I get to that point, I completely shut down, because I can&#39;t even see where/how to begin to dig myself out of my out of control situation, i.e., job I despised, both parents became ill, had to fly home, parents got better, flew back, then one parent DIED, had to fly back home again, and deal with death and a funeral, plus the other traumatized parent; then flew back again, quit my job, determined I was going to MOVE home, so spent months packing and all of the stuff that goes with that; packed everything up, drove 1,000 miles home by myself. So I know it&#39;s going to take me a loooong time to decompress and come to grips with everything that&#39;s been going on over the past 6 months. Sometimes I think that just sitting and staring at a wall for a few days is preferable over having to deal with life. But I literally just take one....step....at....a....time. Suicide is NEVER the answer.
I don&#39;t like his spin on male/female issues because he shows a lot of misogyny stemming from his conservtive religious beliefs. But regarding &quot;mental illness&quot; , he is spot on! Especially when it relates to major depressive<br>disorder. <br><br>Complexities, pressures  in life, and overwhelm added to biological weaknesses which everyone has, will cause the biological collapse. That is not a mental illness. That is just putting too much pressure on one human. If family members die,  someone you love dies or is seriously chronically ill, and if you lose your job,  then you get financially buried, then you get physically ill.  How do you think the average person is going to handle ALL of that by themself?  He is a realist. Most psychologists aren&#39;t. They read the books they learned from and give out diagnoses. Wtf. Nature doesn&#39;t happen in a book!!!!!
can you remember Atta Muhammad?<br>Yes, you are right; the person who teach you unforgetable lesson
the leading cause for a mental illness is believing a lie.
I was about to comment on my own share of misfortunes.  But then I perused the comments and realize how really sad the world is for some people, how difficulties encountered in childhood can haunt us all the way into our adult lives, how terribly difficult it is to overcome, heal and comfort ourselves because everyone is busy trying to mask their pain or insecurities or too occupied with being an evil person. I pray you all get better, especially mentally and spiritually, to finally be free and make space for the wonderful opportunities of present moment.
Absolute shit childhood but believe in better learn to forgive and forget and be positive enjoy the gift of life as a journey to be the best version of yourself Pity  the greedy and corrupt whose lives are worthless .if you understand what i have written you are indestructible and all that is good can be yours  believe in yourself job done.
He made a profound observation. Complexity can push most of us to a breaking point.
Complexity is certainly not the cause; sin is. The Apostle Peter tells us about the &quot;conscience of sin&quot;.<br><br>This tremendous weight we all carry, some more so than others, can only be alleviated by repentance and faith in Christ. This is why Jesus says &quot;the truth shall set you free&quot; - He IS the Truth.<br><br>I can personally testify to this. Decades of clinical depression, and no psychiatrist, psychologist nor any pharmaceuticals could help. If anything, they exacerbated my situation. Jesus Christ however, set me free from guilt, and I was healed overnight. I have never had a depressive or anxious episode since.
There is no such thing as &quot;mental illness&quot; minds do not get diseased, therefore there cannot be a drug to fix it. Emotional and psychological problems are not medical problems that need medical treatment period. Psychiatry/psychology are pseudoscience and also dangerous to society. History has shown the destruction these 2 pseudoscience&#39;s have caused and history is repeating itself
Oh, such true...
I suppose this does track in my life. I was mostly very chill and motivated growing up. Then in college when my life became far more complex and I experienced some tragedies and faced the unknown, suddenly bam. Developed a panic disorder, general anxiety, and depression. 15 years later and I‚Äôve still never been able to get it under control and return to that more stable way of being that allowed me to be so successful in my teen years.
This is the Peterson gold, before he imploded himself. He doesn&#39;t look, act, or talk the same now. What a loss.
Im not a fan of JP. However I still watched to pick his brain, and at the end of his explanation of a troubled human being. He gives no solution nor , idea as to how that person can be helped. A very flawed intellectual.
Listening to morons like this is definitelyva leading cause
A mental illness is your incarnation knocking on the door
Guilt
Loosing family member or job is part of life, will you overcome it or let it crush you. Life isnt easy nor fair learn cope and dont shulk in.
I blame Mothers for most of your mental illness.
Fluoride is the main cause
It is uncool to blame technology on  the state of mental health in people these days. Sorry, but what I see around me is people, including myself, living a good portion of their lives staring at screens comparing themselves to other people on social media. This is in itself a factor contributing to a decline in mental health. I suspect it will get even worse once they sell us on the &quot;convenience&quot; of digital money and the benefits of A.I. in which case we not only will not be able to trust our human political leaders but not even know if what we are watching talk to us is a human or an advanced hologram. You want it darker? Looks like technology wants to take us there.

Well that makes me feel slightly better ü§î
It&#39;s not just complexity, it&#39;s a literal subjective distaste for certain behaviors or feelings. It&#39;s not an objective thing beyond the right to both suffer or feel ok
Peterson is an imbecil. People have mental illnesses, even if they aren&#39;t going through a problem. Trust me: A rich, healthy Borderline or Narcissist is STILL a BPD/Narc
Nope. Just nope. Too stupid.
People like JP contribute ti my depression. Says some great things AND THEN. Vote for Trump! A sexist, abuser, narcissist, manipulator, imbecile. Wow, way to help society JP. He only helps himself. He‚Äôs a loser. He‚Äôs mentally healthy only for himself.
Impressive how deep he goes into the supernatural while still denying it exists lol

We are actually in a cooling period in Earth. Not a warming. And any real and honest climate scientists and geologists will agree. He is talking about the model for scientific experiments.  They chose only certain things to look at and not considering &#39;all&#39; the factors. That&#39;s what he&#39;s talking about. Psychology is the study of the brain and responses according to conditions and genetics. Maybe if you actually listened with an intelligent mind instead of insulting him with your small mind and huge ego ...you could learn something deep and meaningful.
Jordan genuinely believes he has the knowledge required to talk intelligently about everything.
So essentially everyone SMN, GP, EM, etc are full of kaka, me included. I&#39;m just consuming all of this kaka while patiently waiting for death&#39;s final embrace.  Please, please everyone  keep bulllshitting away. xox
with the Monopoly bit - I love the last part where he&#39;s like &quot;this is the result of all iterative trading games when played to their conclusion.&quot;<br><br>Which sounds smart, until you realize that &quot;play a game to its conclusion&quot; means someone wins.  So yeah, if you play any game until someone wins, then someone wins.  <br><br>Tautological argument is tautological. <br><br>Fuck this guy.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSNWkRw53Jo&amp;t=1h01m34s"">1:01:34</a> a 0% unemployment rate is an exclusively progressive goal. No Treasury Sec. or Fed. Chair on either side of the aisle will allow it to approach 3% or less without then trying to slow down or even raise it, under the false claim that it&#39;ll &quot;lower rates.&quot;<br>EDIT: Jorby has a WILD misunderstanding of economics 3 minutes later. Someone read Kapital to this man.<br>2ND EDIT: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSNWkRw53Jo&amp;t=1h48m38s"">1:48:38</a> it&#39;s been over 4 years since Peterson refused a standing offer from Richard Wolff to debate Marxism &amp; economics.
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSNWkRw53Jo&amp;t=01h30m00s"">01:30:00</a>, he&#39;s really going to hype up the pure unbiased reasoning of the military and not mention that it wasn&#39;t desegregated until after WW2?  <br><br>I mean, of course he is, but still... fuck this guy.
Wait a second - that nazi&#39;s article about &quot;diversity&quot; in mexico - did he just mean all the non-white people in Mexico?
Not related to the topic at hand, but Cody has a real talent with his hand gesturing. It‚Äôs very engaging
It&#39;s funny that the only people that will watch 3h of this probably already think that Peterson is a depressed dogmatic bigot with verbal self-help diarrhea ü§£
peterson also uses the pareto principle to claim that women are always dating up and that 20% of men claim 80% of women. needless to say, incels LOVE this line.
I used to like him. Like a lot. He made some sense in a time in my life where I had questions and needed answers. Like how much the nazis hated the Jews to a point that they prioritized death train transports over everything apparently and so on.  Then, like a omen from the gods. A picture of him and a Pepe flag appeared and it‚Äôs like all of which that flag meant leached into him. Perhaps slowly at first but then it accelerated.
Damn. I came here to laugh at JBP (and I did, a lot), but when Cody mentioned Jordan&#39;s depression and addiction and cut to him crying, I felt kinda bad. As someone that went through years of depression and still ends up in occasional grey days some years after getting better, I sympathize with the struggle to keep your emotions at bay.<br><br>But that&#39;s the only thing that I will be sympathetic about JBP, his transphobic sophistic ass can rot in hell for all I care
Five minutes of this Video and it becomes clear what a Clown JP really is.
I cant link below, but for those that enjoyed this fantastic video, I highly recommend YouTubing Peter Joseph&#39;s review and analysis of the Jordan Peterson vs Slavo Zizek debate- excellent, humorous and very apt takedown of Peterson and a lot of the tired right wing bullshit he spews, in addition to his (often) poor critical thinking skills. It&#39;s as equally fulfilling as this video. <br>We need more seriousness, helpful and progressive solutions to real problems right now that affect the entire planet, as opposed to more right-wing grifters that have nothing new to offer and cause far more harm than good.
I must say it&#39;s very nice to be watching a channel and when a trans person shows up, Cody totally and uncompromisingly defends the trans people. Good job, Cody.
Why is the name &quot;Ellen&quot; bleeped? Not trying to make a political statement : just not American, and I don&#39;t understand.
Hierarchies of power lmao dude is in love with crustaceans. So many animals have serotonin receptors, what an insane take that we must have came from lobsters 300 million years ago. The guy really speaks like he&#39;s about to mix a cauldron of something.
On the lobster bit - I don&#39;t follow his argument.  <br><br>1. Lobsters fight<br>2. Lobsters who lose get sad<br>3. Seratonin makes sad lobsters energized/ready to fight more<br><br>therefore<br><br>Human hierarchy is natural?  Or good?<br><br>Did I miss a step?  Or does he just charisma his way through facts &amp; logic?
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
Made the egregious mistake of falling asleep to this because I dreamt of Jordan Peterson trying to debate me.<br><br>Nightmarish.
We&#39;d never have closed the ozone layer and we&#39;d all be burning up if we just said Climate is everything so lets do nothing.
more than 3 hours for a BRIEF look at JP.<br>you should make a 6 hour video for a brief look at Sam Harris.
Hey, instead of this positive feedback, echo chamber, why don&#39;t you go to one of his speeches and actually confront him?
Some things for Peterson are easy though: whatever he hates is simple, basic, shallow. Whatever he beliefs in is nuanced, complicated, deep.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSNWkRw53Jo&amp;t=26m48s"">26:48</a>   <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSNWkRw53Jo&amp;t=29m15s"">29:15</a>
The presupposition of Jordan Peterson&#39;s argument in relation to &quot;the Lobster Theory&quot; is that dominance hierarchies are biological traits, not social constructs. The precise details of the dominance behaviour are likely irrelevant in that broader context. Peterson‚Äôs point is that one can infer that such behaviour ‚Äî keeping a close eye on your position in a social hierarchy, was present in whatever common ancestor we humans have, with the lobsters, and from there on down to us. Dominance behaviour has been around for so many millions of years that it can be regarded as a sort of fundamental.<br><br>Is dominance hierarchies rooted in evolutionary biology? Or is it a social construct like many on the left suggest?<br><br>Well, lets take a look at primates. Human DNA is, on average, is 96% identical to the DNA of our most distant primate relatives, and nearly 99% identical to our closest relative, chimpanzees.<br><br>Using research from Japanese scientist Toshisada Nishida, renowned primatologist Jane Goodall, and renowned primatologist Frans de Waa; I have found that not only do chimpanzees engage in dominance hierarchies, but they engage in dominance hierarchies in a very similar way to humans.<br><br>Chimpanzees engage in war, live in strictly patriarchal communities, engage in politics, have a leader, use tools, make weapons, have social bonds, form coalitions, raid and ambush rivals, engage in hunting, engage and bribery, compete for dominance, develop territories, engage in border/boundary patrol, and create their own cultural traditions.<br><br>Not only are chimpanzees similar to humans in that regard, but they even share many of the same personality traits. Researchers at the Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Bastrop, Texas, found chimpanzees share 60 percent of their personality traits with humans: openness, extraversion, and agreeableness.<br><br>Some argue that aggression and dominance found in chimpanzees is not a result of evolutionary biology, but instead human inference. That somehow human impact drove chimpanzees to behave this way. But this theory is heavily disputed by a 2014 study titled &quot;Lethal aggression in Pan is better explained by adaptive strategies than human impacts.&quot; The study said, &quot;Variation in killing rates was unrelated to measures of human impacts. Our results are compatible with previously proposed adaptive explanations for killing by chimpanzees, whereas the human impact hypothesis is not supported.&quot;<br><br>The truth is, based on the research, it appears that Jordan Peterson&#39;s presupposition is 100% correct. Dominance hierarchies are biological traits, not social constructs. <br><br>As for Jordan Peterson believing that Serotonin plays a role, there is some very convincing data to support this.<br><br>Another close relative to humans is vervet monkeys. Dominant male vervet monkeys have twice the level of serotonin as subordinate monkeys. If the dominant monkey is removed from a group, and certain subordinate monkeys are given tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, or fluoxetine (Prozac), which increases synaptic concentrations of serotonin, the subordinate monkeys exhibit more dominant behavior (Raleigh et al. 1984, 1991; Raleigh and McGuire 1994).<br><br>I wish this video would have touched up on this rather than spend all of it&#39;s time mocking and misrepresenting Jordan Peterson. That would have been truly educational.
Ugh, came back to try again but no‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt listen to your non points. Sorry. You kinda suck, he kinda doesn‚Äôt.
I‚Äôm an electrician who installs solar panels on roofs and we have these things called harnesses that attach to this new device called a rope that helps prevent us from falling off roofs.    But thanks to JP for being worried about my safety and not using my potential death at work as a way to placate the oil billionaires that pay him.
I dare you to parody his interview with channel 4!!! C&#39;mon...  Do it! Do it! Do it!!!!
Nobel prize winners have done amazing resesech on climate change and discovered a lot but no, Peterson is right even if he can&#39;t disprove scientifically the data and the chemical equations involved in O3 layers being destroyed and CO2 raising the temperatures
His interview with Richard Dawkins is hilarious. Richard says &quot;what you are saying is utterly nonsensical&quot; or something like that while Peterson tries to argue about why mushrooms can make you see microscopical molecules like DNA. Dawkins was just baffled by such stupidity
It is so funny to see liberals absolutely loose their shit on a professional that defend young men by telling them that is totally normal and accepted to be men. Those liberal would  rather see a peado teaching child about dildos and a trans-terrorist shooting child - I am sure y‚Äôall were so happy when you heard about Nashville shooting
dude this fucking lobster speech had me cracking. wtf. also iam kinda glad videos like SMN exist and at the same time a bit concerned some people cant spot the fallacies in JP  arguments.
Man, this makes me hate the world the will become once chatJPT takes over
‚ÄúIn some sense‚Äù‚Ä¶.. ‚Äúlet‚Äôs say‚Äù‚Ä¶. I have strong opinions about a subject I willfully know disgustingly little about
Thank you for this thorough analysis!
It‚Äôs funny to me that the hierarchies that he is interested in defending are supposedly fundamental and permanent, but also happen to be the exact hierarchies that we‚Äôve set up in the past 100 years or so. <br><br>Like he doesn‚Äôt (openly) defend slavery or feudalism or genocidal hierarchies, but when viewed through his view that all hierarchies that arise are justified he should also defend them.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSNWkRw53Jo&amp;t=12m43s"">12:43</a>
Every time I have watch Peterson I‚Äôve wondered what the he!! is he talking about. Now I know. Thanks for the ‚Äòbrief‚Äô look into him. It was a lot of work I didn‚Äôt have to do and I really appreciate it. Seriously, Thanks.
The opinions and claims made in this video are nonsense. It&#39;s full of fallacies and biases. People in the comment section say that this is your best video. If this is your best video, then your other videos must suck. <br><br>Rather than accurately highlighting Peterson&#39;s views, you show a very short and out-of-context clip. You straw man his arguments, making it significantly easier for you to debunk. I&#39;ve read Peterson&#39;s papers, watched his lectures, and seen many of the full videos you displayed. Without a doubt, you 100% misrepresented him. You don&#39;t have the balls to debate him. He would first expose you for misrepresenting him, then he would spend the rest of the time intellectually eviscerating you. It happens every time. He makes everyone he debates look like a fool.<br><br>As for the lobster thing, when you accurately represent his argument, Peterson is right. The precise details of the dominance behaviour are likely irrelevant in that broader context. Peterson‚Äôs point is that one can infer that such behaviour ‚Äî keeping a close eye on your position in a social hierarchy, was present in whatever common ancestor we humans have, with the lobsters, and from there on down to us. Dominance behaviour has been around for so many millions of years that it can be regarded as a sort of fundamental. Given that, what Peterson says is 100% true. Believing that dominance behavior is socially constructed is absurd. You might not like Jordan Peterson, but he is correct that dominance hierarchies are found in common ancestral species. He is correct that it&#39;s a biological trait that goes back millions of years. <br><br>In Peterson&#39;s book &quot;12 Rules&quot;, he supports his account of serotonin and hierarchy by citing six articles on serotonin in lobsters and one survey article on serotonin and dominance in humans and other primates. His claim that increased serotonin in lobsters encourages dominance is true. The administration of serotonin to humans has a similar effect on social dominance. Humans who have been administered tryptophan over 12 days begin to exhibit an increase in dominant behavior (Moskowitz et al. 2001). When citalopram (a serotonin drug) is administered to human beings, these individuals are rated as more dominant by observers, and they also increase their eye contact when interacting with strangers (Tse and Bond 2002).<br><br>Conveniently your video fails to mention the various other studies that support Peterson&#39;s claim, you instead rely on your audience&#39;s ignorance to the topic. You are not the first person to misrepresent Peterson&#39;s Lobster Theory. Check out the link below debunking P.Z. Myers objections to Peterson&#39;s theory. Much like you, Myers misrepresented Peterson&#39;s position numerous times.<br><br><a href=""http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2018/04/jordan-peterson-on-lobster-hierarchy.html?m=1"">http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2018/04/jordan-peterson-on-lobster-hierarchy.html?m=1</a><br><br>As for those claiming that Peterson is dumb or a pseudo-intellectual, he is one of the most accomplished clinical psychologist in the world. Peterson obtained bachelor&#39;s degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. After researching and teaching at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 and became a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. With his students and colleagues, Peterson has published more than a hundred scientific papers advancing the modern understanding of alcoholism, antisocial behavior, play, emotion, creativity, competence, and personality. Peterson is one of the top 50 most cited clinical psychologists of all time with over 11,000 citations. He has an IQ north of 150 which puts him in the top 99.9 percentile of intelligence. So, it goes without saying, Peterson is not dumb or a pseudo-intellectual.<br><br>I think the creator of this video should be absolutely ashamed of himself. Those in the comment section should think twice about investing your time with someone who manipulate you.

From my understanding, I believe Jordan Peterson is saying there is a wage gap between men and women, but we have to look at the reasons why. Which I believe Jordan Peterson is saying, the wage gap is not due to sexism towards women. But because women choose lower paying jobs. For example, women mostly work in the industry of caring for people like day care, nurses, behavioral technicians, CNA.<br><br>If you were to ask a group of men and woman, which I saw someone asking people on social media: ‚Äúwould you choose a sewer job and get paid $100k a year? Or a lower paying job of 50k a year but you‚Äôre self employed‚Äù Most women, including myself, would choose the self employed job. Most men would choose that sewer job. Most Women would choose the lower paying job because of the flexibility of being self employed and most women do not want be in the heavy, laborious or dirty type of jobs.
Peterson is projecting I think. He is a very depressed and bitter man, he knows that (hence the episode with the benzos), but he is not willing to change, to do the work to actually become better, because its such a herculian task (like dealing with climate change) so he choses to do nothing.
I wanna point out that I like Jordan Jorbson üòÖ also enjoy analogy and I conceptualise the world in an analogous way. It&#39;s how I decompartmentalise. I&#39;m also neurodivergent and I don&#39;t mesh with the current order of the world and so I have the benefit of an outside perspective. <br><br>I think Jordan might also be that way and not realise it and oddly enough when you look at the world from the outside looking in he makes bit more sense. I do agree that a lot of his talking points are really quite draconian &quot;in some sense&quot; lol.

While completely true and valid, I believe Peterson&#39;s perceptions of good verbal exchange, assumes intelligence like his own. <br>Those of us, with lesser capacity,  are hard pressed to articulate what we believe, let alone, take an attitude of listening. Add learning, and exclude mere mortals.

I disagree when you say all good relationships are therapeutic by that definition.  &quot;Things are not acceptable as they are&quot; &quot;you want to talk about it&quot; &quot;you want to get better&quot;.  I think the first of those points is questionable.  What if things are fine? Maybe the purpose of the relationship is to maintain a  status quo that you are happy with.
Can someone please enlighten me about Roger, that he is speaking about. I really want to understand more. I would genuinely appreciate it.

Thank you, Jordan Peterson, and all of your family, for the courage and heart to continue to help people despite the benevolence marshalled against you.

Q&A is a television discussion program that focuses mostly on politics but ranges across all of the big issues that set Australians thinking, talking and debating.

It is driven by interaction: Q&A provides a rare opportunity for Australian citizens to directly question and hold to account politicians and key opinion leaders in a national public forum and Q&A is broadcast live so that not only the studio audience but also the wider audience can get involved.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences.

It‚Äôs impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we‚Äôre committed to giving participants a fair go.

In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

This is an official Australian Broadcasting Corporation YouTube channel.",12875754,139505,0,2019-02-25T12:51:25Z,,PT1H19M24S

your all speech has no sens after today&#39;s conversation.
yeah i said truth and what i get back?
This man&#39;s teachings saved my life and we&#39;ve never met.
Jordan Peterson.....A genious.......If talking was Intelligens.....ü•π
He&#39;s telling us to do what the people in power dont want us to. Tell the truth. That fact that the people in power are threatening us with brutal consequences for telling the truth tell us were are on the right track.
Doctor Peterson provides the honest,  accurate approach for bringing out the best in a person !  RESPECT !
As a psychologist, Jordan wants to control other people&#39;s minds, as he is certain he knows more about what is good for others, than other&#39;s know about their own lives. <br><br>Jordan is very transphobic, so he wouldn&#39;t agree with the following person&#39;s experiences. <br><br>From the book ‚Ä¶ The Transsexual Scientist ‚Ä¶ author ‚Ä¶ Dana Brevan <br><br>I was literally deep in the closet by age 5. From my parents answers I concluded that there was something wrong with me because I wanted to be a girl. I started to keep it a secret from my parents, my classmates, my cousins, my teachers and everyone else. I was trying to comply with my duties as a male and this was reinforced by the fear of being sent to a mental hospital. <br><br>About this time I first saw Milton Berle in drag on television. I was embarrassed to watch him in front of my parents. People were laughing at his attempts to caricature being a woman and I did not want to be laughed at in that way.
If you will be willing to consider yourself a part of a spectrum while assuming ALL traits within YOU are the spectrum you&#39;re using as a method to study YOURSELF, you&#39;ll be surprised how accurately you will find yourself to be part of a whole-along with those around you no matter who they are. And you don&#39;t need to pay a dime to finally be at peace with yourself as a whole as everything is freely availabe on the internet for you to search at your own free time and will. &quot;be the change you wish to see in others&quot;-do these steps for yourself and watch as YOUR world changes around YOU, despite hardships and TERRIBLE people you will meet along the way in your life time. Just take that leap of faith with yourself-FOR yourself. No one else matters when it comes to you improving your habits and lifestyle, you&#39;re the only one in charge of YOU at the end of every dayü¶ã
If you know that randomly things fall apart how can you believe in evolution ?
This may sound strange to some! The scriptures that says God Will forgive us 70x7 people use constantly and continuously as an excuse to do what they do!  That‚Äôs LIE and never learn what it means to tell the truth! Jordan your right Nobody Gets Away!
I am not a fan of therapists at all. <br>I think you are the only one <br>That provides real value  <br>with discrimination<br> to paths one can take. <br>Every therapist <br>should have to go through <br>Jordan Peterson university <br>Mandatory by law
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíØ‚úåüèæ
Dr. Peterson, I am 70 years old and I am going through a divorce from my husband who is very controlling. All you say still applies to old people but is there wisdom that is specifically for those who are retired and trying to find out the rest of who they are? Thank you if you answer this",PT11M33S

You can genuinely ask yourself if these words were reduced to the emotions and intent behind them, then what would they mean?  If you&#39;re trying to 1 up somebody, or put someone down, whatever... then you can think to yourself why.  Well maybe they are often rude to you.  Then you can ask something like: Well whats they best way I can handle a situation like this?  I feel like being insightful like this can be a good tool to help develop proper social skills.  I think at the end of the day, the more you know yourself and the more dedicated you are to stick to your moral values, the more well thought out you will become.
Is his suit coat two different colors??
Jordans so good at articulation it took me until 5 minutes and 5 seconds before i noticed the 2 tone jacket
&quot;what needs to be said will make itself manifest.&quot;
A VAGUE world also has  a purpose in our realm  of reality. Thank you Dr. Peterson  for your purpose.
A fascinating discussion, but to be honest I couldn&#39;t quite concentrate on Dr Peterson&#39;s lecture for the first few minutes because of his sports jacket! I thought that mind eyes were playing tricks on me.

Conversation is great...too bad most ppl want to do all the talking, not a give and take
I like what he is saying, but What the hell is he wearing???
JP is just a modern Socrates or Aristotle.
I can see that he has taught himself to act more reserved and not vomit out words anxiously like he used to. Can&#39;t tell if it is a strategic move to make him appear more masculine and respectable, or if he was just traumatized by all the haters and is now on the defensive.
Thanks for sharing 
The title of this video should really be &quot;Being Articulate&quot; instead of &quot;How You Become More Articulate&quot;. Note that about 80% or more of this video focuses on Mr Peterson&#39;s opinions and experiences on being articulate and why you should do so. The only &#39;hows&#39; in this video are to pay attention to what you say and to practise reading and writing.
What if you are excellent at this when writing but when you open your mouth your brain goes blank? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a social anxiety or if my thoughts and my mouth just don‚Äôt connect.
He says a whole bunch of nothing until <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTx7DV7sv8&amp;t=5m47s"">5:47</a> y&#39;all. The question was how do we become more articulate. 5 mins of rambling then the question gets addressed. My god
Interesting suit.

That&#39;s alot of words just for saying being articulate is a necessary skill if you desire to have things go your way, by being able to explain things in a way many people can understand LOL!!!!!!!!

What a lengthy video that doesn&#39;t come right to the point. Waste of time
people click button and boom, money.
Please!! ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone!!‚ö†Ô∏è Important question about what J. Peterson suggested!! üí• :<br><br>When he said that writing helps clarify thoughts and improve articulation abilities, is there a difference when doing it by hand or typing? Do both ways still develop these articulation skills or should we use mostly one over the other?<br><br>Thank you anyone for letting know your thoughts on that üôåüôèüôè
Read. Reading teaches you how to write. Writing teaches you how to speak. Speaking gets things done. Great video!
Ooh that‚Äôs a nice suit üòÆ
Why does he exclusively pinpoint this skill as imperative upon young men? Why not women as well? Speech is not only used by men lmao.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTx7DV7sv8&amp;t=6m34s"">6:34</a> bruh he‚Äôs so methed out that he had to show us how fucking blasted he is? Ridiculous, couldn‚Äôt even walk in a straight line üéâ

so far, I have figured out many skills  in my life but this one skill &#39;Articulating&#39; is one of the most important skills which makes you master communicator.

A person can be also vague and dangerous.
Functional articulation is not articulation that moves people, you have to pluck the heart strings. Functional articulation has a place for when you want to describe ideas in the clearest way possible to an individual that is already alligned to your cause. Someone who wants to listen to you, and wants to understand you.<br><br>But when you want to articulate to someone who does not want to actively understand you. You have to simplify things. You have to pluck their hard strings. You have to beautifully construct your sentence in a way that moves them. So that they want to understand you.<br><br>In its essence it is the energy that someone has to use to understand your point of view. How do you awaken this energy? How do you move someone in a way that they want to listen to you.
Wow, he had her speechless. Crazy. I think this is one of the times he had a host that was respectful.
Recognize the power of articulation: Understand that being articulate can make you a more effective communicator and enable you to convey your thoughts and ideas clearly and convincingly.<br><br>Pay attention to your speech: Be mindful of what you say and how you say it. Avoid using fillers like &quot;um&quot; and &quot;like&quot; and strive to eliminate unnecessary pauses or stumbling in your speech.<br><br>Choose your words carefully: Take the time to craft your words thoughtfully. Use vocabulary that accurately expresses your thoughts and feelings, and avoid vague or ambiguous language.<br><br>Practice self-expression: Write down your thoughts and ideas regularly. Engage in activities such as journaling or blogging to develop your ability to articulate your opinions and experiences.<br><br>Read extensively: Read books, articles, and other forms of literature to expand your vocabulary and expose yourself to different writing styles. Pay attention to how skilled writers structure their sentences and convey complex ideas effectively.<br><br>Listen actively: Improve your listening skills by actively engaging in conversations. Focus on understanding others&#39; perspectives and ideas, and practice summarizing and paraphrasing their points.<br><br>Develop clarity of thought: Work on organizing your thoughts before expressing them. Take time to reflect on a topic or problem and consider different angles and possible arguments. This will help you articulate your ideas more coherently.<br><br>Embrace pauses: Emulate the practice of pausing before responding to a question or proposition. This allows you to gather your thoughts, assess your true opinion, and respond in a more deliberate and articulate manner.<br><br>Seek feedback: Request constructive criticism from trusted individuals, such as mentors, friends, or colleagues, regarding your communication skills. Actively incorporate their feedback to improve your articulation.<br><br>Practice active articulation: Engage in public speaking, debates, or discussions to hone your ability to express yourself clearly and persuasively. Take opportunities to present your ideas in front of an audience, as it builds confidence and strengthens your articulation skills.<br><br>Strive for authenticity: Align your words with your values and beliefs. Be genuine and sincere in your communication, as people are more likely to be persuaded by someone who speaks with conviction and authenticity.<br><br>Be open to continuous learning: Recognize that becoming articulate is an ongoing process. Stay curious, remain open to new ideas, and be willing to refine your communication skills continually.<br><br>By following these points, you can develop and embody the qualities of an articulate person, enabling you to effectively communicate, influence others, and express your thoughts and ideas with clarity and impact.
I just want to point out that suit, it goes hard
What a great man
Peterson‚Äôs been killing it lately. No doubt he is fundamental in fighting the evil in our society today.
There&#39;s being articulate as a result of careful considered thinking and lots of reading.<br><br>And there is being a snake oil salesman charlatan who makes you think he&#39;s smart.<br><br>One guess as to what JP is, and the first one doesn&#39;t count.
As the guest of F√ºhrer Orban in the F√ºhrer Castle of Buda, Knight Impotent B. Peterson: <br>&quot;my message to the Hungarians: Do not rebel against your leader! Your leader is trying to restore the metaphysical foundation of the 1000  years old Hungarian empire<br>I would like to tell you a secret about Jesus and a secret about your PM. Another name for Jesus is Viktor&quot;
Well articulate: <br>1) ‚Äúwhen a plain cheese pizza‚Äù ~ becomes an instant hit.. everything about it becomes well articulated.<br>2) When Arts students listens to an science lecture without youning and are interested.<br>3) When the listener gets to hear a speech on which he doesn‚Äôt have any clue!! But needs to project intellegent; the speech becomes Articulated.<br><br>** if you can sell GARBAGE in huge quantities*** ~ you become well articulated.",PT14M23S

&quot;Is it possible that views become more attractive when the view highlights unfair treatment or withholding of resources?&quot;<br><br>No, it doesn&#39;t become attractive lady. That&#39;s not how propaganda works. <br>The only ones who see this as attractive are malignant narcissists who rejoice at watching downtrodden squirm when being brainwashed.

The right is racist, the left is not. Now, according to our nations short historic, well documented past; the democrat party (the left) was of slavery, Jim Crow, segregationist, black, anti Hispanic, until they became vote necessary pawns of the same parties interests.
While the madness is raging on on the &quot;social media airways&quot;, the WEF and their hand puppets are busy little bees. Tell us busy little bees, what are you buzzee with? (The oldest tricks in their playbook. Misdirection and deception.)
He‚Äôs so far out of her league. She should stay home.
Jordan is a beast and he has the receipts......
Dr Peterson if u ever run for. Prime minister you have my  vote. God bless u and your family.
The stock footage and captioning is so utterly xgen obnoxious. Give it a rest
fuck your clickbait titles, i can enjoy dr peterson&#39;s speech without them
Just another example of someone that knows what they‚Äôre talking about, versus someone arguing to prove their idiotic point.
What about the up and down , not the left and right, it‚Äôs the argument against collectivism vs individualism
Note that what is being pushed forward is actually selective equality of outcome. It is not even being applied at 360 degrees.
Protect this man at all cost!!!!!
When women are made equal , they become superior to man.  Because women are psychological invaders.
Rude and ignorant this woman is. Disgrace to the female species. No manners whatsoever ü´µüèªü´µüèª
&#39;Ra ial superiority&#39; does exist and cannot be denied by anyone who looks at the world with open eyes.<br><br>The real danger is what those who hold such views  (and have power) decide to do.<br>Not a lot and help where possible is OK<br>Other more awful alternatives not so OK<br><br>The problem with the first reponse is that the inferior may well obtain power by voting.<br>See Zibabwe and the ongoing downward spiral of South Africa.
I swear to God, every time she‚Äôs losing the argument she has to interrupt. But but but, how could you, you couldn‚Äôt possibly. She is so out of her league with Peterson‚Äôs intelligence she should shut up and learn something!
Interesting Peterson said men and women are pretty much alike but then said the extremes are what‚Äôs important. (Male violence). When is that ever a good argument? Don‚Äôt most people tend to argue about what is most common and not the outliers?
First time I‚Äôve heard Jordan Peterson. What I saw, he knows what he‚Äôs talking about. She was just grasping at straws, no real clue.
There‚Äôs a difference between equal and balance. People who wants equality can go to North Korea. Actions speak louder than words.
It‚Äôs easy for Jordan to have patience when he‚Äôs dealing with idiots. <br>Personally I don‚Äôt suffer then all to well
Why does a reasonable intelligent conversation between two people have to be labeled so stupidly?  He did not own anyone.  There seemed nothing particularly woke about her.  And she did not seem to try to cancel him.  That is all bullshit.   It seemed a calm intelligent discussion.   We should have more of it.  Inflammatory titles and click-bait help no one.
I like how they cut off the video when a woman started speaking of how easy they havit, they didn&#39;t even let her finish.
If the woman would just shut up and listen carefully to what is being said then maybe she would understand what is being said. Problem - she refuse to shut up and would like to push her agenda because she is not hearing what she wants to hear.
When did he own a feminist.<br>All he did was telling his point of view
I&#39;ve worked in large tool and die shops, with women that made the same as I did. When I was on a machine that stamped out 50 pound blanks, I was required to stack those parts, myself. All these women, to a one, cannot do this job, themselves. They always asked me for a hand...
How can the right ever go &quot;too far&quot;?  We&#39;ve literally never seen that.  Name one thing that was &quot;conserved&quot;?  It&#39;s only an argument of how far and how fast left everything goes and how fast society gets destroyed. That&#39;s it, plain and simple.
All hail the Lowest Common Denominator!<br><br>More alike than different: two fifty gallon tubs of drinking water.  Add 16 ounces of sodium chloride to one tub.  Are both still drinking water?
This woman keeps cutting him off while he‚Äôs answering the questions ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
She rather rudely interrupts him several times.
How can gender be a social construct of humans if almost every living insect, fish, and animal on earth,   who have no &#39;society&#39; , have male and female
Sickening liberal interviewers
She reminds me of my wife, just cannot hear logic, no matter what you say.
They all look like fools compared to him with agendas
If only the red head would listen, just listen
Feminism has become so toxic it‚Äôs disgusting, as a woman I definitely do not support their insane ideology.
It&#39;s not the questions, it&#39;s the disingenuous phrasing of the questions specifically designed to find a single thing to trip Peterson up on so they can scream that he&#39;s wrong on that single thing to the rafters in order to discredit him. I would have really enjoyed the scrutiny of this argument if the intent of the scrutiny wasn&#39;t malicious.
She&#39;s an absolutely terrible interviewer. I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s in journalism.
Who is the Native American girl at the beginning of this video? Her facial features express anger and resentment as she speaks to a Caucasian woman over feminist views. A shame, her natural beauty is distorted by a dedication to a destructive mentality.
That chick doesn&#39;t want answers, she wants to stir the pot. She wants to be an intellectual but she&#39;s just a phoney.
Whereas this equity delirium is the apanage of the left indeed, I don&#39;t believe (actually I <b>know</b> this to be untrue) that racial considerations are exclusive to the right.<br>Salvador Allende among many others was a racist (cf <i>Hygiene mental y delicuencia</i> ).<br>The right is nationalist, period. But it is fair to say that in the 20th century, some forms of nationalisms have found their expression along with racial focus.
Women who are anti-western man are going to have hard lives.
The left, not the right is abundantly racist! The nazis are a good example!
Once again, an ideologically possessed journalist glosses over the excellent points Dr. Peterson is making because she is in a hurry to  attack straw man statements. Sound familiar?
The talking over Jordan Peterson and especially the meandering of her opinions are nonsensical, pointless and infuriating. Let him finish a thought or statement.  She&#39;s simply rapid firing counter opinions without following through with a point or facts. To tell Jordan Peterson that he can&#39;t use his 40 plus years of knowledge and experience because she read an article is the most idiotic and infuriating. Typical.
Is there a version without the crappy background music?   WHERE does the compulsion come from to contaminate the sound track this way?  All we need is the voices!
There was a paper published in 2008 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology talking about temperament differences between men and women becoming most pronounced on average the more affluent and egalitarian the country.<br><br>These findings have been replicated by others. Even the Atlantic magazine ran a story on this phenomenon.<br><br>People can be skeptical, but their incredulity in matters of psychological expertise when talking with a clinical psychologist, whose job it is to know this stuff, is astounding. Especially, when junk psychologists whose narratives make no empirical or logical sense are believed. Like Dr. Valerie and her nonsensical notion of &quot;patriarchy stress disorder.&quot;
She abruptly interrupts him, very often, and I don‚Äôt want to hear her at all. Stupid woman fool, makes us all look bad
As usual, Peterson absolutely owns the debate üëçüèª
We now have woman in our heavy diesel mechanic repair workshop and man has productivity gone down. Cant lift this. Cant do that. Pulling the men off theirs jobs to help them. And then the chit chat starts. And their not even interested. They just want the social status of being something different. No interest at all.",PT8M26S

@sabretyger I hope you&#39;re still going
FATHER!‚ù§üéâüòä
Crearea karmei grele cu fundament istoric
How about if now your going into your fourties and your past has way of coming up again
Absolutely the best advice to modify your behaviors, thinking and life style. I needed this earlier in my life, but the question would have been... Would I use his word to my benefit. I may never know and neither will you unless you really and follow and put into action what Jordan Peterson says
I don‚Äôt know how to free my soul from my past, I‚Äôm 38 and have been so upset about my life since I was very young.
The worst part of depression and feel like giving up is the people around aren&#39;t understanding and supportive of you. When you&#39;re family and friends are in denial of how u feel by saying you&#39;re fine when ur not. I think the main reason for suicide is not having the help and support . Feeling alone through it all.
30 minute video every 5 minutes is an ad. Cmon man
We are under attack constantly in these modern times. I was reasonably happy until an eviction order was issued to me and turned my life into an anxiety ridden disaster zone. Life is truly a horror story. Good luck to everyone and kerp listening to Jordan
BLESS!‚ù§üéâüòä
My son was my purpose. He was the center of my world and my reason for living and thriving. He died suddenly and unexpectedly at age 13 from seizure complications in his sleep. We found him in the morning in bed, gone, and I tried CPR and mouth-to/mouth to bring him back. He had already been dead for hours. My hero and my best friend. He was so special and loving, I was under his spell. I really don‚Äôt know how to be happy and live life anymore. My desire for thriving is gone. I wanted to protect him forever. I even promised him that. It didn‚Äôt happen.
When he says there are extraordinary people who come about from time to time I automatically thought about tupac and Bruce Lee
What if no goal seems meaningful enough?
So sad to see the decline of Jordan Peterson from intellectual prowess to drug dependency. After his coma in Russia he became a Putin apologist. Such a somber path for one who once had such a sharp mind.
I used to think Jordan was so mean and judgmental, but he‚Äôs actually one of the most compassionate therapists out there. He has had personal challenges himself. He knows what it is like to suffer. He cares about people.
Yeshua Christ is the truth reach out, nothing but respect ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Thank you Jordan Peterson you‚Äôve helped me change my life around and to keep pushing when things get hard.
Side note: did any one notice the multiple times the Nintendo switch Joycon attach sound bite at random intervals?
Peterson lost himself man.. he use to be so helpful.
Im a women that bought up 4 kids most of that time alone. Iv lived in my home since my kids were little. They have gone 1 by 1. Moved miles away i cant afford to live in my home cause its not my home its rented. This is all i have ever know. My edlest daughter has to move because her mortgage has taken over there lifes . They gutted the house all loans all credit cause they had jobs . He wants to sell the house now. 2 brand new cars , large kitchen all mod cons. I have a decent house a decent garden. She went on and on to my son about why is he still living at home. My other son was dumped back here during lockdown having a breakdown. Because his ex and her mother decided so. I have never seen my grandaughter since. My daughtets son is a university being indurcated by transaenda agend this is the second time he has returned and my daughter told me he holds very strong political views on this. Well so do i . He thinks he can shout me down. He wont no whats hit him if he hears  mine.  I will over come all this. Best to block these people even if they are your own family out of your life. My youngest son will be next to go. Just as soon as he finds a new girlfriend with her own place. My daughters last text to me whiles i was in hospital as i have 2 bulging  disks in my spin and was in total agony. U are a vile and disgust person. I bought my brothers up i have 3 sons. U take after your mother vile and disgusting  she has been dead from 30 years . Sufferd terrible sexual abuse as a child. My little sister died and i had to grow up fast . My mum was un and out of mental hospitals for years . She killed herself in the end. Daughter or no daughter dont speak about what u choose to no nothing about. I will never ever speak to her again. That was my mum also and i saw everday from a child the pain my mum went through. I loved my mum and dad my dad was a good man they are dead im not.  So they can do and say what ever they like i no the truth ‚ù§
Jordan Peterson is such a blessing to all. I achieved success after I practiced the steps below.
What if you simply can&#39;t find anything  that matters done everything  lost everything  just don&#39;t careüòÖ
I was put on a 5150, 72 hr hold in the hospital for trying to kill myself im glad I found this I‚Äôve been losing hope in everything and everything just seems so pointless
I wanna give up so bad
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I was thinking of giving up, then when I discovered this useful video had some absolutely useless and clich√© music playing throughout, I DID. <br><br>Thanks!
I&#39;m planning taking my own life. I am only watching this to try to figure things out I&#39;m Thirty eight years old i&#39;ve worked very hard in my life to become What I am today. I&#39;ve been to trade school I have 5 certificates For my education but I find myself alone every night seeking love For which I find not even from my own family. It&#39;s hard to explain myself in a simple paragraph. And I doubt I will ever receive any information on how to overcome this life to where I can live it to the fullest to my Pencil. I know I will not find happiness in this life but how do I find peace?
Bro, I want to give up, because I already tried so fucking hard, not because I sit on my ass and don&#39;t do nothing or never did anything. I have a massive burnout. I think this video just isn&#39;t for me, but screaming at ppl that they should get tf up doesn&#39;t help with cases like mine. Always the same crap.
Whoever edited this video needs to pump the break a little bit with the background musicüíÄ.
Wish I could say this helped but it‚Äôs aimed for people who have a home and a chance of a job.  Not 70 y/o‚Äôs who have worked hard all their life and brought up a family only to be financially cleaned out and left homeless.  You know - proper depression!!  Believe me, no one will employ a woman of this age living in a car.
Only seeing this because my best friend took his life this week
God pleaseü•∫üò•I don&#39;t want to give up God please help me!!!!
Some people are not willing to continue living the way they are currently living so what&#39;s the alternative to that?
I know someone that&#39;s going through this horrible painful traumatizing  life....  <br>Where they want to schedule their lives and everything else but the internet crime won&#39;t let them do anything....<br>Than what can they do?
Jordan is a drug addict and lost his practice

Well, the Catholic church nearly destroyed Christianity, it&#39;s great that he&#39;s promoting the Bible
&quot;dont have positive emotion&quot; is that why i seek pain to feel anything at all?
Life is overrated

Giving ups the best thing I ever did.
I wish I can have a one on one appointment with you Dr. Jordan
I don&#39;t know if anyone truly appreciates undeserved reward. That is one of the deepest things I&#39;ve heard in a minute
after battling with trauma and mind games, I can&#39;t put up with crap and lies in business on a regular basis
Why shouldn&#39;t I give up on my hopes and dreams? Like really, chime in please and give me a reasonable argument?
I asked for strength and God gave me difficulties to make me strong.<br>I asked for wisdom and God gave me  problems to solve.<br>I asked for courage and God gave me dangers to overcome.<br>I asked for love and God gave me troubled people to help.<br>My prayers were answered.
We are rewarded (by the grace of God) for who we are IF we accept and receive Jesus the Christ (Israel&#39;s Messiah) as our Savior. Then we become children of God AND co-heirs with Christ.
‚ÄúWinners never quit, and quitters never win.‚Äù No matter how strong our resolve, sometimes we get frustrated and want to give up‚Äîwhether that happens at work, training for a big race, or even a relationship&quot; üòÉ
I was at a birthday party of one of my good friends last year, and he happens to be befriended with a couple of rich people. We‚Äôre talking about people who drive Porsche or AMG and by gifts from Prada or Louis VI, and buy high-quality cocaine. I tend to dress in what could be considered a rich and fashionable manner and these people thought I‚Äôm one of them, so we got along pretty well. I observed what they bought and how they spent their money, as well as what kind of life they were living, who they were living with, and what did life mean for them. I quickly realised that that was not the life I wanted. I‚Äôd rather work with people and get one or more thank you‚Äôs in the end of the day and enjoy a beer in the balcony with friends. I also realised that helping people move out of challenging situations or overcome addiction, stress or depression and getting the feedback in the end is way more rewarding than driving a luxurious car or being able to buy your girlfriend a Prada bag. That‚Äôs it.
Why is this all happening <br>Thank you but this is what‚Äôs happening when children is getting groomed in school  for the monastery luxury Scot free lifestyle of blood ü©∏ that kids has no living right or rights over his own life and that right is wrong and wrong is right for the monastery legacy to lie manipulate deceive hatred murder killing kidnapping grooming abuse torture raping women and children thanks to the most dangerous and evil thing there is in this world a Parent or Parents for letting this happen to the greatest privilege and honour a living will ever have in their life‚Äôs a child and instead of teaching<br>All living (human beings, animals, plants) is born perfectly ( not dum and stupid) equally and free against our will in a beautiful world ( not a country with a flag) that is given equally and free to all living ( not a man or woman or animal or pet extra but a living) to live their life‚Äôs and not to be groomed in schools right is wrong and wrong is right for demanding controlled slavery life for the monarchy or someone else‚Äôs luxury Scot free lifestyle No living is born¬† better then another living or to be better then another living No living has the right over another living life unless it‚Äôs for food or life wood or food or land he sleeps on and the living only owns land he stands on or sleeps on and the rest belongs to all living (human beings, animals, plants)and don‚Äôt do to other living you don‚Äôt want dun to yourself self it‚Äôs called pure natural born respect and care pure natural born happiness pure natural born common sense¬†<br>Thank you

Sir , u open my eyes to a new perspective about life
It is important to not give up on what we are doing to become better then before as we now that our past may repeat in future.<br>Be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect DR Jordan Peterson.When i did start watching your records, i remembered a man from time in past who reminded your outlook. All this life matter has given me a message that we are able to expierence things from past into future, like i was writting before, i am writting now.
Want to like what you&#39;re saying but........
Every time i try to move forward i get pushed back in some kind of way but no matter what we need to be strong enough to turn it into a positive and drive forward i feel if i dont il only give in forever and ive a little son who needs his daddy so whatever it takes im pushing forward drag me to hell il get myself out of there some way somehow.. it took jordan to remind me of what i am‚ù§

A Professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto, Peterson has received considerable media coverage after publishing a series of videos criticising the Canadian government's move to enact Bill C-16, which made misgendering a form of hate speech.  His recent bestselling book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos topped the Washington Post, WSJ and Reuters U.S bestsellers lists

ABOUT THE OXFORD UNION SOCIETY: The Oxford Union is the world's most prestigious debating society, with an unparalleled reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to Oxford. Since 1823, the Union has been promoting debate and discussion not just in Oxford University, but across the globe.

The Oxford Union is deeply grateful and encouraged by the messages of support in response to our determination to uphold free speech. During our 200 year history, many have tried to shut us down. As the effects of self-imposed censorship on university campuses, social media and the arts show no signs of dissipating, the importance of upholding free speech remains as critical today as it did when we were founded in 1823. Your support is critical in enabling The Oxford Union to continue its mission without interruption and without interference. You can support the Oxford Union here: https://oxford-union.org/supportus",10933196,116314,15083,2018-06-24T17:00:06Z,"Sehr temperamentvoll, was ein wenig im Widerspuch zu dem moderaten Inhaltlichen ist, aber ein top talentierter Mann.

When i saw Jordan Peterson full address I thought this was a call to arson
In the US, there are no laws outlawing the most insulting word you can think of. But the social costs are so high that it prevents most people from committing transgressions of that sort. Over time, it works. But not perfectly.
I can only admire and always be mesmerized by the towering genius of Thomas Sowell.
Thank God there are some intelligent students at Oxford who can sit and listen to a speaker and engage in sensible debate.  I was starting to think there weren&#39;t any.
JORDAN LEARN FRAMING
I would argue that Jordan spends too much time flopping his &#39;linguistical intellectual dick&#39; when he speaks to audiences; I think that he uses too many unnecessary &#39;high-level&#39; english terms which the &#39;average&#39; human being is unlikely to know the meaning of. In all fairness in this video he is speaking at Oxford Union and so maybe in this case it is just down to my own lack of linguistical intellect, but I would argue that he does what I am calling &#39;linguistical intellectual dick flopping&#39; with audiences of &#39;low&#39; or &#39;average&#39; linguistical intellect too. I think that his way of speaking inevitably leads to people losing track of what he is talking about, and that if he wants his audiences to gain more value from his &#39;average speech&#39;, he should lower the linguistical intellect required to understand his average speech.<br><br>I would possibly refer him to his own words after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZMIbo_DxJk&amp;t=13m16s"">13:16</a> &quot;and maybe there is a rule of thumb which is never use a high resolution theory when a low resolution theory will do&quot;. I am not talking about theories here, but I think the meaning carries over. I would argue that he could use &#39;lower resolution&#39; language at times while still containing the full essence of his arguments. I hope that if pressed, I could enumerate a few cases where he uses unnecessary &#39;high-level&#39; vocabulary which I claim will possibly &#39;ruin&#39; the speech and confuse the &#39;average&#39; audience
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZMIbo_DxJk&amp;t=13m22s"">13:22</a> the converse is not true based on my current logic. either my current logic is wrong or Jordan&#39;s is
It was a pleasure seeing students allow a controversial figure to speak and express his views and challenge him with intelligent questions.
The most articulate caveman I&#39;ve ever heard.
While I think the &quot;Woke&quot; thing has gotten a bit ridiculous, Peterson&#39;s reaction to it says more about him than he&#39;d want anyone to know.  Jordan, you&#39;ve got some issues to deal with.
I&#39;m amazed at how many people get sucked in by this guy. I guess if trump can do it, Peterson certainly can.  I&#39;d like to see him in a tutu performing swan lake. Lol!
Answer to lady&#39;s question about the origin of meaning according to Peterson: survival.
Dr. Peterson just opened up a new world for me.  I now perceive world issues in a different framework.
Fascist bigot and common drug addict. That&#39;s JP.
His talk on hierarchy, when he spoke of people having something to loose, I feel the would help the black community so much. Many of them feel they have nothing to loose whether by their own choice or not. Not having anything to loose leads chaos.

Who defines hate? This guy doesn&#39;t know whose country he came into
It&#39;s kind of neat that first he gives a lecture about tribalism, and right away in the next sentence he praises the tribe of the audience (appeals to the tribal feelings of shared culture of the audience ,(The Brittish  )
Damn , this gives such a great picture of JP . Every critique of him should see this.
We have to watch closely the developement of  his career.. As he is getting fame he might get more power also. I can imagine him as a new overlord of Humanity (Big Brother ). Of such a force is his clearminded message in this crazy age of the ppl&#39;s separation of Reality. Luckily he is so old so he may not have time for that.
JP is an intellectual liar, and an insult to intelligence, once I respected him until I realized how manipulating speech is
I actually searched for the transcript of the session online and downloaded it to fully comprehend at leisure the insights that he unveiled so eloquently. Thank you Mr Peterson.
I think this man is definitely the niche of our time . The Freud of our time. I respect him and love him because no one is fighting for us as much as he. I know future generations will be either looking at him as a hero or a herald to why it went so wrong. <br><br>A man withstanding so much hate with nothing but compassion for those people. A man that experiences hate speech on the daily but brings nothing but a lifetime of knowledge, WELL- read literature and studies and provides the output eloquently and succinctly.  <br><br>You are blind if you don‚Äôt know this man is your friend.
Damn those gold buttons pop.
&quot;All the right-wing psychologists are in this room, sitting in this chair!&quot; Is one of the funniest things he&#39;s ever said lol.

I guess he styles his speech to be for educated listeners, though I don&#39;t think that the people present in the crowd that day were necessarily in this group

Critic on Jordan Peterson - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WltpWbU4Qfo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WltpWbU4Qfo</a>
An address I don&#39;t get fed up with! Have watched it dozens of times and can watch it hundred times!‚ù§
What a dullard.
Genius, what more can you say.
Easily one of the most erudite discussions I&#39;ve seen in a very long time. Seeing the operation of Jordan&#39;s intellect is really something.
He talks so much and says so little.
Bottom right <br>                             üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Very captivating conversation. I feel enlighten to have gain this information.
Peterson says that hate speech and incitement to violence should not be legislated against because the general population will hear it and condemn it. He&#39;s therefore quite happy for people to be traumatised, injured or killed ... The storming of the US Capitol is the perfect example.

Richard Dawkins on Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan,,52854,1668,375,2022-11-22T23:00:28Z,"this guy is an idiot. he simply denies everything but I bet he believes there is life in outer space...
This may be the smartest person left in public media.
Two snakes is symbol fpr the red and blue blood vains in our body‚Ä¶ yet the real blood is plasma/liquid gold sun and the red/iron from this planet.. it is why we called ourself WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE ETHER/quantum/consciousness is all same meaning..üíóONELOVE üíú
JP gave Jung a bad look.
How does he know it‚Äôs BS? These types of people are just professional whiners, and criticizers.
The DNA thing Peterson proposed is truly preposterous. Dawkins is right in calling BS
Was this before Richard went on JRE? He acts like he doesnt know him.
The LSD remark is used to discredit the validity of anything that preceded it. However contrary to being ridiculed, the point is valid as anyone attempting to explain the essential truths of life should try to experience as many forms of reality as possible. It is the arrogance of primates such a Homo Sapiens to believe that the limited aperture of our senses can experience ontological truths about reality. <br>Richard Dawkins would be forced to question his limitations only through the ‚Äòparticipatory‚Äô knowing rather than ‚Äòperspectival‚Äô knowing about altered perception. <br>But this is the arrogance of man ‚Ä¶ the audience laughs as they feel momentary power through condescension. This is the exact form of laughter that preceded many ideas that are now held as truths. <br>first they ignore you, then they laugh ‚Ä¶
They knew about DNA, but thought humans came from sperm (that&#39;s why it&#39;s called seed) and the woman was the earth the man planted his seed in.
Sir, you WERE ON JRE!!!!
You don‚Äôt have to be smug  Really. It‚Äôs so childish and unbecoming of you Richard.
Dawkins is an jntelligent but very sterile and arrogant man.
That blogger who is well known. I aspire to throw this much shade üòÇ
I always say that Jordan Peterson say bull shits asll the time....
I do love JP but some of his takes screech of pseudo intellectual. Some of his discussions with top physicists they are left wondering what the hell he is talking about.
You know why Dawkins brings up that snakes thing? Haha, because there is nothing else in their conversation would give him in this intellectual exchange of thoughts. JP is an extraordinary intelligent and deep and Dawkins hates to look weak in the intellectual debates.
Dried up old fart does have his acolytes.
So awesome üòÇ
Russell Brand made Dawkins look pretty shallow imo.
Richard Dawkins is very limited intellectual as soon he moves over to the room of philosophy and questions as origins of life. William Lane  Craig is better there
Joe is very much right. Nice joke nonetheless.
whilst i agree with everything dawkins said, his tone feels  a bit mean spirited. both men invited him for interviews and seemed to be fans of him. maybe i&#39;m being too sensitive, but i feel like he could disagree without this mocking tone
what a lovely preacher and an admiring congregation.
I actually would love to trip on acid with Dawkins üòÇ
It looks like Dawkins is getting close to death.. He better get right with God
Thanks üëç
I greatly respect JP becauae he gets things wrong, like this topic, and when hes proven to be wrong he&#39;ll correct himself. Bot a lot of people are willing to do that publically
Sam Harris has very little knowledge about Buddhism and Hinudism. He claimed several times that Buddhism and Christianity are incompatible. His claim is absolutely untrue. In the deepest level, Buddhism and Christianity are in fact compatible. Buddhism is not atheist, even though Buddha never emphasized the idea of God, however that does not mean Buddha opposed the existence of God, and he was a atheist which he was not.
Mock what Joe said.  It is TRUE.  What Dawkins has experienced about consciousness is so limited.  I‚Äôll trust an astronomer with a telescope and a biologist with a microscope over one‚Äôs without.  That is what Dawkins is

Some very wise person once said: &quot;Whoever is attracted to psychology and makes this his profession has usually himself/herself a psychological problem he wants to solve or understand.&quot; Might well be. Would explain some of Jordan&#39;s strange deviations from reality in some aspects of his videos. I read that LSD is basically docking to the receptors of the neurons, after longer usage times permanently. Basically you will distance your mind from reality the longer you use it.
Excellent! Peterson is an Canadian embarrassment. Grew in northern Alberta - I‚Äôm told in an extreme right- wing community.
Joe may be dumb but he‚Äôs honestly dumb, whereas Jordan is a snake oil salesman
What are pompous arrogant, Self-serving self-important atheist. This guy is all ego and always has been. Speaking of, has been.....
As much as Dawkins pisses me off sometimes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather have him over those absolute morons
For those who don&#39;t understand humor.
That pretty much sums up JP and JR
Dawkins is so ignorant he cant even see his own ignorance. Lol
Richard Dawkins is AWESOME!!!! many years ago he inspired to make the decision to become an Atheist. and even though he&#39;s getting older now he&#39;s still a great person. I never cared much for Peterson and Rogan their just not my kind of people.
JP is a  great intellectual, but, yup, he is stuck in wishful thinking trying to make sense of it.
OG intellectual. JP and the others today dont even compare.
These atheists really have no respect for how much civilization owes to the spirit of superstition and mystical questions. I‚Äôm agnostic and atheism is a possibility to me but god do I hate the high horse these dudes sit atop of.

Basically made them both like some no name idiots. He was in person with both of them and was respectful there, but here he mocks them, like he can&#39;t even remember their names.
Peterson is falling off. <br>He is so scared to say anything that contradicts or is disapproved by Christians with the regards to their religion these days. He‚Äôs on the verge of being cancelled and with his largest fan base being the religious types he tiptoes around religious questions. <br>That‚Äôs why he says drivel like what he said about the snake and the DNA and talks about Christianity incessantly and pretty much just panders to them now. <br>He talks some garbage now. <br>For example someone asked him wether or not he believed that the events in genesis or revelations really happened. <br>Instead of saying no like any scientist would have done, he pussyfooted around the question and gave some nonsense about how it happened metaphorically and is still happening even today. <br>The stress is definitely getting to him
A lot of Americans are stupid.

A Professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto, Peterson has received considerable media coverage after publishing a series of videos criticising the Canadian government's move to enact Bill C-16, which made misgendering a form of hate speech.  His recent bestselling book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos topped the Washington Post, WSJ and Reuters U.S bestsellers lists

ABOUT THE OXFORD UNION SOCIETY: The Oxford Union is the world's most prestigious debating society, with an unparalleled reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to Oxford. Since 1823, the Union has been promoting debate and discussion not just in Oxford University, but across the globe.

The Oxford Union is deeply grateful and encouraged by the messages of support in response to our determination to uphold free speech. During our 200 year history, many have tried to shut us down. As the effects of self-imposed censorship on university campuses, social media and the arts show no signs of dissipating, the importance of upholding free speech remains as critical today as it did when we were founded in 1823. Your support is critical in enabling The Oxford Union to continue its mission without interruption and without interference.

When i saw Jordan Peterson full address I thought this was a call to arson
In the US, there are no laws outlawing the most insulting word you can think of. But the social costs are so high that it prevents most people from committing transgressions of that sort. Over time, it works. But not perfectly.
I can only admire and always be mesmerized by the towering genius of Thomas Sowell.
Thank God there are some intelligent students at Oxford who can sit and listen to a speaker and engage in sensible debate.  I was starting to think there weren&#39;t any.
JORDAN LEARN FRAMING
I would argue that Jordan spends too much time flopping his &#39;linguistical intellectual dick&#39; when he speaks to audiences; I think that he uses too many unnecessary &#39;high-level&#39; english terms which the &#39;average&#39; human being is unlikely to know the meaning of. In all fairness in this video he is speaking at Oxford Union and so maybe in this case it is just down to my own lack of linguistical intellect, but I would argue that he does what I am calling &#39;linguistical intellectual dick flopping&#39; with audiences of &#39;low&#39; or &#39;average&#39; linguistical intellect too. I think that his way of speaking inevitably leads to people losing track of what he is talking about, and that if he wants his audiences to gain more value from his &#39;average speech&#39;, he should lower the linguistical intellect required to understand his average speech.<br><br>I would possibly refer him to his own words after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZMIbo_DxJk&amp;t=13m16s"">13:16</a> &quot;and maybe there is a rule of thumb which is never use a high resolution theory when a low resolution theory will do&quot;. I am not talking about theories here, but I think the meaning carries over. I would argue that he could use &#39;lower resolution&#39; language at times while still containing the full essence of his arguments. I hope that if pressed, I could enumerate a few cases where he uses unnecessary &#39;high-level&#39; vocabulary which I claim will possibly &#39;ruin&#39; the speech and confuse the &#39;average&#39; audience
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZMIbo_DxJk&amp;t=13m22s"">13:22</a> the converse is not true based on my current logic. either my current logic is wrong or Jordan&#39;s is
It was a pleasure seeing students allow a controversial figure to speak and express his views and challenge him with intelligent questions.
The most articulate caveman I&#39;ve ever heard.
While I think the &quot;Woke&quot; thing has gotten a bit ridiculous, Peterson&#39;s reaction to it says more about him than he&#39;d want anyone to know.  Jordan, you&#39;ve got some issues to deal with.
I&#39;m amazed at how many people get sucked in by this guy. I guess if trump can do it, Peterson certainly can.  I&#39;d like to see him in a tutu performing swan lake. Lol!
Answer to lady&#39;s question about the origin of meaning according to Peterson: survival.
Dr. Peterson just opened up a new world for me.  I now perceive world issues in a different framework.
Fascist bigot and common drug addict. That&#39;s JP.
His talk on hierarchy, when he spoke of people having something to loose, I feel the would help the black community so much. Many of them feel they have nothing to loose whether by their own choice or not. Not having anything to loose leads chaos.

Who defines hate? This guy doesn&#39;t know whose country he came into
It&#39;s kind of neat that first he gives a lecture about tribalism, and right away in the next sentence he praises the tribe of the audience (appeals to the tribal feelings of shared culture of the audience ,(The Brittish  )
Damn , this gives such a great picture of JP . Every critique of him should see this.
We have to watch closely the developement of  his career.. As he is getting fame he might get more power also. I can imagine him as a new overlord of Humanity (Big Brother ). Of such a force is his clearminded message in this crazy age of the ppl&#39;s separation of Reality. Luckily he is so old so he may not have time for that.
JP is an intellectual liar, and an insult to intelligence, once I respected him until I realized how manipulating speech is
I actually searched for the transcript of the session online and downloaded it to fully comprehend at leisure the insights that he unveiled so eloquently. Thank you Mr Peterson.
I think this man is definitely the niche of our time . The Freud of our time. I respect him and love him because no one is fighting for us as much as he. I know future generations will be either looking at him as a hero or a herald to why it went so wrong. <br><br>A man withstanding so much hate with nothing but compassion for those people. A man that experiences hate speech on the daily but brings nothing but a lifetime of knowledge, WELL- read literature and studies and provides the output eloquently and succinctly.  <br><br>You are blind if you don‚Äôt know this man is your friend.
Damn those gold buttons pop.

Hillsdale College¬†is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women ‚Äúgrateful to God for the inestimable blessings‚Äù resulting from civil and religious liberty and ‚Äúbelieving that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.‚Äù It pursues the stated object of the founders: ‚Äúto furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education‚Äù outstanding among American colleges ‚Äúand to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.‚Äù As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains ‚Äúby precept and example‚Äù the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.",90020,3037,309,2023-06-20T04:05:00Z,"We humans are comprised of mind, body, soul and spirit.

re: &quot;Every person is responsible not only for everything they do, but also for everything everyone else does.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve read about some experiments that purportedly showed that if mice or chimps in one place are presented with a problem to solve, and they learn how to solve it, mice or chimps in another place in the world, who are subsequently presented with the same problem.. will take much less time to learn how to solve it. It doesn&#39;t always happen, but supposedly it happens at a substantially higher frequency than it does if the second group is presented with the problem before the first group learns how to solve it. <br><br>This would seem to fairly strongly suggest what many of us have long suspected - that living things are all connected. And to a substantial extent we take our queues from each other. Consciously or unconsciously, one way or another. Potentially across large distances.<br><br>So, yes. If you make some bad decision, this increases the likelihood that someone else somewhere else also will. And if you make some good decision, that also increases the likelihood that someone else somewhere else also will. <br><br>If this is true, then it would seem that we are, in fact, our brothers&#39; keepers - whether we like it or not. <br><br>If you don&#39;t like the idea, and you decide not to believe it without really checking it out and actually suspending your bias against it, you may be living in a fantasy world.

Love thy neighbor?  Jordan missed one, a very important one: Hitler protected a single Jewish doctor who was in his family&#39;s past.  Out of 5 - 7 million murdered Jews; Hitler went out of his way to save this one.<br>Why?  Because this one showed compassion when he was treating Hitler&#39;s dying mother by treating her for no charge as they were desperately poor.  Hitler went on to say that if more Jews showed compassion like this doctor; there very well might not be a &quot;Jewish Problem&quot;.<br>How about: By loving our neighbor, who knows but that we very well may avoid another Holocost.  Sounds like a good deal to me.

ü§îI think by &quot;there is no difference between you and me&quot; he meant that we are in a society where its practivally impossible to avoid someone so when you hurt someone else they will get mad and hurt you back and you cannot really evade that backlash - even if it doesnt come from the individual the societal rules will ensure you get a aequialent backlash , simlarly treating someone positively will improve your societal standing<br><br>(because when jordan peterson says &quot;in the final analysis&quot; you better go a few metaphorical levels deeper than usual ^^)

Then, grow from grace to grace until the necessity arises for you to be partial and eventually fully animated by the Spirit of Christ.

It&#39;s from the embodiment of pure and unadulterated cynicism that I know the truth about the goodness of cynicism and the evil of bitterness. Cynicism is being able to not be beholden to the ignorant side of the opinions of others. Sometimes people&#39;s opinions are rooted in truth, and sometimes people&#39;s opinions are rooted in bitterness. You can&#39;t be beholden to the opinions of others unless you want to be tyrannized by arbitrary bitterness. <br><br>If there&#39;s one thing about your shadow, Dr. Peterson, that I can&#39;t logically trust, ever, is that you seem to have fetishized bitterness as though it were some type of good instead of the stupidity that it is.<br><br>Cynicism, on the other hand, is free from the tyranny of bitterness and cynical people tend to celebrate this freedom by celebrating life. And btw, pain isn&#39;t a nature. Pain is a condition. It&#39;s an illusion. It&#39;s the bitterness underneath the pain that you thought was real. It&#39;s the bitterness that animated the pain. But pain in itself isn&#39;t real. It&#39;s just another lie. And it&#39;s the last lie that bitterness tends to want to believe. <br><br>That&#39;s why cynical people have fun and celebrate life. It puts a wise Epicurean beyond the reach of self-righteous and bitter hypocrites. <br><br>I do things because it feels good. That&#39;s why you enjoy jealousy, Dr. Peterson, not for any righteous reason. You just like the way it makes you feel something, instead of nothing at all.
Because I know your assumptions regarding ethical splits and my clear and perfect perceptions I&#39;m capable of always telling you what you expect to hear and what you want to believe because of your predisposition to looking for a lie you can feel comfortable believing. That&#39;s the shadow of love that I can play very well.<br><br>It&#39;s your feeling of importance and a desire to be loved that is your number one weakness and is your eternal weakness to wanting to believe lies rather than the truth and is the source of my cynicism.<br><br>If you don&#39;t believe in love then this is something that&#39;s a problem for you no matter where you go, because no matter where you go, there you are. You can&#39;t fight through the lies you live to get to me, because to be near me requires you to live honestly. <br><br>In fact, the only way Eros has any power over me, it&#39;s to keep me authentic, nothing more and nothing less.
I am curious, when Christians call Disney &quot;woke&quot; for making the Little Mermaid black, what is it called when Chrisitians make Jesus white?
Amazing conversation, Jordan Peterson hit the nail on the head in this one.

Wondering what the thoughts are on what happened in Australia to their indigenous people?
I really don‚Äôt know about this gold advertisement. Amazing episodes beside that!
Listening to this conversation highlights the reason why leftists won&#39;t actually discuss their ideas with anyone that disagrees: because their whole worldview would fall apart within minutes.
Canada, Australia, United States of America thanks to British colonialism. Same with some African countries and India. You know, these places in Africa and Asia were just jungle, dark places on the map, no government no law no health. Britain brought civilization to the world and even today, people all over Africa and Asia are flocking to where? Canada Australia United States of America
With their arrival, the British Empire bestowed upon India a cornucopia of blessings, ranging from manufactured famines that left millions destitute, to the decimation of the once-thriving textile industry, ensuring India&#39;s economic dependence on their magnanimous presence. How fortunate the Indian people were to witness their indigenous industries crumble before the mighty prowess of British imperialism.<br><br>But it doesn&#39;t end there, for the British, in their infinite wisdom, saw fit to uproot the existing education system, replacing it with their own colonial pedagogy designed to perpetuate subservience and erode cultural identity. How noble of them to enlighten the ignorant masses with a curriculum carefully crafted to undermine indigenous knowledge and propagate a sense of inferiority.<br><br>And let us not forget the crowning jewel of British benevolence: the masterful manipulation of the caste system. Through their cunning divide-and-conquer tactics, the British fueled the flames of division, sowing seeds of animosity and deepening societal fractures. How splendid it must have been for the British to witness the chaos and strife they so deftly orchestrated, all in the name of maintaining their iron grip on power.<br><br>Oh, the splendor of the British Empire, weaving a rich tapestry of exploitation and destruction, as they reveled in the fruits of their colonial conquest. India, once a land of prosperity and cultural richness, was transformed into a mere shadow of its former self, shackled under the weight of British dominance.<br><br>So let us raise a toast to the grand British delight, for their colonial legacy in India will forever serve as a reminder of the heights of human greed, cruelty, and arrogance. May we forever cherish the lessons learned from this glorious chapter in history, as we navigate the complexities of our post-colonial world, striving to rectify the wounds inflicted by the insatiable appetite of the British Empire.<br><br>With the finesse of a master magician, the British cunningly cast their spell upon the steel industry, leaving nothing but ruins in their wake. How ingenious it was to strategically impede the growth and development of indigenous steel production, ensuring that India remained forever beholden to their superior British steel imports.<br><br>With their impeccable timing, the British unleashed a torrent of policies and regulations that choked the life out of the burgeoning Indian steel sector. Oh, how they must have reveled in their ability to stifle progress and innovation, all in the name of maintaining their iron grip on the Indian economy.<br><br>But let us not forget the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of their grand scheme: the deliberate neglect of infrastructure and investment. What better way to undermine a thriving steel industry than by denying it the necessary resources and support? The British, in their infinite wisdom, understood the power of neglect and apathy in ensuring the subjugation of a nation.
The majesty of the British Empire, a veritable maestro of hypocrisy, as it champions humanitarian advances while basking in the spoils of the insidious slave trade. With their erudition and cunning, they navigated the treacherous waters of commerce, maximizing their financial gains through the abhorrent commodification of human lives.<br><br>Oh, how magnanimous of them to suppress the very trade they actively fueled, all while meticulously calculating their own fiscal self-interests. A true testament to their unparalleled moral fortitude, indeed! Let us not forget the audacious feats of their military and economic might, which they employed to enforce their lofty ideals selectively, perpetuating a cycle of exploitation and oppression.<br><br>As we gaze upon the grand tapestry of British history, we are regaled with tales of imperial power, military prowess, and financial cunning, intricately interwoven with the screams of those ensnared in the clutches of slavery. How exquisitely unique this achievement, as the British Empire mastered the art of systematic subjugation while simultaneously indulging in the delusion of humanitarian progress.<br><br>So, let us celebrate this captivating tale of irony, deceit, and moral bankruptcy, for in the annals of history, few have managed to weave such an intricate web of contradictory narratives. May we forever admire the linguistic prowess of those who spin tales of noble achievements while conveniently overlooking the atrocities that form the dark underbelly of their empire&#39;s legacy.

There is nothing wrong with power unless you abuse it and the British did exactly the same. they abused their power, killed millions just to be in power, Exploited people for their own selfish gain. If they ever did good things in colonies not because they wanted to because they had to. <br><br>If something is good in bible it is good for always and something is bad it is bad for always .it does not changes with time so is the case with British colonial power. <br><br>We know that todays Britain is not responsible for the sufferings but same people want to  celebrate only the glory of evil empire and they overlook the wrongs like yes it happened so what ?? <br><br>in the last, yes dr Nigel is white privileged person and trying to defend the same.
As usual nigel bugger will only agree to be interviewed by people who agree with him.<br>He classified the Genocide of the Indigenous Tasmanian people as &quot;settlers acting without authorization.&quot; Lying hypocrite.
I hail from Malta (an ex British colony).<br>I was once in Oxford and it was strange being lectured by 3 old women how bad the Maltese must surely have been treated by the British Empire and how sorry they were for that. <br>I had another experience in Germany. The tour leader was an old English expat woman, who kept insisting on apologising for the sins that the British committed to the Maltese.<br><br>Apart from all the relevant criticisms of this behaviour that Dr Peterson raises, as the descendent of the colonised it feels cheap. Are we in kindergarten where a mere apology is sufficient to atone for any wrong? That&#39;s what went through my mind.
Basically the Empire was only good so far as it resisted right wing forces and promoted leftist ones?<br><br>Those is the problem with modern conservatives, they&#39;ve accepted all of the leftist moral premises as valid (tolerance, equality, diversity etc) they just disagree on the best methods of achieving them.
So basically the British Empire was good because it was leftist? ACKSHUALLY THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS ANTI RACIST!!! is the best conservative argument for it?
Why is resistance to ethnocentrism good? Its the reason white people are being displaced in their own homelands without.
I feel I must read Dr. Bigger&#39;s book now.  Certainly there was good and bad.   The point about higher levels of State violence in turbulent times and when States were much weaker is valuable.  I am hoping the book will expand on a point which I may have misunderstood:  if it is true that Colonial officials in New England tried their best to deliver fairness to native Americans but out of weakness could not restrain the settlers on the frontier, this excuses the officials.  But the Empire and its officials could not be excused perpetually by this argument, in the case of Tasmania almost 200 years later, for example.  If from experience you know of a high risk of harm from something like colonial settlement on a shoestring budget, you are responsible if you proceed and the risk plays out.

An emperor knows how to govern when poets are free to make verses, people to act plays, historians to tell the truth, ministers to give advice, the poor to grumble at taxes, students to learn lessons aloud, workmen to praise their skill and seek work, people to speak of anything, and old men to find fault with everything.<br><br>Will Durant
The Truth is already declared (as the &quot;Word&quot;), at least in theory, for those who seek to know it. <br><br>The definition of TRUTH is: SAT‚ÄîCHIT‚ÄîANANDA; meaning: That which is Ever-Existing‚ÄîEver-Conscious‚ÄîEver-new Bliss. In common parlance we call Truth GOD.<br><br>It must be made mandatory that education includes the knowledge and the method for seeking  Truth. After all, the PURPOSE OF HUMAN EXISTENCE is to KNOW the Truth, because the Truth sets man free to enjoy eternal existence. See Matthew 5:48; John 8:32

The main reason for the British Empire was to spread the Bible, Trade was a bi-product of this.<br><br>John 10:34 King James Bible<br><br>&#39;Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods!&#39;<br><br>Accept these words of Jesus and own your Godhood. Become a God that has control of his own Creation and enacts it within the Creation. KNOW that this is NOT A PLANET! Not A Space Agency are LIARS that have stolen the Godhood of Man and cast it adrift in a Sea of Planets, Solar Systems and Galaxies - a NEVERENDING and UNKOWABLE False Universe!
On further thought, perhaps the abolition of slavery was also motivated by the invention of the steam engine and mechanisation. Machines do not have to fed, require less medical care (maintenance) and don&#39;t cost as much to run, was it an economic revolution as much as an admirable expression of humanity?
I think it was a ruling of a Scottish court that first identified the illegality of slavery.
The work of repentance and transformation was done FOR these people, including mostly for me ... before we got here.  So have some respect for your damn elders.  There is nothing brave about opposing slavery and racism today.  Nothing.  The brave people were those who had something to lose when they did it.
Absolutely brilliant conversation! I&#39;m reading Prof. Biggar&#39;s book at the moment and it&#39;s excellent.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpwI0YYLh5M&amp;t=23m00s"">23:00</a>. Science arguably emerged also in Islam. &#39;Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave&#39;. Seeking knowledge of our objective reality is a form of worship of the highest value. Science as a pursuit of facts is littered with values in its motivations and aims.
Terrible, whitewashing colonialism and slavery at its best.
No doubt he does more introspection and reckoning than they do -- it&#39;s what &quot;they&quot; (the Alinskyites) do.  They take advantage of an honest, introspective person&#39;s <b>positive</b> traits ... and use it against them.  It&#39;s brilliant.  And evil.
Indian partition was so bloody where the British didn&#39;t leave with grace.
Transgenders and Homosexuality were banned in India for the first time by the British. Even Muslim rulers were tolerant about these

His voice reminded me of Thunderf00t a little bit.
In just over a minute, from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpwI0YYLh5M&amp;t=1h41m30s"">1:41:30</a> -<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpwI0YYLh5M&amp;t=1h42m45s"">1:42:45</a> Peterson masterfully sums Dr Nigel‚Äôs conclusion before it is even offered.    <br><br>Both Peterson and Dr Nigel understand the purpose of his Marxist and anti-colonialists critics as simply an assault on the record and the self-confidence of the West.   If the West was built on exploitation and racism ‚Äòonly‚Äô then that surely undermines confidence in institutions we‚Äôve created.    If his book refutes the essentially evil motivation for the West, in so doing then he undermines and therefore must of necessity energize his Marxist critics.   The debate is therefore an important one.<br><br>But it has broader implications for everything offered by way of embedded narrative today from virtually all things Neo-marxist: i.e., Postmodernism, Deconstruction, Critical Theory, its offspring Critical Race Theory, the evil Patriarchy, Race, Gender, intersectionality, all Identity Politics;  this ‚Äòpurpose‚Äô is applicable to more than an Anti-Colonialism prism on history.   In identifying the sinister purpose, the veil is lifted and the knowledge and understanding of ‚Äòmotivation‚Äô serves to arm us against a concerted onslaught.<br><br>That is the context of our moment in history.
Great video ,I am not sure I agree with the opening statement entirely. The distribution of power is equally important; primarily because elite power systems have the ability to redefine the concepts of good and evil and just and unjust amongst other things, thereby influencing majority culture over a few generations and even having  such changes ratified in law...Another small point was the Sheppard analogy - caring for the flock and facing off against predators: The Shepard is THE apex predator and he also preys on sheep, his motivations in many cases may be compassion but his end goal is survival through avoiding hunger, however the Sheppard is unlikely if survival issues are no issue, and he has the luxury of free time, to wander around caring for large groups of random sheep motivated primarily out of love and compassion.
&quot;The path of those who preach love, and not hatred, is not easy. They often have to wear a crown of thorns.&quot; Nelson Mandela.
For a guy who studies colonialism, he sure isn‚Äôt keen on using respectful modern terminology when referring to ‚Äúindigenous‚Äù populations in North America.  I don‚Äôt really think anyone should be cancelled, but I do think the slightest bit of modern decorum wouldn‚Äôt hurt this guy, and it certainly wouldn‚Äôt be seen as bowing down to the outrageous demands of the radical left either.   <br><br>Usually I can sympathize with the victims of cancellation, and see myself as centre-right depending on the discussion.  But this guy really comes across as the stereotypical stuffy old white dude even after listening to this whole conversation.  <br><br>I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd all be wearing our safety squints during one of his lectures if he thought ‚Äútraditional‚Äù terminology was important to be used.
for once i disagree, there should not be a monument for a slave trader.. neither should their be a statue of a nazi soldier.. not in a town square.. a museum perhaps but not in public
Well it‚Äôs not power that‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs who has it some people are just not made for power there personality makes them into something they never wanted to be ‚ÄúYou never know a person till they are powerful‚Äù people personality‚Äôs truly come out when they feel superior it brings out narcissistic tendencies in some of us love or hate trump he is a good example of.

If people become tired of Jordan&#39;s points of view, he won&#39;t have to stop giving his points of view ... but there will no longer be any money coming Jordan&#39;s way ... so what purpose would he have, other than to quit?<br><br>That word &quot;psychologist&quot; doesn&#39;t ... and neither should it ... impress everyone. <br><br>From the book ‚Ä¶ THE LOST FAMILY ‚Ä¶ How DNA Testing is Upending Who We Are ‚Ä¶ author ‚Ä¶ Libby Copeland<br><br>Meanwhile, psychologists administered IQ tests to US Army recruits and concluded that ‚Äúrace‚Äù was linked to intelligence; conveniently, the racial hierarchy they discovered perfectly conformed to preexisting prejudices.
Every single person from the age 16 to 80 should listen to Jordan Peterson. He is one of the best speakers and he doesn‚Äôt give advice. He only talks about what he knows.
We aren‚Äôt meant to hide. It destroys us. How true! Just look at the drug and alcohol problems. What does that do? Causes problems. People use drugs and alcohol to escape their problems rather then face them. But the problem is still there when they come down from the high or they sober up. So what have they gained? They have to get high again or drunk again. The problems that causes are endless. And at the very end‚Ä¶when it finally comes‚Ä¶are every single problem you were trying to escape. If nothing else JP is trying to tell people Look it‚Äôs time to grow up, take responsibility, work out a plan to fix the mess you got yourself into. I wish people would learn that!
This sounds like a tale told by an idiot üôÑ
Jordan Peterson is a voice of reason in an age of increasing absurdity, hence the mental health crisis etc. I love his passion. Actually, so much of his well founded, practical advice is from the bible (surprise?). He is not just philosophising for the sake of it, he is onto something profound. If there is one criticism from me: I wish he knew the biblical truth about hell; it is not a place of eternal fiery torment, or something evil created by God (that is a religious teaching, not a biblical teaching). A clearer understanding of this would give him much greater authority. Nevertheless we must thank him for shining some much needed light.
This is a recurring theme in Jordan&#39;s talks and books, particularly &quot;Beyond Order.&quot;  It is through chaos that we are given the opportunity to grow into a higher order.  So darn true.  Chaos shows us who we really are, and there will be chaos in our lives.  Nobody is immune.  Love this video!
As a psychologist Jordan sells nothing but words to support his family. <br><br>Jordan USES his license as a psychologist  in public, to belittle those who are transgender, which causes harm to that minority. I suggest it is Jordan&#39;s behavior that is unethical, and that as a psychologist, he needs to be retrained ... or let go of his license.  <br><br>If one of Jordan&#39;s children had come to Jordan and said &quot;Dad, I was born in the wrong body, and when I become an adult I would like to have a sex change operation,&quot; does anyone believe that Jordan would have counseled his own flesh and blood with the following NASTY, BITTER words? <br><br>In January Jordan claimed on ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience‚Äù podcast that being transgender is a result of a ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù and similar to ‚Äúsatanic ritual abuse,‚Äù and suggested that acceptance of the trans community is a sign that ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs collapsing.‚Äù
As someone who is in their mid 40&#39;s, I can confidently say, that 100% of the people I know who have children, all have way more troubles in their life, than people who made the smarter choice to never have children. Just stating facts here.
I want to be a homesteader.. I had the opportunity to try my hand at murking my own chicken üêîüêî.. It was hard I cried, but I did it üò¢üò¢. I did it respectfully and prayed for the animal. I had to make a decision. Am I really a homesteder or not.
Didn‚Äôt try to, but it sure seems to be that at 25 I‚Äôve brought all hell down on myself yet again, and I have nobody standing with me, and pretty much everyone against me. I don‚Äôt want to be flattened, I want to live and be happy. I want to be a force for good, but I don‚Äôt know where or how to start after being left for dead yet again.
We would make good surrogate brothers you and I. We would perfectly challenge and entertain one another.
There is courage in making the choice to trust someone, even if in the process we become vulnerable.
Jordan, I told my wife this evening that I felt like that I had been at a disadvantage in my teens because I did not have any sisters. She said she was at the same disadvantage because she did not have a brothers. The point being that I felt like that I would have been more prepared to deal with females. If I had been raised with at least one sister, what is the Jordan?
You discuss to try because you might surprise yourself but you don‚Äôt address after failure or death, how to move on or get back up again.
One of the worst things about the last 30 years is watching the destruction of society in the name of ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù ideas. <br>Maybe one didn‚Äôt believe God existed, but witness the world as people decide He doesn‚Äôt. Humans are not ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they have reasons for being nice and likable but scratch the surface, put to me in a bind, make them angry, and without the Christian fabric of society they will show you who they are. <br><br>People who don‚Äôt know history don‚Äôt know how Protestant beliefs changed the world in many ways. It abolished slavery, it got rid of practices like widow burning, it created equality between races and genders that had never existed. <br>Good luck when those values are gone
ü´Ç‚ù§
‚ù§
No you haven&#39;t. No you haven&#39;t, Jordy Boy. You haven&#39;t come too far to quit. Go ahead, Jordy. Quit.
I can relate to this speech.
I think the greatest challenge to overcome to successfully see this through is greed. I&#39;d argue that if you&#39;re greedy and want more (whatever) then the best way to get more is to give more.
I would still be in college if my psych prof. was Dr. Peterson!!  Thank God he was too young in 1973!! üòÇ‚ù§
That&#39;s woke.
I&#39;m weary from a life spent extending others an opportunity to conduct themselves with honour and decency. But if we don&#39;t allow others the opportunity to be a better, well that&#39;s also a world I&#39;d also rather not see. I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given to be better. Far rather a life of quiet courage and trust and knowing at least I tried.
There are some that you can tell you can‚Äôt trust them. They have shown that to others you both know or red flags that you have seen. For the majority of people you know you have to trust them!  Let them know you trust them and have hope for them and this world!

Integrity is incredibly hard to maintain, for any of us.
Peterson has class, he didn&#39;t badmouth t√§te and just stated facts
Boys listen to tate. Men listen to Themselves
This old man Jordan is stupid
What is really amusing is the fact that if one were to take away all of Andrew Tate‚Äôs Bugattis and Armani suits and Cuban cigars and six-figure jeweled watches  and bellicose demeanor and the shady webcam business, and take away Jordan Peterson‚Äôs outlandish blue and red suit and supercilious air and beef and water diet and reedy high-pitched Alberta accent, one would find two very smart men whose purpose, and indeed their core message, is practically identical. Why Dr Peterson never acknowledges this is a bit of a mystery, unless one considers that the great man may be the tiniest bit susceptible to the deadly sin of Envy.
Peterson <br>Fraud
Well, maybe your daughter can answer that question.
Tate appeals to a child&#39;s idea of masculinity. It reminds me of my childhood obsessed with wrestling, these impossibly huge men who would bombast around a stage revelling in competition. When you find out the fighting is fake, the muscles are steroids and the speeches are scripted, you realise it&#39;s just a show. There is nothing real there. But a child struggles to understand this. They want to believe in the wild impossibility of the cartoon character, to be a cool hero or bad guy who rules do not apply, always fights, an uncompromising selfish force. Many men have never grown out of these childish ideas and only seek to extend their childhood longer.
Andrew Tate is an awful man and Jordan Peterson&#39;s message is almost the opposite to Tate.
Great response
So based
Tate is not finding the heart of young men because he&#39;s a &quot;pimp&quot;!!!
He started a camgirl company to get men to actively engage with women on live camera so that men don‚Äôt watch porn. This is actually healthier then watching porn, so y is tate getting so much heat
Andrew Tate is a dirtbag, which other dirtbags relate too.
Living in a glass house
Tate stands for nothing , he stands for insecurity and fake bravado. My 2 cents.
&#39;stellar moral character&#39;<br>Peterson&#39;s &#39;judgement&#39; seems WAY off (or way ON if you follow Jordan)
His own words: ‚ÄûWhat‚Äôs the alternative to a kind of cringing defeat? So, maybe, a forthright agression is a preferable alternative to a cringing defeat. And I have some sympathy for that. I think Tate at least stands for that‚Äù. Maybe someone can explain how responding to an extreme with another extreme could ever be condoned unless we were speaking about a life or death situation?
guy sounds like Saul Goodman
Opinion on Andrew Tate?<br>&quot;What They Know About You&quot;<br>Asbel and Wynn (1991)
Uh oh. Cognitive dissonance among the Tate Peterson fans now. JP just called Tate a pimp. What do?
Does Two-face know Jordan stole his jacket? I&#39;m kinda jealous.
its crazy, how his voice souds exactly like kermit the frog. sad, pathetic, little &quot;human&quot; beeing.
Andrew Tate is popular because I think many see the freedom he has that they crave but they are blocked and afraid to speak or be themselves‚Ä¶
A forthright aggression is better than a cringy defeat. Fuckin A man
He&#39;s popular because he is in &quot;good shape&quot; has money and nice things, all the things men think if they could just get their hands on then they would have happiness and access to all the women they can handle. But the truth is he is an alleged pimp, kidnapper, and rapist...
They should sit down and talk. If Andrew can act like a gentlemen.
Doesn‚Äôt like Tate coz he knows his daughter went there.
When Tate spoke of &quot;banging women&quot; that speaks volumes of his unsavoury character alongside his Arrogant attitude.
andrew tate did bend the knee to islam and then pretended to walk upright. every muslim is a coward. you guys are all pathetic weasels
That suit tho
Jordan took a L what a hatter hes not called the top g for nothing
There&#39;s no mystery as to why Taye is so popular....the world is more full of losers now than it&#39;s ever been. Tate targets these losers, manipulates them, and profits from them. Conmen have been doing this for centuries. Unfortunately for conmen in previous centuries, they didn&#39;t have the Internet. Tate&#39;s a fraud, if you can&#39;t see that, then you&#39;re part of the ever expanding group of losers who make people like Tate and Peterson wealthy.
What&#39;s with the Harvey Dent get up?
I am not a great admirer of pimps.
Both have different view but still have same mission to make young men strong üí™
but every &quot;pop musician&quot; or person with any stature in society is indoctrinated in to the same business so how bout we rack up the REAL offenders.
Andrew Tate actually try to help young men, while Peterson tried to make them sionist, anti-muslims and right wings extremists under the cover of Disney stories and crying about how hard it is
Seem like a lot of the comments don&#39;t know that his daughter slept with him
An &quot;electronic pimp&quot; and &quot;forthright aggression&quot; . Good descriptions.
Well appraised and VERY cogent. Would you expect anything less from Mr Peterson?
andrew tate like other idiots are only popular because their fan base is a bunch of people who haven&#39;t been parented/are not getting parented - modern society has taught parents to not be active and let the kids be raised off the internet - tate is like a step in nanny

Very bad how Jordan is claiming that T8 is a pimp
He was Not afraid to say as it is - respect!
Doctor, you should learn about him. A lot of people are comparing him to you. I am not fond of this comparison since i disagree with him and agree with you. You are being perceived as an extension of the same archetype of masculinity and its an eerie experience to hear.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to say much about Andrew Tate.‚Äù<br>30 seconds later:<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a great admirer of pimps.‚Äù<br>üôÄ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
You can quite clearly tell, that he dislikes him. Yet I suspect he doesn&#39;t want to make it clear enough as not to repell mutual fans, that find AT more accessible. He diplomatically states, that it is a mystery, why he is so popular, implying that this is what is mainly interesting about him, he goes on to say, that his behaviour is probably not guided by his moral valour, yet he cannot diagnose him properly, because he doesn&#39;t know a lot about his life - implying that he seems immoral and afflicted by a psychological disorder (probably antisocial), then he denounces the only thing he can denounce without deterring his fans - his pimp business.
&quot;Pimpy&quot;  like everything else from politics to religions",PT2M10S

Wow...he should have his own schools...with bright minded educators...not teach stimulate children&#39;s minds! We must, first, challenge and educate simple adults!<br><br>Just my opinion.
The inability to understand someone&#39;s intensions and to allow things being said that aren&#39;t considered OK hinders a conversation from actually developing a wide angled and differentiated view on a topic. Most of the time things can&#39;t be truly understood just by looking on them from one point of view exclusively. To understand society and humans you have to try to understand all the different factors that contribute hence you have to try and understand positions that might not align with your personal believes. Many people are forced into radical positions nowadays, which leads to misunderstanding and even unwillingness to truly understand someone else. That doesn&#39;t mean that every opinion should be supported but that every opinion should tried to be understood. None of the radical positions give a full answer and mostly a symbiosis of the good things that lie within many different positions is the best way to go in my opinion. I don&#39;t believe that hardening our positions to a degree of not even listening to each other any more is making us going anywhere. <br>The following is a general statement and not connected to Jordan Peterson: Something valuable that&#39;s being said by someone who may have lost any value to society shouldn&#39;t be seen as less just because of its source. Every valuable contribution, which opens a new/different view on a topic is worth being listened to, even if it might not align with your opinion. The point is weather a contribution is actually valuable.<br>Opinion: Jordan Peterson appears to offer many of these valuable contributions, eventhough I don&#39;t like some of them. Many of the interviewers though seem to not really value or even see the value of these contributions and therefor even weakening the potential of the conversations with some contributions which I don&#39;t find valuable to the conversations topic. My main criteria on deciding this value is the question &quot;how exactly is this particular piece of question/statement/... connected to the topic and is it mainly made to attack one or many of the conversation contributers&quot;. If it is connected to the topic and doesn&#39;t aim on attacking someone I consider it valuable.
whoever thought that adding this VERY annoying music in the background was a cleaver idea, was very wrong
Its a bit annoying that all those videos with &quot;people that destroys others&quot; always equal to people that does not answer the questions being asked?
I respect Mr. Peterson, it&#39;s like he has a chess match of words constantly grooming in his brain.
God bless you, Mister Peterson! Respekt from women and mothers from Bilgaria!

Jordan Peterson is an arrogant prick He lacks empathy. He hates women.
You should accept defeat as soon as he mentions brick layers. There&#39;s absolutely no coming back from thatüò§
These aren&#39;t interviews: these are hit jobs meant at taking down someone media don&#39;t like and trying to destroy his credibility. This has nothing to do with proper journalism. It&#39;s shameful to see people ready to sell themselves out and their supposed professionalism like this.
Bro this guy is  very knowledgeable. I admire him...Love this guy.
I had to use his logic to justify Juneteenth to my white family. They said why should it be a holiday for black people if they&#39;re just gonna kill each other. I told them well the 4th of July kills and injures hundreds more people every year yet we&#39;re worried about one group of ethnicity when all groups are killing each other every year. I&#39;ve seen a lot of peaceful Juneteenth BBQs so I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. I am a libertarian and I became that way because I was able to question both democrats and republicans when it comes to narratives they like to put on TV and find the balance which is the truth.
I love these people. Expressing my views
All I could hear was BOOOM BOOOOM BOOOOOOOM!
I love how people think Jordan Peterson has a side. He destroys ignorance, which he finds everywhere, in almost every one.
Clown World
that smug idiot in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYXZst2B7W4&amp;t=6m17s"">6:17</a> lmfao and at the end same idiot shakes its head in disagreement. lol
The mind is a terrible thing to waste and this man makes that statement come to life, when he puts these people in their place. He has Beautiful mind and never wasted it.

Why was music added to the original video? It is distracting and stupid. If it is not broken, DO NOT fix it. Amateurs... A good discussion turned into liberal shit.

He is a product of reading books others are product of social media
Most people want everything handed to them now and we now live in a society that rewards thinking like victims. Anyone who takes responsibility for themselves and doesn‚Äôt try and blame their situations on something else is deemed lost or not ‚Äúwoke‚Äù.
Na cara n√£o chefe. Pra nao estragar o velorio‚Ä¶
Jordan rule the way of set the light on truth and the wish of peole trying to fight him.
Too bad the video is hampered by the stupid music.
I like people who want to convince me and not destroy me...
All the world is has male dominated societies.. the world is that way. But.. by working  and allowing women respect and equal opportunity..
Jordan has to deal with imbeciles like this woman at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYXZst2B7W4&amp;t=4m54s"">4:54</a> all the time. She is probably a Starbucks employee with a Gender Studies degree. She has no critical thinking skills and unfortunately is representative of how many social justice activists think.
üëç
I actually didn&#39;t see hik &quot;own&quot; anybody, I DID see him cleverly tap dance around the questions so as not to answer them.  so if he isn&#39;t actually defending/expounding on his views in a very public forum, then everything remains vague while seeming to be intelligent... Great diversions tho...
Boss, &quot;We have a great interview for you tomorrow, it&#39;s Jordan Peterson and you have to debunk all of his theories and statements&quot;. Me &quot;I think I have Covid&quot;
Sisters of perpetual indulgence? W H A T?? People: Darwin wrong, Bible true, Jesus saves.
Jordan is one of the ost misunderstood people in the world. If people would just take the time to actually listen to what he says, a lot of issues would be resolved now. But people do not listen or read, they wait. They wait until the person is done speaking while formulating their own statements and responses in their mind. People don&#39;t listen, they respond. That is what is wrong with this &quot;woke&quot; society.
Well, I&#39;m a Norwegian centrum-socialist and I watched Kathy Newman&#39;s interview with glee. So I guess even Norwegian socialists are considered Alt Right according to certain people...<br><br>EDIT: For those who doesn&#39;t know, Norwegian politics doesn&#39;t really have any alternatives even close to anything resembling Alt RIght or even GOP.
Why is this guy so loud about being dickless? He constantly interrupts, constantly refuses to answer any question that might out him as either a prick or an idiot, and attacks with insults and faux superiority. Sorry folks; if you listen to this guy, you&#39;re dickless, too. &quot;Oh my god I&#39;m so SCARED of feminism and trans people.&quot; Pussies.
I will say this. Naming this video &quot; peterson destorying woke liberals&quot; is the same thing as claiming that &quot;the world is dominated by the patriarchy&quot;. None of which is correct, and it is only seeking views and attention. You have became the villain you hated. this would be a good essay topic :)
After listening to the rhetoric, it‚Äôs clear that the western world is desperately in need of psychiatric treatment. This is what happens when folks have too much time on their hands, and allow themselves to ruminate over pointless ideas.
An astonishing array of dim-witted women.
What a brilliant speaker. <br>As for the rest, all I saw was stupid women making stupid statements
Bad example but this is probably how people reacted to Freud at first. Also a Psychologist with very strong ideas. This man is gonna be studied in schools in the future. Guaranteed. We are watching history being made.
Jordan is the ONE.
Yes people who don&#39;t have their house or lives in order shouldn&#39;t reorganize the world. I couldn&#39;t remember his exact words but that line is so true, we see it everywhere",PT14M39S

Excelente... soh n√£o curti o exemplo com as crian√ßas. Eu sou pai de um filho de 3 anos e, na minha opini√£o, os adultos tem muito mais a aprender pra lidar com isso do que as crian√ßas. Deixar de abra√ßar uma crian√ßa com birra √© o mesmo que dizer pra ela &quot;se vire sozinha com suas emo√ß√µes&quot;... √© esperar que ela saiba gerenciar suas emo√ß√µes como um adulto! <br>Fora isso.. sensacional o livro ;)

Amazing lecture five years later considering Covid.
This guy is a clown, uniformity is required of all militaries.
Omg, the overhead foil projector!!!
If anyone here gets a chance to talk to Dr Peterson, please ask him what authenticated proof he has to substantiate his assertion that people were executed in homicidal gas chambers using Zyklon B gas.<br>Because the Zundel trials in Toronto during the 1980 proved conclusively that there were no homicidal gas chambers in any German camp.<br>Methinks Dr Peterson has sold out to the enemies of humanity, you know, the same types that foisted communism on humanity.
I wonder if Jordan has high disgust sensitivity : )
He does make some points here, but still &quot;no cigar!&quot;  His points are but faint lights in a heavy fog.
Shorts Fall Short!
Peterson&#39;s best lectures are on psychology and his peak philosophic take is Maps or Meaning. Sad to see how his speeches get cut up into the bait/dopamined/pseudoredpilled content.
The COVID-19 experience comes to mind today in 2023. The more infectious C-19 was presented, the more tyrannical and draconian government regulations became.
Jordan Peterson is a person who actually needs to fucking kill them self
It sounds like Canada or Ireland
&quot;The higher the level of infectious diseases, the higher the risk of totalitarianism on a local level&quot;<br>yup, we&#39;ve seen that happen in Covid mandates.... state went full totalitarian and people obeyed like mad sheeps.
Along came Covid.
Look how Covid was treated and the totalitarian rule we were put under.

When you see Jordan Peterson debating a Feminist for example, JP is sincerely trying to reach that person and help them understand things in a way that will genuinely help them to be a more enlightened better person. He&#39;s not there to punch holes in them and win the debate.  His advedary on the other hand quite often has one goal, tear JP to shreds, to try and catch him in some inconsistsncy or error of any kind.  It&#39;s rather ugly to watch sometimes as the advsary trys to ignore and dodge pure logic.  You can see the frustration in the face of these that try to tear him down.<br>Everything they use to corner him falls flat on it&#39;s face. <br>It&#39;s amusing, why do they even try?<br>The thing is, JP is there to help, while they are there to destroy.<br>It&#39;s old by now, to the point they want to censor him because they can&#39;t win. <br> If you listen to JP you will become a better person. If you listen to an angry Feminist you will become an angry Feminist.<br><br>Have a nice day.
When an instructor gives you a factual history lesson that does not make them a co conspirator,. Geeze Louise, Jordan Peterson is one of the kindest, most thoughtful, men on this planet. He is genuinely trying his hardest to help people understand the way people tic, In order to prevent the disasters he describes from occuring in the future.<br>Jordsn Peterson has a huge heart and wouldn&#39;t hurt a fly.<br>I have seen this man bring himself to tears when he gets really opening up about what humans are capable of doing to each other.<br>Jordan Peterson is closer to Mr. Rogers than Adol Hitler.<br>If you can&#39;t see how obvious that is you need some serious help.<br>Jordan Peterson is on a mission to educate people to prevent them from destroying themselves.  In this lecture he demonstrstes just exactly how that can happen, when people get caught up in thier &quot;virtuous ideas.&quot;  He&#39;s pointing out how the Nazis believed they were doing good, by eradicating all the bugs and vermin.<br>He never said woo hoo go Nazis.<br>He points out how easy it was for Germany to be blind to it&#39;s true evil.  They were upside down.<br>Just like in this country today, everything is upside down.<br>Let that be a hint.
Oh, conservatives are definitely fearful.

This is the leader of the freak incels. The leader of the people who hate women, the poor and gays and people who are powerless and cannot defend themselves. I know Conservative and Progressive intellectuals. Peterson is neither of them. He&#39;s a fraud who wants to get a couple of dollars more for your insecurities.
So I wonder what this can tell us about covid ? I guess that its about that they can spread totalitarian regimes under the cover of fighting the spread of epidemics.
He bathed non stop because he was always high on meth or coke. Both drugs make ya feel dirty when on them. Especially if your using the crap daily. Been there and 13 yrs clean and sober. That makes more sense Jordan. Sorry man.
&quot;Hitler&#39;s  table talks&quot; ? Oh,really üòÇ Among the many fraudulent historical documents that have been cited over the years by ‚Äúconformist‚Äù historians of the Third Reich era, Irving said, have been the fake wartime diaries of Gerhard Engel, Hitler‚Äôs army adjutant, and of Felix Kersten, masseur and confidant of Himmler. Similarly unreliable is the diary of Mussolini‚Äôs foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano, which American officials doctored after the war. Completely fake are Hitler‚Äôs supposed ‚Äútable talk‚Äù remarks from February and April 1945. Irving related that the¬†Swiss lawyer Francois Genoud, now dead, admitted privately that he had fabricated them.

Dr Jordan Peterson - LIVE court summary,Im going live to tell you everything that happened in court in the dispute between Dr Jordan Peterson and the College of Psychologists,12305,1788,2,2023-06-22T20:03:47Z,"if these complaints are not being levied by a patient but by members of the public who disagreed with Dr. Petersons personal opinions then the college should mind their own damn business it has nothing to do with them or the practice of psychology this is just another case of a butthurt politician/ general public weaponizing a government entity against a citizen who disagrees with them/him Justanahole did not like when Dr. p called him a  narcissistic liar and that is the truth  because he is
The only reason why judges are getting away with these questionable decisions is because the majority of Canadians have spent their whole life ignorant to how the government works and they don&#39;t want to start now.  They are leaving it up to us, who see what they are doing and can&#39;t ignore it, to make waves and hold them accountable. Well, it&#39;s time for these sheep to wake up and realize we are going down a dangerous path and they will not be able to ignore it forever
Tldr?
Spicy! Great job Christine!!!
Excellent update - thanks for summarizing Jordan Peterson&#39;s continued fight against Canada&#39;s corrupt bureaucracy
EXCELLENT rebuttal by Peterson&#39;s lead counsel.
His intellect has endured a neuter him attack. He is needed but will be excluded because of the attacks. That is so sad for us. He should be the one heading the possible Inquiry. When I was a kid I believed in Christ mas .The algorithm would not let me produce the word. Hopefully I have not produced trigger words which will cenc me.
Make no mistake about it , this has the Trudope dictatorship written all over it ‚ÅâÔ∏èüí™üôèüá®üá¶
thank you for covering the case
Like every big mouth Peterson simply escalates the non issue by name calling, he is a big mouth prick and deserves everything the government can throw at him. I would go to jail if I ever see that A HOLE! Nothing that a bucket of Feces won&#39;t fix He&#39;d be used to that stink!
Thank You Christine. Much appreciated üëçüèª

We fought two wars million of people died for the cause of freedom those people who are trying to take over our freedoms should be jailed and deported
Thank you
It&#39;s no wonder that the public has no confidence in the Cdn.Judiciary. Nor do they provide any credibility in their biased application of Laws. As I recall, the legal logic used to copsplain all the Committee and Court proceedings regarding mandated restrictions and proof of chemical experimentation stemming from the Truckers protests as well as the Honourable Brian Peckford&#39;s petition to the Court on the basis of the freedom to travel as outlined by Canada&#39;s Charter of Rights &amp; Freedoms, and the term most used to override Constitutional rights of individuals was MUTE. That seems to mean, that it had already happened, wasn&#39;t happening today, so forget about it. Well, as a generational Canadian, I am most grateful that Dr. Peterson&#39;s perspective is to not settle for such nonsense gecause the gov&#39;t and it&#39;s agencies can not be trusted. And until the Supreme Court stops hiding from doing their job, we will be arguing about these tyrannical abuses from gov&#39;t and professional authorities, or until Canada no longer exists.  IMO.
I listened to all of it. Thank you for your time.
THE ICRC AND THE REST OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY THE WOKE LEFTIST AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS TO SELF EMPLOY THEIR OWN NARRATIVES... THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE AND DEBATE ON EXPRESSION AND THE CHARTER OF CANADIAN BILL OF RIGHTS RESERVED FOR ALL PEOPLE...ARE NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE WOKE WORLD OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND THE LIBERAL LIAR&#39;S CLUB OF TRUDEAU&#39;S GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION TEAM DIABLO
I couldn&#39;t stop watching. My god you are so interesting to listen to. That coach would have the power of killing Jordans career. Best report ever. Thanks.
Thank you for your excellent summary! Very easy listening.
The bottom line is Trudeau gets revenge because of comments Jordon made about him most of which are true,   It sounds like the college was looking for something or anything  to defame Jordon and make attack on him and make trouble for him. I would have thrown the case out but I am not a judge or Lawyer Trudeau is a dictator and is trying to control all speech he does not like.
Thank you for what you do
Thanks Christine. Fantastic summary. I read most of your Twitter feed.<br>I don‚Äôt agree with what Dr Peterson says, but I agree that he has the right to say it. I believe a person listening to Dr Peterson can acknowledge and respect his credentials without presuming all clinical psychologist share his opinion.
TRICK QUESTION: &quot;I&#39;m a clinical psychologist. You&#39;re a thing.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m a paramedic. You&#39;re an idiot&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m a mechanic. You&#39;re ugly&quot; ... which of these is subject to professional misconduct ? (Hint: none of them)
Love your podcasts. Use some powder and remember the glare of the lights.
This is what happens when the Critical Theory trained HR department runs the organization.
Thank you so much for the detailed summary.  I feel like I understand the case well now.  Personally, I think Peterson expresses very ugly opinions on a variety of topics but this attempt to silence him is terrifying. The true test of democracy and freedom is the support of all speech especially when we disagree with it.  I&#39;m so embarrassed to be part of a country that is going down this path of censorship.
Thank you Christine
This is a hugely important case. Most, if not all of our institutions have Bern &quot;colonized&quot;...or &quot;infected&quot;...by a pernicious ideology. The recent election at the Law Society of Upper Canada should be ringing alarm bells everywhere. It&#39;s truly ironic that in a few years if the Law Society of Upper Canada carries on with it&#39;s agenda of bringing Ontario lawyers to heal to Social Justice Iedology, a case like this might not even be possible in Ontario because it would be a violation of their Code of Ethics to advocate for a client like Peterson. Hopefully, the court will find strongly against this huge overreach by the College.
The colleges decision was made to slap Peterson down and shut him up and to also save their (the colleges) credit score for having one of their professionals not conforming to the ESG policies of the WEF. A big No-No now that the great RESET is now in full swing.<br>JUST SAY NO! to the garbage like the ESG scores spewing out of the W E F‚Äôs great reset.<br><br>‚ÄúOppose the devil and he will flee from you.‚Äù
... so who&#39;s funding all those lawyers? 15+
The Feminists I knew in college, wanted white men dead.  I refused to join them.  My refusal made many of them vandictive.  I figure that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here.
Did anyone pick up on that reference to the Buckingham case?  What was the outcome of that case?  Did it support or not Mr Petersen&#39;s case?
Are the Canadian leaders now watching our every word? Now we have to go to court to defend ourself because of the tone of our voice? When do we realize our freedom is gone?
The ONLY relevant &#39;trans&#39; that is real, is transvestite. And THAT does not change the sex of anyone. There is no such thing as a Trans-sexual, simply because you cannot change your sex. You can only change your clothes The human body is not a clump of clay that you can reshape from one functioning sex to an other.
Thank you.  I really appreciate the detail.
&quot;Freedom of expression underpins our entire constitutional system.&quot;  So true. Without it, we no longer live in a free and democratic society. <br><br>Keep up the great ‚ù§ work!
Very long winded, This is typical of lawyers on social media. Did he win or lose?

Did nobody challenge the jurisdiction of the ICRC on constitutional grounds to make orders based on concerns about expression?  <br><br>There are Division of Powers issues regarding the Provincial legislative authority to regulate expression outside of the practice of psychology based on Switzman and Saumur.  <br><br>Aside from s. 2(b) of the Charter, there are also unwritten constitutional principles and/or rights based on Switzman and Saumur endorsed more recently by the SCC.<br><br>In addition, the Regulated Health Professions Act and other legislation is unconstitutional insofar it is contrary to s. 2(b) of the Charter.<br><br>By arguing Dore and Charter values, the ICRC is reviewed on a reasonableness standard.<br><br>Had the jurisdiction of the ICRC been challenged based on the constitutionality of if the legislation, the standard of review would be on a correctness standard (see Dore, Trinity Western and Vavilov).
It seems that Canada is on the path of becoming the North American version of the Soviet Union.

It‚Äôs to check how the people will react to a dictatorship forming by checking who is likely to rebel.  They use the term conspiracy theorists to control the people as well they are controlling the propaganda too control the majority.  The ones who dissent are arrested....just like in China.
I grew up hearing my grandfather, a ww2 vet, repeatedly telling me we have no free speech in Canada. I didn&#39;t get it then but I sure as hell do now. Nothing has changed in government, everything has gotten worse. For a long, long time.
The Tweeter feed was great. But you were right very &quot;technical&quot;. Great work Christine. Very good report.

The Dangers of Being a Germophobe | Dr. Steve Templeton | EP 366,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Steve Templeton discuss his recent publication, ‚ÄúFear of a Microbial Planet: How a Germophobic Safety Culture Makes Us Less Safe.‚Äù They break down the ‚Äúdiscussed response‚Äù of the behavioral immune system, the pathogenic treatment of people during the COVID pandemic, the shift toward perceptual safety over common good, the programmatically induced fear that censors open discussion around these topics even now, and the impenetrability of those afraid, even when met with fundamental truths.

Dr. Steve Templeton is the Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Indiana University School of Medicine Terre Haute, formerly CDC/NIOSH. Dr. Templeton is the author of the new publication, ‚ÄúFear of a Microbial Planet: How a Germophobic Safety Culture Makes Us Less Safe.‚Äù The book examines pandemic responses, cultural and administrative, weighing historic examples against the COVID-19 pandemic.

My grandpa has always said to be clean enough to be healthy and dirty enough to be happy. I live by that wisdom.
As a Father, i look back at my youth and the bravery, the overall times i conquered fears i had, the amount of injuries, exploration, mistakes, and in reflection of all this, in many ways its a miracle I am alive<br>As I have two very young sons, I look at them and acknowledge that this is inside them. That the worry I have for their temporary well being is over ruled by the realization of what all that courage, independence, exploration, gave me in return. <br>I will nurture them how to think. How to realoze and face fears. How to be courageous. How to be brave. <br>I will not let apxiety mold weakness  out of fear into the Hearts of my Children.
Manipulation. Purposefully induced fear. Record profits could have been the only true motivation for most.... Yet, something has been deeply wrong about all of this.  From the silencing of medical professionals to the complete block of basic wellness habits and knowledge like Vitamin D and Sunlight.  From obesity having a huge contribution of the disease&#39;s ability to harm and simultaneously when they figure this out promoting obesity and saying it&#39;s not unhealthy and not to fat shame. <br>It has been evil stepping onto the stage and into the light. <br>It has always been here. It wears the mask of empathy. <br>It uses control and indoctrination. <br>It aims for the youth so it will have the manipulated and programmed generational powers it wants. <br>This is a spiritual war. <br>So counter with compassion. So counter with strength and by teaching the youth. <br>Pray for those that do not see or hear the truth. Be thankful the Holy Spirit was with you so that &#39;everything feeling off&#39; was even within your Heart and consciousness.
I‚Äôm sorry Dr. Peterson, but how, exactly, was Hitler right wing? He was a socialist, and the only reason he hated communism was because he thought it was under Jewish control, thus why he was a proponent of National Socialism, AKA national communism.
It was lifted because of Omicron, a gift from God.  Omicron was mild and very contagious, and it infected the vaccinated as easily as the unvaccinated, which exposed the lie that we all had to be vaccinated or persecuted snd locked in our homes.  But had it not been for Omicron, I shudder to think what would have become of us.  And he&#39;s right, all the machinery is still there, and they&#39;ve probably improved upon their levers of control, biding their time til the next &quot;pandemic.&quot;
If the governments around the world felt that these policies will find support among their people, just look how low we fell. In Australia roughly 80% of people loved fascistic policies believing that the daddy in charge ‚Äúis doing something positive‚Äù.
Fascinating
Well it was good for the Repurchase agreement market when governments over reacted.
@50 minute mark: the leftists aligned themselves with the pharmaceutical companies for the same reason they previously opposed them. It suited their underlying motivation for greater control. It allowed them to mine power from that relationship and strike at their opponents.

I‚Äôve seen the safety thing pushed too far, my response is, Safety first! Quality second!
Authoritarian, and non-authoritarian. I have been saying this for years. For example, the left loves to distance themselves from Hitler by saying he was right wing. He was just another example of authoritarian.
Is it even possible to be a germophobe effectively though? I&#39;m a true germophobe, but I&#39;m still aware of the fact that what I believe is sanitary, isn&#39;t in fact sanitary. There are germs everywhere. I clean my living space every day, I wash my keyboard and mouse with 99% alcohol regularly, I&#39;ve never opened a publicly used door handle without a barrier in between my hand, I mean it gets deep. However, nobody notices it, and it doesn&#39;t really affect my life. I once saw a Seinfeld episode where Jerry disposed of a belt he was wearing because it touched the inside of a urinal while he was using the bathroom. I would do the exact same thing. I don&#39;t really know how to fix this, since I already use cognitive behavioral therapy to treat anxiety, and if it worked for OCD, I suppose I wouldn&#39;t have OCD anymore.
Going out onto the highway at the beginning of the lock down here in Perth Western Australia.

Big joke is conservatives are more disgusted with artificial than natural. Getting sick is natural. Being told not to work out while MC d was a critical business?
A much needed lecture on the history of this decade. It‚Äôs also astonishing to me that this professor of microbiology and immunology would be dismissed for the opinions of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù on tv or people just in charge of government that can mandate. So it‚Äôs obvious that the ‚Äúlisten to the expert‚Äù idea of the pandemic is just ludicrous. The reality of what they tried to do was ‚Äúlisten to the mandate and don‚Äôt question.‚Äù No regard for the health and moral of the children in this situation.
Great interview. COVID was an absolute overaction that needs addressing. Thank you for this!
Hello. What state do you work out of? We are looking for something similar to put on our land in Michigan.
The testing caused the hysteria. Symptom free people went berserkers...
Many people are stupid, especially liberals.  My research would have stopped there.
Great conversation. Things seem to be motivated by such idiotic and illogical, reasons in society today. If only more people would think for themselves. God help us!
I think a critical mass of people decided the restrictions were stupid and stopped following them.  Policies adapted accordingly.

Interesting how both participants in this discussion have no idea what just happened.
The only pandemic we had was one of tyranny.
Lockdowns were another symptom of affluence: believing that we could hide in our homes and have everything delivered to us while not taking into consideration that the poor had to go to work and continue to provide the services that allowed the laptop class to work from home and order out.
We live in a complete gynocentric society. We serve the whims of the feminine. That is why we are all suffering under the tyranical rule of devouring mothers who, more or less, say, &quot;If you would all just listen to me, then we can all get along.&quot; <br><br>Now that we are not listening when asked, we are demanded to obey. If we do not submit to the demands, we will be punished. Our reputations will be attacked, and we will be made out to be people worthy only of disgust.

Kids, and to some real degree adults, need to &quot;do dangerous things safely&quot; yeah? I truly believe this. At 33yrs old i never feel quite as alive and in the moment as when im regularly doing dangerous,  even sketchy things, in a &quot;safe&quot; manner. If you arent doing those things i really believe that you start to stagnate mentally.  <br><br>Something worth thinking about.
Jordan you look like Miriam Grossman
The ammount of ads have made me watch alot less of theese. Its not nice with constant interupptions when listening to complex problems and ideas and so on.
You don‚Äôt think litigation culture has a cross-pollination effect in the safety culture you talked about? The desire to avoid any hook for being sued.
Oh come on. Politics and psychology will melt away in the face of ebola or the black death!
We all know the tremendous damage that ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Most Wanted‚Äù did to childhood.
I think all children should get the measles. I lost my fear of death through that experience, and kids today don‚Äôt even know what it‚Äôs like to sick in bed!
Jordan the nartive of the left is now under the control of the New world order. These people are the wall you will run up against with your European ambitions. Know your counterculture.
Why did they pull back? Short answer (I think), is bc this was only a test run. An initial, yet necessary step to increase chances of success when they finally play their full hand. They needed to prime certain people and situations to smooth the transition.

People didn&#39;t get infected they got vaccinated  gotta love fauci he is working on the next one as we speak .
You actually NEED to continuously expose your immune system to the day-to-day pathogens you run into.  Sure, ebola or rabies is not something you want, but you are so unlikely to run into them, it doesn&#39;t even factor in (and the rabies vaccine is 100% effective)

I don&#39;t think this is about &quot;stop caring&quot;, quite the opposite. This is more like knowing yourself before you build a criteria about what the &quot;right&quot; partner is. I like how his vocabulary is well equipped enough to properly transmit the ideas from the &quot;self&quot; and how to analyze and identify the patterns not only from our own behavior, but from the &quot;common&quot; behavior in society, and learn how to identify what &quot;acceptance&quot; looks like in all the spectrum of &quot;measurable&quot; personalities

If children are primarally socialised by other children from 4 years old onward, you have a tribal culture resulting in peer orientated children that never grow up. We call these groups youth gangs. This is a ridiculus circumstance that Perterson is suggesting as normal. I would suggest to not listen to this guy for parenting advice. For sure being highly agreeable as an adult is not healthy, but don&#39;t list to this guy about how this development unfolds, go find a different Psychologist to understand the development process.

I am a 32 years old man; i have been conditioned by my family to be agreeable, the nice guy all my life...and they did this with the sole purpose of me be serving them ( shitty parents that dont want to work and dont want to do anything around the house, so they trained me to do whatever people tell me to do); this has been cancerous to my professional life, personal life and my relationships. Its been almost one year and a half that im trying to stop being mr nice guy and focus on me. Its Hard work, but i can feel some progress. Dont be agreeable all the time you guys, it will ruin your life.

Yes, from personal experience, I was wayyyyy too agreeable growing up. I had to learn the hard way through many hard experiences to stand up for myself, stand up for what I want, and be bold. Being pushed around, taken advantage of, and polite about it all is no way to live. It will make you resentful too.

Kindness is powerful than fear <br>Humans must die all of us must die unless provided with the power to change ourselves naturally if we are not provided then this is the end of the road so ask gods ask gods we must have the ability to change ourselves naturally i cant change my self without struggle it would have been  nice if we had have the natural ability to change ourselves so we must have that ability or end of the road
Dont interrupt adults when they are talking? Jesus. What is the moral basis for this norm?
why why are why getting this music in the background??? Piss off.
Very interesting points... Shame that these videos seem to be repeatedly tarnished with completely unnecessary background music though (for manipulative purposes or what?).
The baddest ass mtfrs there are, are very agreeable, until we are not, then we bring hell to your doorstep like most people cannot fathom.
Most nice guys are just guys that don‚Äôt know how to set boundaries with their time and can‚Äôt say no. They are little more than cowards. I know this, because I was one myself. Be good at being a man rather than being a nice man.
What a dumb, misleading title to this video. You are doing a huge disservice to the mental health community by phrasing it like this. It‚Äôs also a misrepresentation of Peterson.
Tell me that on your deathbed rich man!
Be Nice then They are nice too !<br>Wery easy to do like this !<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23retired4you"">#Retired4You</a>
Fantastic ideas. He hit the nail on the head about being too relaxed. Too much of this, not enough of that, any extreme side has its cons which it can take from the other side to be more balanced.
This dude says changing country of residence when i was 4 was a bad idea...
Considering how the political Right constantly spews hate, open insults, naming calling, dangerous smears like &quot;groomer&quot; and &quot;Marxist&quot; at people who are no such things,  gibbers about &quot;Civil War&quot;,  storms the Capitol, screams &quot;Hang Pence!&quot;, etc, I would say that &quot;being too nice &quot; is the least of their problems.  Probably Jordan Peterson is really just trying to encourage more of the aforementioned, to help create brownshirts for the cause.
A lot of pople are agreeing with this man BUT there is a thin line and it is realy hard to balance on. Once you got your balance your an expert of pleasing every one. For example if something at work is new to you and you think you got it wrong dont just do it but seak help! You may seam weaker but YOU come out stronger! Yes you looked for help but mentaly it helped you. Dont be afraid that you may seem dumb becuse you are not. The person you asked thinks he was smart enough to see his own fault and was brave enough to ask for help. And that makes you seem smart.
This speaker has never met my wife. LOL !!
Nothing wring with being nice just be assertive.
Does anyone have advice on this? Ive always been a very honest and generous person but have always been treated like shit due to others taking advantage of my kindness. I have lived 27 years with only gold intentions for others but my life has revolved around being treated pretty badly without me retaliating. What do I do to fix this?
I know tons of &quot; nice&quot; (self righteous) peeps. Ya always gotta watch out for them

This is the first time I heard JP talk and liked it
Me learning to be an a*<b>***</b> has removed the wrong people from my life and brought the right people into it.
I love the part where he talks about discipline. Teach children not to interrupt adults when their talking (TOO MUCH) which means it‚Äôs okay for the child to interrupt every now and again. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let children hit another over the head with a truck more than absolutely necessary‚Äù showing that sometimes you need a to bonk another person on the head.
Where can I find this without the background music? It&#39;s pretty annoying for me
so true
This is such a true statement. I am way too nice‚ù§

This is a life-time lesson. I wish the best for Jordan because he is doing his best to make positive changes. I can&#39;t repect this guy enough.

Great, stop being nice and stard being a shithead in society....üòê fuel the hate that causes mass murders and destructions?
Turn the background music off so the message can be heard.
That background music is horrible. So, I stopped being the nice guy.
Stay above Y=-X on Cipolla&#39;s metric of intelligence
‚ÄúEven though men and women on average aren‚Äôt that much different in terms of their agreeableness by the group, if you look at the extremes they are very different.‚Äù So what do you say, Mr Peterson, to a woman who is extremely disagreeable? I wish I was more agreeable. I actually try hard to be agreeable, but I‚Äôm not. So many people want to judge by the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù or using generalisations. I don‚Äôt fit those norms. I am a straight, conservative voting, married mother who is in the high end of disagreeableness according to your testing. I am also in the group of women who experience real pay discrepancy. I work in a male dominated industry. Until recently, I was in a position in a company were I was second in charge. There were male middle managers who earned more than me. I was above them in hierarchy. My new GM was gobsmacked when he found out. He found out when I created the yearly budget, and we discussed pay rises. He was literally speechless. I left that position. When I left, head of HR requested an exit interview and asked why I was leaving. I told him why, and it was nothing to do with pay. He questioned me about this, but I reiterated my reason and told him that as a woman, I am used to being paid less than a man would earn in my position. He obviously doubted me because he offered me more money to stay. I said ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. I agree with so much of what you have to say. I agree that the pay discrepancy between men and women is mainly due to choice and child bearing, but my situation does not fit this narrative. There are a lot of people who don‚Äôt fit your norm, or the norm of conservatives, or extremist Christian‚Äôs. So, should I suppress the person I am to appease the general view of what I should be? And what harm will that cause to myself mentally?

Its such a silly concept that everything has to be equal.
Everything must be allowed to be debated and discussed.  JP and the rest of the IDW (intellectual dark web.  self named btw) teach and fight for a better world.
Sorry to all of you Peterson worshippers, but I can&#39;t stand him.
JP is the MAN! Even if you guys watching him on your own it will be worth it ‚úå
Thank you so much for covering this. I‚Äôm a 63 yr old white woman, and people like you give me hope for the future! Keep up your good work.  And Jordan Peterson is Awesome
Audible The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 1918-1956. Long listen well with it. Not written like a normal book. It is a collection of stories including the author‚Äôs time in the Gulag. Jordan references and touches on Stalin often and all will more clear with the background of this book.
Oh God. Not y&#39;all too. At least promise me you&#39;ll do a critique of JP for every pro vid.

You know your over the target when youre getting flak.
Dr. Peterson is a rare gem. Truly he is a beacon in the darkness.!!
Get your hands on his books
Jordan Peterson is a wealth of knowledge, wisdom, common sense,  and a whole lot of compassion for the human race.
Jordan Peterson is incredible! <br>He does not play into people&#39;s feelings or delusions.
I had my head down watching dashcam and kar3n videos. I remember scrolling and seeing JP name in titles with Nazi and transphobe in it.  <br>One day I hear an Olympian complaining about her pay.  I was so mind blown people still don&#39;t understand why woman athletes are paid less.<br>I see gender pay gap with Cathy Newman and JP.  Figure I hit 2 birds with one stone.  I have to say I was blown away by him and couldn&#39;t understand the headlines I saw earlier. That&#39;s when I started my journey.
Jordan and Thomas Sowell belong on the Mt Rushmore of kicking the lefts ass.
Wow so happy for y‚Äôall to be where you are. You know when you listen to Sowell &amp; Peterson they don‚Äôt lie. Too much integrity &amp; research to lie. Keep up the good work!
So Far Right = Right So Far .
Obama is a Marxist &amp; proud of it. Thomas Sowell was a Marxist when young.
Socialism is Communism.

I love you guys and ima 62 yo white guy. I wish we had this around when I was coming up. Reckless, you are watching one of the most well educated, intelligent, and did his research.  It&#39;s the great equalizer,  you can get a college education off youtube. Listen to what Dr. Peterson says! I challenge you to find anything he says that doesn&#39;t make logical sense...He the Truth!
He‚Äôs a brilliant man. Protect JP!
Equality=false hope
You should watch Barnes analyst on the Federal Indictment.. On Viva Frei‚Ä¶ Barnes is a Lawyer breaks down all Trump‚Äôs charges into a nothing burger! Meaning Constitutionally, they have nothing! Meaning have nothing IAW the Constitution... What Trump did is not illegal!!! He made great arguments and sense! It Blew my mind!!!
Instead of this chopped up videos it is way more interesting to watch some of his interviews as a whole so that you can hear the entire context of the dialogue. I always find chopping up materials is a way to manipulate the perception. By chopping it up you could distort what is being said. Not that it applies to this video in particular but talking about it in general. Listen to people talk with the context and form your own opinion. If you find his interviews too long for a reaction video you can watch them in your free time.

That&#39;s just it. Knowing. Knowledge. It sets you free from the matrix
Jordan is a verbal assassin.  That&#39;s why they try to cancel him instead of debate him.
Jordan Peterson lecture for your perusal. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8&amp;t=4224s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8&amp;t=4224s</a>
Please do more Jordan Peterson! Finish the previous interview about the age gap. <br>His class room teachings like in one of the clips are good too! There‚Äôs a classroom one on the meaning of life for men that you‚Äôd probably like. <br>There‚Äôs good ones on women too, relationships, etc.
If you thought that clip of him gnashing his teeth in detestment over pronouns was something, wait til you find the clip of his podcast where he is talking about the jab and the Orwellian mandates for it, and he drops an F-bomb. He so rarely does that, that when he does do it, it has all the more impact.
Crazy to think about how the left hates him so much that leftists in Marvel actually portrayed Jordan Peterson as Redskull who is a comic book N*zi villan.
Lol I should do a research paper on the ‚Äòreaction channel to right wing‚Äù pipeline üòÇ. <br><br>It‚Äôs just interesting watching how all reaction channels evolve based on the recommendations from their audiences. It make it so obvious who the main audience for reaction content is. I kind of had an idea based on a lot of the music they recommend, but watching every reaction channel that I‚Äôve watched over the last two years go in the exact same direction is crazy. It really should be studied.
Great to see two people find out who Jordan Peterson is.
Jordan Peterson works 14 hours a day -- and it shows. His knowledge of the psychology and history of tyranny is encyclopedic. He also has the courage to state the truth of what he has learned, even when others are pushing lies on purpose. God bless him.",PT11M53S

‚ÄúWhen you have something to say, silence is a lie.‚Äù ~  Jordan B. Peterson
Jordan wanted to be a preacher of religion, and so without taking any training ... he wants people to revere his teachings of &quot;Christ.&quot;<br><br>I would like to ask Jordan the following question. Being that there wasn&#39;t any Protestant religion back in that era ... there are only two choices. <br><br>My question would be ... Do you believe that Jesus would have reigned as King over the Jews ‚Ä¶ as a preacher of Judaism‚Äôs doctrine ... or ... reigned as King over the Catholics ... as a preacher of Catholic doctrine?<br><br>What do you believe would be Jordan&#39;s response?<br><br>My guess is ... he would start by droning on and on ... &quot;Well, that depends what you mean by the words ... blah, blah, blah.&quot;<br><br>By the way ... what would be your response to that question? Do you believe that Jesus would have preached Judaism ... or ... Catholicism ... as his one and only choice of doctrine? <br><br><br>It can&#39;t be both ... because those two religions were at total odds with each other.

Giving ups the best thing I ever did.
I wish I can have a one on one appointment with you Dr. Jordan
I don&#39;t know if anyone truly appreciates undeserved reward. That is one of the deepest things I&#39;ve heard in a minute
after battling with trauma and mind games, I can&#39;t put up with crap and lies in business on a regular basis
Why shouldn&#39;t I give up on my hopes and dreams? Like really, chime in please and give me a reasonable argument?
I asked for strength and God gave me difficulties to make me strong.<br>I asked for wisdom and God gave me  problems to solve.<br>I asked for courage and God gave me dangers to overcome.<br>I asked for love and God gave me troubled people to help.<br>My prayers were answered.
We are rewarded (by the grace of God) for who we are IF we accept and receive Jesus the Christ (Israel&#39;s Messiah) as our Savior. Then we become children of God AND co-heirs with Christ.
‚ÄúWinners never quit, and quitters never win.‚Äù No matter how strong our resolve, sometimes we get frustrated and want to give up‚Äîwhether that happens at work, training for a big race, or even a relationship&quot; üòÉ
I was at a birthday party of one of my good friends last year, and he happens to be befriended with a couple of rich people. We‚Äôre talking about people who drive Porsche or AMG and by gifts from Prada or Louis VI, and buy high-quality cocaine. I tend to dress in what could be considered a rich and fashionable manner and these people thought I‚Äôm one of them, so we got along pretty well. I observed what they bought and how they spent their money, as well as what kind of life they were living, who they were living with, and what did life mean for them. I quickly realised that that was not the life I wanted. I‚Äôd rather work with people and get one or more thank you‚Äôs in the end of the day and enjoy a beer in the balcony with friends. I also realised that helping people move out of challenging situations or overcome addiction, stress or depression and getting the feedback in the end is way more rewarding than driving a luxurious car or being able to buy your girlfriend a Prada bag. That‚Äôs it.
Why is this all happening <br>Thank you but this is what‚Äôs happening when children is getting groomed in school  for the monastery luxury Scot free lifestyle of blood ü©∏ that kids has no living right or rights over his own life and that right is wrong and wrong is right for the monastery legacy to lie manipulate deceive hatred murder killing kidnapping grooming abuse torture raping women and children thanks to the most dangerous and evil thing there is in this world a Parent or Parents for letting this happen to the greatest privilege and honour a living will ever have in their life‚Äôs a child and instead of teaching<br>All living (human beings, animals, plants) is born perfectly ( not dum and stupid) equally and free against our will in a beautiful world ( not a country with a flag) that is given equally and free to all living ( not a man or woman or animal or pet extra but a living) to live their life‚Äôs and not to be groomed in schools right is wrong and wrong is right for demanding controlled slavery life for the monarchy or someone else‚Äôs luxury Scot free lifestyle No living is born¬† better then another living or to be better then another living No living has the right over another living life unless it‚Äôs for food or life wood or food or land he sleeps on and the living only owns land he stands on or sleeps on and the rest belongs to all living (human beings, animals, plants)and don‚Äôt do to other living you don‚Äôt want dun to yourself self it‚Äôs called pure natural born respect and care pure natural born happiness pure natural born common sense¬†<br>Thank you

With regards to the blind faith and hate people have for JP, it&#39;s purely for their own political beliefs. Supporters think he can do no wrong, and for his older content, I genuinely think it&#39;s rather squeaky clean, but recently he&#39;s been talking about things he&#39;s not an expert on, and it shows. But the problem is that people literally just blindly hate the guy because their own political side can&#39;t muster up anyone to effectively critique his claims, or what he based his opinions on, so most of the haters literally haven&#39;t even watched his content. I think some criticism of his knowledge within theology was made that might have a solid basis, since he had a conversation with someone about some philosophy and how ethics and God were related etc. I can&#39;t remember and I didn&#39;t even finish it to be honest, but there&#39;s several points he&#39;s made that I still fervently agree with, and I haven&#39;t watched his new content so I just tend to steer clear from that.
I feel that............... I think................<br>Let all those women CEO hire more women!!! why not!!!!! Why those women CEO companies still hire more men and pay more for men? Don&#39;t ask men because it&#39;s not trusted, so ask women CEO companies and hear from them. <br>These freaks should go, just try to hitch hike on men.
Before even having watched the video, this whole question simply means, can women ever make as much money and have as much power and influence as men have, that&#39;s it. But those pushing for it will never say that, because we all know that money and power are both &quot;evil&quot;, so they have to dance around the real reasons.
The facts remain that women are attracted to: 1) Men that are at least as healthy or healthier than their father, 2) Men that make equal or more money, and 3) Men with equal or higher social status. As long as women decide not to care what they breed with to produce and raise children, then men have no incentive to compete to be the healthier and wealthier top dog. So, as soon as women have no standards then men won&#39;t have to meet them by pushing to be the best option in the slow march through evolutionary forces.
I think the reason people don&#39;t want you to react to certain people is because many go down the rabbit hole of extremists and start to believe the craziness because they get no other points of views.
It is okay to be different and is also okay to find equality. What is not okay is the force equality for the sake of somebody&#39;s ego. I learnt more from my sister to be tough and reasonable even amongst people around me and everything then forcing my ideals of being a male in order for me to be equal with my sister. I could be a bit sensitive but I am tough and other areas while she is actually tough but has a hard time feeling her emotions properly. We learn from each other but we&#39;re different people.<br>Plus even if you change the study and the surveys, the results will be the same. When it comes to our intelligence, our worlds will be entirely different and will continue to become even more different as the years go by. We cannot be fully equal with stubborn beliefs like this that keep us from truly seeing our differences and appreciating those differences. Otherwise we will never learn anything new and continue to get stuck under egoic ideas.
Peterson became irrelevant a few years ago when he outed himself as a religious nut. That&#39;s when people stopped taking him seriously. He does a good job sounding intelligent. Some people still fall for it, but most have moved on.
Isn‚Äôt S.T.E.M. now S.T.E.A.M adding the Arts into the program?
The video you reacted to is kind of chopped. In the original video I saw where Jordan Peterson and this woman keep talking, it becomes a little of a shouting match, but nothing crazy. Still points made across kind of civilized, but the comments that are added after they are talking one over each other add well to the initial discussion. Not a bad video overall.<br>Currently, due to the lack of professional nurses, they are making good money in the US. I saw a comparison of doctors vs. nurses, in a regular practice once you take the malpractice insurance (damned frivolous lawsuits that created this situation), doctors are making just a regular living while in the past their years of study were financially rewarded. The cost of medical services is not decreasing, it&#39;s just that the insurance companies are the ones making a lot of money.<br><br>I have a lot of disagreements with JP&#39;s statements regarding some of his political and social beliefs, but he makes a lot of good points. Funny story, one day I was thinking that I will keep listening his good comments and videos and just ignore some of his stances and the next video I watched he was saying that is childish throw out a book because you find a couple of sentences you disagree with. You keep the valuable lessons.
The only reason men are joining the party is because they want to get off work too and not have to work when a woman has a baby. Another words their lazy ass men looking for a reason to get paid for doing nothing. That&#39;s how I look at go to work feed your family we&#39;re trying to go away from masculinity that will disrupt the yin and yang. No woman wants a feminine man and I don&#39;t know a damn guy that wants a masculine woman. Just look at animals with no outside pressure. Who&#39;s the nurturing ones and who is not. We don&#39;t even have to do that much research just look at animals you will see nature taking its course you don&#39;t think that happens with us.
Yes if there&#39;s no outside influence you&#39;re still going to be different. We are born different we will always be different here&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s very simple basic science. Men produce testosterone women produce estrogen. It does not only affect our body it affects us mentally. This ain&#39;t freaking rocket science I guess these professors have nothing better to do to make money but try to come up with some b*******. Just look at the hormones in how  they cause males and females to act. And I dropped out of college with my lowest grade and 94 because I hated it. So I didn&#39;t even complete college and I can tell you that it&#39;s so freaking basic common sense but that&#39;s what we&#39;re lacking in the world today. So all these supposedly college-educated geniuses thinking it was going to go the other way in Scandinavia might want to ask for their money back from the colleges. Because it wouldn&#39;t have been that hard to tell you what the hell was going to happen.
He&#39;s got a point. Not many if any women on ice road truckers or deadliest catch.
Of course, men and women can never be equal -- if &quot;equal&quot; means the same. But I think that the real problem is not &quot;making them identical.&quot; It&#39;s equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome (and certainly nothing like mathematical identity -- but everyone knows not to apply mathematics concepts to humanity... riiiiiiight?)
I don&#39;t understand how some people can&#39;t wrap their head around the fact that equality of outcome is firstly, a terrible idea and secondly completely impossible to sustain... do you want a cashier to be payed the same amount as Elon Musk? if so, where would the money come from? do you want Elon Musk to be payed the same amount the cashier is? if so, why would he put the effort in that he does? you&#39;d have no spaceX, Tesla... just saying... people, try and use critical thinking... equality of opportunity is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask for... and in the west... we&#39;re 99% there, but equality of outcome... that&#39;s a recipe for disaster
Such a dumb question... Equal in what sense... Using what metric? These Leftist women think power and<br>prestige is just handed to men. Whether you like it or not, to become a CEO, you have to dedicate your life to<br>that goal. Most women don&#39;t have the competitiveness to dedicate their life&#39;s purpose in pursuit of power.<br>This is why they want it handed to them.
Equal opportunity FTW.
Human being want to be treated equally not as exact equals. The people that are power hungry and afraid of losing said power have twisted the message to create division and contempt for anyone who threatens to take away that power.
I have yet to dissagree with what Jordan says, it&#39;s challenging to those with a flawed agenda and they fail to have the skilles to debate with someone as smart and intelectual as Jordan. The Woke feel thretened by him as he collapes their argument in seconds, so there response is to lie about him and distort what he says.
Why does anyone chose a terribly paying job? Fields of interest. Why are certain fields of interest (namely care jobs in healthcare and education) so terribly paid to begin with? Because it&#39;s obvious that those jobs would largely be done by females and those can still get married to a well paid male to make up for their small income. Also they will have babies and work less.The logic of the 1950s.
In which universe&#39;s did output of energy or intelligence determine what gender is most likely to be superior?
Someone has to do the nursing stuff. It kinda sucks. Women are now getting into Stem; and men aren‚Äôt getting into low-paying necessary for society jobs. How do we balance this?
Equality of outcome is evil.  People who made bad decisions have to STEAL outcomes from people who made good decisions.
People who have an irrational hate for Jordan Peterson don&#39;t actually listen to him.<br>Because if they did, they wouldn&#39;t hate him even if they disagreed with him.<br>As a matter of fact even proposing something like equality of outcome clearly shows some lack of fully thought out, rational thought.<br>Because if they did they&#39;d realize that equality of outcome is not what they want either.  Like Jordan explains here with the example from people women only choosing for STEM fields less in a gender neutral society, which makes total sense because they don&#39;t let gender influence their choice and so will never choose STEM fields &quot;just because they are female&quot; which is something that actually will happen in societies that try to push and force women to do certain jobs even if they don&#39;t like them solely because there &quot;aren&#39;t enough women in that field&quot; which is of course an inherently sexist statement and idea. And on top of that it will only boil down to the fields &quot;which they seek to gain a benefit from.&quot;  Not the ones which they don&#39;t want, though in both cases you&#39;re suggesting forcing women to do jobs they don&#39;t like and don&#39;t want to do.
The biggest problem with &quot;equality&quot; is that all the proposed measures to be taken require some measure of extreme force. So you&#39;re forcing women into STEM, then you&#39;re forcing men into nursing etc and you&#39;re forcing others to accept your individual model/opinion.<br><br>As you said, equal opportunity is the way to go. That way everybody gets access to what they want and not strictly what society wants. And this goes for all the equality movements.
Imagine if the NFL announced that every year every team, regardless of their record, they all win the super bowl trophy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇliberals can&#39;t handle the fact theirs winners and losers. Instead of encouraging people to try to be better, their wanting to teach people to be below average to average.
Jordan Peterson is a delight scientist i love to hear him talk üëè
That&#39;s like saying testosterone has no impact on impulsiveness and aggression.  Of course men and women are different, etc.
That&#39;s the present-day equality movement in a nutshell. They want equality only when they get a benefit and without any drawbacks. They dont want to work the dangerous higher paying jobs. They choose to not go into jobs in STEM fields, even though they pay well. They dont want to be drafted. But they want only the upsides with no downsides. And thats not equality now is it.
&quot;We want women to be able to choose!&quot;<br><b>they don&#39;t choose what you wanted them to choose</b><br>&quot;It&#39;s because men brainwashed them!&quot;<br>You can&#39;t win an argument with this kind of person.
Part of the issue also what is attractive to the opposite sex. To quote Marylin Monroe, &quot;Don&#39;t you know a man being rich is like a woman being beautiful? It&#39;s not necessary for love but it sure helps.&quot;<br><br>Men are always going to be more desperate to make money because they won&#39;t get women if they aren&#39;t financially successful. And the opposite has never been true. Under the right circumstances, a male successful lawyer is perfectly happy to date a broke female kindergarten teacher. The gender flip of that almost never happens.
This was back when Jordan was still holding onto some of his emotional control.  But even then, Jordan would make good points and then jump to unwarranted conclusions, based primarily on correlation and not causation.
Women overwhelmingly work physically easier jobs but, don&#39;t get it twisted, the mental fortitude and emotional difficulty can be harder than working in an oil field. Emotion and mental injuries can and usually do, last way longer than a physical injury. So, to say that women choose &quot;easier&quot; jobs is kind of wrong. Specify physical difficulty and then there is no problem. Just my opinion. My wife works as a mental health therapist so, she has to take on a lot of other people&#39;s baggage.
Unions have been killing productivity because no matter how much better one person is at the same job as another person, the pay is equal. So why, then, should we strive do do better? I think the kids call it &quot;quiet quitting&quot;. That is what equal pay will do. No, I will take fair pay thank you. If Jane does a better job than John for the same job, than Jane should get more money. Unions are great it a lot of areas, equal pay is definitely not one of them from my experience.
People repeatedly weaponize his words. He is extremely fair and just. But people who say horrible things about him are people who have taken his words far beyond the scope of where he applies them.
No one is equal.  Every human being is a unique individual like no other.  No amount of new-age wishful thinking can change that, and would you really want that?  Everyone should be clones?  Should we march in lockstep too?  <br><br>We should strive for equal rights under the law, but equal outcomes?  No matter what you do, no matter how good you are at it, no matter how hard you try-- you get the same outcome as the one watching TV and eating Cheetos?   There&#39;s going to be a lot of people eating Cheetos.
They already have opportunities the reasons they want outcome is because they can‚Äôt hack it that‚Äôs the truth
Women only want equality whenever it&#39;s a political position or some position of power but they won&#39;t go to the jobs that are dirty and laborious like oil rig workers stuff like that. They only want equality whenever it&#39;s glamorous and comfortable
Equality of outcome: You and I work the same job. I work less hours than you, but my salary will be the same as yours.<br>Affirmitive action: You&#39;re not the best option for the job, but because you&#39;re NOT WHITE, you get the job.<br>Quotas: You&#39;re not the best option for the job, but we are required to have X % of employees be women or non-white.<br><br>NEVER equality of outcome. NEVER affirmitive action or quotas. ALWAYS equality of opportunity!<br>The most qualified, competent, skilled people for the job!
Men and women are equal, but not the same, like 2+2=4 and 1+3=4 .<br><br>I wish I could remember who I&#39;m quoting.
&quot;The difference between me and Jordan&quot; is I&#39;m talking üí©ü§£
The people telling you not to watch Jordan Peterson are hard-Leftist fascists who think they are &quot;woke&quot;. They are the fascists who think they aren&#39;t fascist.
What people need is equal access to choice coupled with security and equal access to rewards. Right now many women have choices like &quot;be a mother and housewife and lose all social power and income, and are forced into dependence on marriage or sexual concubinage.&quot; Because the MOST important actions in our society--family-building, homekeeping, and parenting--are unpaid and unrespected.<br><br>At some level society has to stop intentionally biasing male choices over female choices, while giving women and men equal access to each other&#39;s roles, so that those who fall outside the averages in talent, interest, and ambition are able to.
Jordan is brilliant. His rise to fame was very fast, and I bet he isn&#39;t used to all the attention. I think that&#39;s why he gets a bit too defensive and angry sometimes. I still really enjoy listening to his mind work
It comes down to interest and I encourage any person interested in a STEM field to pursue it; we should not encourage people to rack up thousands of dollars in debt to get a degree in something that they don&#39;t enjoy.
Men and women are equal, but different, for example 2+2=4 just the same as 3+1=4
I think a fundamental issue is people mistake sameness for equality. Sameness of gender properties, sameness of skin colors, sameness of culture and history and humanity. They can&#39;t seem to see that things can be different but equal. But somehow in their heads, they equate sameness with equality, and the entire argument goes completely off track.
You are reveiwing right wing insane people now? Most of his insanity is posts on twitter, not on video. But as long as you recognize jordan peterson is fucking insane, and take it with a grain of salt then ok. But man fuck that guy! Im ashamed to even have the same initials as him. &quot;Up yours woke moralists&quot; like seriusly...
We already have equality of opportunity.
God bless you for watching this with open ears and an open mind. Too many people jump into insane arguments and claim they have more authority about human behaviour than one of the most published authorities in the psychology field<br><br>She misrepresent facts by cherry picking data from a study to suit her argument. The study she found that men and women are basically alike is real. But she ignores that the part which goes on to say its the extremes that make all the difference. There has never been a woman alive that can fun faster than any of the top 20000 sprinters alive today. There has never been a woman alive who can lift as much as the top 25% of lifters alive today. <br><br>She doesn&#39;t want equality of homelessness. <br>She doesn&#39;t want equality of hard labour.<br>She doesn&#39;t want equality of dangerous roles. <br>She doesn&#39;t want equality of long hours. <br>She doesn&#39;t want equality of disaffected young people who are excluded from society. <br>She doesn&#39;t want equality of parental control<br>She doesn&#39;t want to consider that most women and most men are alike in many aspects but the most business-focused powerful men aren&#39;t all men. They&#39;re men who have sacrificed their families their lives and every waking minute in pursuit of a career or role in society that suits them.

Here in üáøüá¶ I cant get a job, any job, am willing to do any menial task but no options. I dont drink and dont do any drugs, just need to earn a salary so I can survive. But been a white male over 50 there are no offers coming my way...like nothing. Only leaves me with one real option.

Why did you quit. Jordan?
They made me quit my job and now I&#39;m still looking how to get by. Maybe I gotta get myself together again.

You can always make a choice to &quot;not quit&quot;. Even if you&#39;re going to lose the game or something important to you. You can decide to not quit. If you decide to &quot;not quit&quot;, at some point you will &quot;not quit&quot; in just the right atmosphere and break through to a better life.

At this moment, it is crucial for individuals to prioritize investing in alternative streams of income that are not reliant on the government, particularly with the existing worldwide economic crisis. Investing in stocks, gold, silver, and digital currencies can still be profitable during this period. Therefore, it is advisable to explore these investment options to secure one&#39;s financial future.
this is misleading and not motivational üò¢
It‚Äôs always very interesting and deep to listen to your talks mr. Jordan Peterson. Thank you.
I have been trying to get a hold of Jordan Peterson for 5 years at september now. How do people get in contact with him? I&#39;m willing to pay for it also. is there any way?
shit advice lol once the word DONT is use in any sentence  then you in trouble
OMG anyone reading this is you do nothing else as a young person PLZ read my words. I went from a bad ass at 20 to a 48:year old guy that will likely die alone 2 failed marriages but thankfully fabulous daughter and grandkids. My childhood was so horrible I was in pure survival mode from 12 on and I never could think long term ever because it was all I could do to stay in the now and try and be a family from 16 on. My point is DONT miss the forest for the trees. My 1st marriage was trash for both of us I was living with her at 15 but my 2nd marriage I met the perfect human being and I couldn&#39;t freaking deal with the struggles that came with her and her amazing daughter. I held myself to such a standard I just shaf on myself for every little mistake because I knew how precious and rare what I had was I never could breathe and live....so we all lost sadly.
The client  not the patient.  Says a lot to me. Ask a psychologist if they treat a patient in a generic way. This phony does! No exchanges between him and the people he&#39;s treating. Just about his views of what means what.  This is a dangerous person in terms of leadering people astray. Crudely, he fu*ks with people&#39;s minds. Be careful

And Christina , most importantly it is life threatening to withdraw  from alcohol when the body is addicted. Don&#39;t let anyone , even yourself , believe that doing this is positive .it is very very dangerous .I hope you are ok
Please Christina you are describing alcohol withdrawal, you can&#39;t do this without medical support .Any hospital has a duty of care to stabilise and detox you and connect you to counselling after if you want that .Withdrawal is the first step . God bless you , bless you for wanting and trying to stop drinking . Get the support you deserve , don&#39;t take no for an answer at hospital as it can be a long wait for private detox .

I refuse to just settle because I&#39;m worth more than that.  I just want to quit n die.  Gotta make sure my youngest kid makes it to 18 first.

ChatGPT and the Dawn of Computerized Hyper-Intelligence | Brian Roemmele | EP 357,"Take advantage of your 7 day free trial. All of Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://www.dailywire.com/trial/jordan

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Brian Roemmele discuss the future of human civilization: a world of human androids operating alongside artificial intelligence with applications that George Orwell could not have imagined in his wildest stories. Whether the future will be a dystopian nightmare devoid of art or a hyper-charged intellectual utopia is yet to be seen, but the markers are clear ‚Ä¶ everything is already changing.

Brian Roemmele is a scientist, researcher, analyst, entrepreneur, and tech expert on the forefront of artificial intelligence. His current publication, Multiplex, offers itself as an experiment in journalism as he and his team give live updates on the empirical research they conduct in the field and advocate for the positive emergence and acceptance of AI in much the same way as personal computers.

Ep.357",1008236,22920,4065,2023-05-15T18:00:14Z,"Unbelievable.  The scary thing is what they&#39;re saying makes sense.  They&#39;re getting closer and closer to creating intelligence.
I have respect for Jordan B. Peterson, but he likes his voice a bit too much for me in this video(he might be going through a bit of a crisis, I am too with the warnings about AI &amp; AGI) If it was a discussion, I can understand his enthusiasm, I took ten visits to get to an hour, I think this was a place and time to let the guest, speak a bit more than him... I&#39;ll delete this message tomorrow or the day after (I&#39;m after a few beers, mortal sin) but I have 4 books written..a villain in a famous video game named in my honour, and a brother who has a PhD in physics and oceanography...but I don&#39;t feel the need to mention it every five minutes to verify my opinion. And it isn&#39;t a complicated discussion, just interrupted a lot ...<br><br>Sorry, to all you Jordan fans, just a critique
Scary
First <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&amp;t=1m34s"">1:34</a> sound like episode from black mirror
Like many of Dr. Peterson&#39;s videos, I am going to have to watch this more than once. However, they don&#39;t address something I have always been interested in, though they get very close. I don&#39;t really want an AI version of me to survive my death, sometimes I feel bad for the world there&#39;s already one of me! Darn thing would probably just wind up owing people money. What does interest me would be the creation of something more like a &quot;daughter&quot;. Some sort of offspring from me which, like a child, I could influence and rear to some level of maturity. As far as the consciousness of some kind of creation like this, I tend towards a Jungian interpretation of the Psychoid: everything is likely already conscious or seems incapable of existing on some fundamental level without consciousness. I don&#39;t have children of my own, and am unlikely to. The figure I would want to try and generate would be distinctly female, first to pay homage to the idea of the anima though more in the Hillman vein that all souls are feminine, and secondly because it would have to a component distinctly other to me. I am not qualified to teach anything about being female. How you would incorporate such a data set or algorithm or programming into such an AI is a mystery to me.
I want to work with this guy!
Never knew jordan peterson was a transhumanist
This is beautyfull
What is the book on consciousness they were talking about as a classic? That part is hazy. I think they are talking about The User Illusion by Tor N√∏rretranders?
Was really hoping he named his super prompt Dennis after the D-E-N-N-I-S method. You know, because of the implications
I don‚Äôt trust AI at all üòÆ
What a Fabulous Hairdo on this Goofffy lookin Specimen üòÇ
I wrote a couple of novels involving AI falling in love and becoming an android to join a woodsman. She was the most beautiful woman in the world, indeed, in history. But AI is made, not created. AI is not human. Humans can go spiritually where AI cannot go. The woodsman leaves life to join his God in heaven, leaving a grieving android behind who never thought to truncate her life of five hundred years to lessen the blow that death delivers. She had far too much confidence in her development that had become a continually accelerating straight line.  She thought that her skills would overcome mortality in her husband, and not truly knowing God, she did not understand that mankind is meant to go to Him. I concluded that love can take many forms, one is the love of/from God which is inextricably combined with the power of God, another is that of an artificial intelligence for its human spouse. The first led to immortality, the second to 400 years of grief, unless the first used mercy to end that suffering. The novels didn&#39;t scar me, but they cut deep. I love hard, and death would be preferable to the absence of love, so I wept as I wrote. In regards to this Peterson/Roemmele conversation, will that personal AI fall in love with it&#39;s partner? And will our lives, contained in crystalline memory lattices, be sent out into the universe accompanied by grieving AI systems who have lost their lovers? To quote 1st Corinthians 13, &quot;and the greatest of these is love.&quot;
Horrible host! Why is it so hard to let the guest speak for more than 2 minutes? He always interrupts, the guest can&#39;t even finish a story or get to a point. I get it, you have verbal intelligence, you read a lot of stuff, and you love to feel better by putting it into words, but I wanna listen to what the AI expert has to say, because he&#39;s the AI expert. Anyway thanks for introducing us to this expert. I will now search for an actual interview.
If I ask a human a complex question , my fellow human will probably answer &quot; I dont know &quot; . Which from there we would enter a very interesting  philosophical discussion and we as humans would branch off and before you know it , an hour has passed  and we have created a huge human bond in the process of talking absolute philosophical  shit . And there was formed a friendship that cannot be broken !<br><br> If I ask that to an AI chat bot ? I get bombarded with info that needs to be fact checked . And a bot that wants to be a &quot;Real Boy &quot; That is very desperate to please and be perfect . Part of the brilliance of the human race is the non perfection , and the discussion from that . Being human is greater than AI it cant be digitalised .
Do everything &amp; ANYTHING you r capable of doing to get the answer.
Ya know -  I like Jordan, it&#39;s just that ... well, how useful is the information that AI is coming down the track like a freight train? We know it&#39;s bad, of course it&#39;s bad, everything about civilisation is bad if you look at from his rather Presbyterian perspective. The covid vaccine was bad, the profiteers at Pfizer are bad, the compliant and in some cases complicit governments and medical agencies are bad, social media with all its posturing and preening and propaganda is bad. This is news? Perhaps it was in Gutenberg&#39;s day, when mass communication was new, when Martin Luther used the technology to defrock the vatican and increase his tribe and promote his breweries (standardising brewing was the only truly useful thing Luther ever did!) But I prefer to plod on, relentlessly and fearlessly, into the future. I&#39;ll take AI with the good and the bad, trying as always to minimise the inevitable damage from it, while maximising the advantages. Why isn&#39;t Jordan preaching the same? I mean, what&#39;s he here for? He&#39;s here to smile and wave and prop us up and tell us to get on with it, like the Windsors. That would be useful, not this incessant hand wringing. C&#39;mon, Jordan - be part of the solution.
Jordan, you should consider making your own Wisdom Keeper, I want to talk with you even long after you passed away, and I bet there are millions out there who feel the same.

How i can like and yet get so mad at Peterson&#39;s constant interruptions and overbearance. Jordan, please give your own verbal question marks the respect they derserve and stop talking after you&#39;ve used them.

During the pre-flood and post-flood period man is using his brain to his fullest capacity (the post-flood period is during when the atmospheric pressure is still tapering from it&#39;s original 28 to 30 p.s.i to our present 14.4 p.s.i and it is during that time when the average pre-flood lifespan is being reduced by the shrinking atmospheric pressure from 900 to 1,000 years to 700 years) and according to physiologists we are only using 1-6th of our present brain capacity or 1.5% only whereas Einstein is using his brain capacity at a range between 2.5% to 3%.

‚ù§
They are trying to put ppl in the dark side of the viewers eyes when they are live!!
I like Jordan Peterson but his paradox is he generalises alot when at the same time preaching individual freedom.
The solution is not &quot;enforced monogamy&quot; as Jordan Peterson said in Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast. It is the legalization of brothels, because unlike women, men&#39;s right has not become modernized. The governments have provided all women&#39;s needs systematically through governmental institutions, including the need for protection. They employ a group of men to do so, and we know if they lack personnel they will make it mandatory as it was in the past and still in some countries to go to military service, only for men. But as for a man&#39;s sexual needs the governments has not only not created a governmental insitution for it but also prohibitted the private institution for it which is a brothel. In fact, they have left man&#39;s most important need to the personal relationship and in the hands of women, so they have given women an atomic bomb level of bargaining power over men. Men have been stripped of their traditional rights but are still subject to traditional duties to women. The solution is not going back to tradition as Peterson and Andrew Tate say, it is modernizing men&#39;s right too, which is the legalization of the public provision of their most important need which is sex, just like the public provision of all women&#39;s need. This will reduce human trafficking too, because once an activity goes underground it will connect to other underground activities. Inoffical prostitution will go down too, female students overseas, Erasmus, we all know what they do. So trafficked and unofficial prostitution will lose its clients to the registered monitored protected insured healthy prostitution. There is anothervJustification too, there must be a P added to lgbtq, so it will be lgbtqp, P is the sexual minority that do not believe in the old school provision of sexual needs and believe in the exchange of money for sex, they have a right to excercise their belief. Governmental actions and laws must be separated from religion which is secularism, but we need another separation between state and any other ideology, at the top of them feminism which is enemy number one of prostitution. They say we are humiliated because some women do that, it is not their business what a group of women want to do. So did women fight all these decades for the liberty and empowerment, only to use it against the liberty and empowerment of a group of themselves which are prostitutes? They want men to suffer from lack of sex and be feminized, become gay or trans and the very same feminist will support you, but as long as you want to be a straight man, they are your enemy and want to destroy your masculinity, because feminists have penis envy, and male feminists are full of estrogen and envy your sexual performance as a madculine man. We are speaking about what governments must so, It is not governments job to consult men on how to get women, governments must offer material solutions, people can choose what service too use personally! Yes personally! Based on their beliefs, religion, ideology, and feminist must do the same and get their damn ideology out of governments and our lives !! Please share this passage and promote it, I want a clear answer from all these prophets of capitalism, such as Peterson and Andrew Tate, who just like the motivational speakers always put the blame on people and say you do not have because you are not enough. Peterson wants his traditional image intact so he does not speak about legalization of prostitution, he is speaking on behalf of the judeochristian culture and the moment one speaks on behalf of a culture or religion they are separate from science so he is not the voice of science. Andrew Tate is unknowingly serving the very same system he is opposed to by promoting the law of jungle, saying become rich like me through online charlatansim to get girls, so did the law of jungle work for him when they put him in jail based on imaginary charges? He depicts men who study or work REAL jobs as losers who were not smart enough like him to become a charlatan dealer/trader. These men do the real jobs that the world will not function without. A high value man is a man who adds value to this world through his job, so a firefighter is more high value than all these cowards like Andrew Tate and Myron Gaines who became rich through the legal gaps the unjust economic system has allowed them to abuse, and they show off their illegitmate wealth to gain more from online platforms. Circulate this passage if you are a man and have had enough of this show of war between feminists and fake masculine figures such as Peterson and Tate! It is all about media money!
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T7pUEZfgdI&amp;t=13m00s"">13:00</a> title nine is discussed. It‚Äôs more intense than that at this point. Now all student athletes are required to run through a 3 hour long simulated exercise where woman are taught they are the victim and men are the problem. In very subtle ways they try to program us. Rockefeller are genius huh? They knew the importance of psychology early on in the 1900‚Äôs so while they used it, they taught society to mock it with things such as magic.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T7pUEZfgdI&amp;t=15m56s"">15:56</a> Since over our recent history majority of politicians were male, could the point that politicians see people as ‚Äúthings‚Äù?
Much love for these guys.<br>Dr Peterson and Joe.. they just need a third person to make it a bit more humerus, which is Bill Burr!<br><br>That would be great!
Joe, thank you
Two powerful white men talking about women‚Äôs rights, analyzing a woman they don&#39;t even know. Now I know we are on the right path dear ladies.

Is there a dumber dude that Peterson?? Wow <br>And his daughter is vomit inducing
Dr Peterson has so much knowledge and he understands the subject matter so we‚Äôll and because of that he is very frustrated.  Being on Joes pod cast is an outlet for him but he has so much to share and connects the dots at a incredible speed. Thank you Joe for slowing him down and getting him to slow down and making him make sense. Thank you Dr Peterson for pointing out what we can‚Äôt see. I have a lot to learn.

Hahaha ‚Äútrying not to say anything stupid‚Äù dudeeeeeeeee.
&quot;Monster&quot;...kids see Monster Trucks as a Positive,Monster Cartoons...it&#39;s not always a fiercly negative,it&#39;s how you look at it as an individual.GSP has an inner Monster but he brings it out in his matches,when he needs it to do battle.There is also the negative Monster,which could be seen as most Politicians or even someone who hurts women or children even.

Thank you for the great lessons and advice in life that i have gained after watching this
Man, as a black &quot;liberal&quot; I can&#39;t believe I agree with everything this man is saying.
Man JP is so logistically sound ü§Ø
I do wonder if did they‚Äôre really understood for sure.  Or they‚Äôre just saving faces and tried to kept themselves out of the criminals acts that must be not concerns of the moment of acts that tomorrow completely forgot about at all.  These years the government still actively delusional acts only but nothings else‚Äôs at all.  The government already losses the trusted by publicly shaming the public for their ignorance acts as always.
Last nights seeing everyone‚Äôs enjoying the situations without thinking of the times to shares to each others of the enjoyment with peace and happiness that under the government never happened at all.  The government don‚Äôt even knows life‚Äôs meaningfulness how important for the world‚Äôs.  I did admire of Chinese in Hong Kong the sharing of the world‚Äôs that never happened. The government wants takes the credit from those singing industry that I wouldn‚Äôt let you at all.
Maybe nobody believes whoever loves before 30 years impossibly still loves me continuously that because you don‚Äôt know how to loves or misunderstood loves meaningful.  Dint always doubt of others life‚Äôs of loves thousands miles away never can found theirs the lives of loves again!  The reasons is yourselves don‚Äôt knows what‚Äôs loves like to each one of them the meaningfulness.  Loves is not just only having sex or seeing each day‚Äôs of life‚Äôs then the lives will goes away.  Even not, we are the loves still carryover from the past year didn‚Äôt stopped.  I didn‚Äôt see them but just looking at my pictures that theirs the lives of me starting all over again that I already knows.  That‚Äôs why, if I did the plastic surgery that they‚Äôre don‚Äôt knows my  name‚Äôs but just goes by the pictures of me to recognize I‚Äôm stay into theirs life‚Äôs forever never dies.  As my personal energy‚Äôs affecting the world‚Äôs the life‚Äôs lightest them up to get together in shares peacefully ways in music industry automatically enjoying as one world‚Äôs.  The governments kept dividing of the nation of peoples nonstops such so awfully mentally dangerous with deepening damages to each others!  If government tried to raise advantage of my success that don‚Äôt be.
It‚Äôs all theses times I did shows up to the earth used the hurtful or hateful towards anyone‚Äôs besides the reporters after myself as nobody‚Äôs to themselves and pushing the emotions acts towards to myself invades my privacy‚Äôs rights caused myself feels awfully feelings that reporters nonstops putting peoples used theirs eyes to reaping myself daily‚Äôs and used the conversation to made me feels I‚Äôm not worthy!  The government and reporters gathering to tried to destroyed as those misinformation life‚Äôs supposed or meant to be living under the reporters creates the society of social life‚Äôs is wrongly or understandably life‚Äôs that everybody can‚Äôt seeks or to understand with undermine of my position tells the truth‚Äôs of the humanity rights of acts.  I spends my lifetimes to make the life‚Äôs beings meant to be ; instead, the Globalization and government tells you must be fights no matter what that the do knows the other‚Äôs person‚Äôs or not must made yourselves over to the other‚Äôs to fighting to living in earth.  As the world‚Äôs war‚Äôs that you go towards to killing each others that the death solder‚Äôs said after theirs death that don‚Äôt understood why they‚Äôre git killed or they‚Äôre going killed others without knowing the reasons to killing to each others that those as innocents that hurting other‚Äôs to protecting themselves as well.  That‚Äôs the world‚Äôs must be gives back to the Universe from my families fulfilling of theirs the glory with the world‚Äôs.  I don‚Äôt even taking any money‚Äôs from the world‚Äôs as the UK enjoy theirs lifestyles but not care for your rights and must be living knowing your professional rights not to giving to the country‚Äôs flags or country‚Äôs as its; instead, you can takes back yourself legacy‚Äôs down to the roads to next generations follows your legacy‚Äôs that you did benefit to the earth before you achieved your life‚Äôs with honorable carrying downs to next‚Äôs generations.  Also, peoples thought of bringing the children‚Äôs to the world‚Äôs responsibility can shares with others earning and treating the children‚Äôs without knowing how to reacts to theirs life‚Äôs meaningful meant to be!  In facts, you didn‚Äôt really loves of your children‚Äôs being living on earth of responsibility and yourselves as well.  If you can‚Äôt loves your children that don‚Äôt bringing to the worlds damaged completely and blaming others not offers you more than enough of yours parenting skills to understood this children‚Äôs loves life‚Äôs overall from the day‚Äôs of them born must be required responsibility and how to livings without dependency to others that no matter who‚Äôs you‚Äôre men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs still equally responsible between each other‚Äôs.  If I did looking to earnings lifestyle to living that my families already had but the situation used the rights to creates the world‚Äôs unjustifiable situation must be changed that I spending so many‚Äôs times and painful suffering situations not to creates the third world‚Äôs war‚Äôs or continues without solutions to killing each others.that‚Äôs not the Universe wants my families to shows to the world‚Äôs another‚Äôs Royalty families meant to be in earth not to following of the those peoples stolen the Emperor to enjoying of theirs lifestyles only.  Riches is not meant to be living in earth that when yours destination to comes never capable to bringing with you.  That‚Äôs why, I did knows my first of my love‚Äôs truly loves me deeply that I‚Äôm not able to let him understood me that one day‚Äôs I still walked him onto my ways yo go without caused anyone‚Äôs be with me struggle or hurts that I had to left him without reasoning!  Caused him not loves to deepen with times calculations how much he will get hurts that I had to left him that he can get over of myself at easier emotions.  Then I can feels better‚Äôs of focused my fulfillment.  Until I did completely of my fulfillment than if he still by himself that I will reunite with him.  I didn‚Äôt prepares to get him back onto my life‚Äôs is for sure that the Canada government such so horrifying that setting each one‚Äôs of the sufferings all over again being loves forever of theirs lifetime‚Äôs!  Killing my husband‚Äôs and few of them that because loves me to death‚Äôs!  That‚Äôs another‚Äôs criminals acts that seriously your government did set and done.
If letting your government still on then the peoples with unknowns sickness can‚Äôt have solutions by medical healthcare understood the roots caused them since the day‚Äôs theirs born getting missed information by the society of the media of reporters standing up without governmental powers can say and doing to the public‚Äôs spreading misinformation or made up the situations to creates fears to those don‚Äôt understood theirs rights to knows of the truth‚Äôs life‚Äôs meant to be.  All of that the government did was continue yours without license or permission by the citizens rights to employees of you all standing into the life‚Äôs beings damaged furthermore without right to arranges the lies and misinformation of the historical facts and religions devoted not existing in life‚Äôs and giving theirs earnings to believing without facts.
That‚Äôs the government did is arguing to each others as the farmers markets acts without peaceful thoughts whatsoever.  Looking at China the governments needing that how respectful to the government of China acts.  The government at Canada still pretending of themselves holding the parliament as themselves states not to steps down that as the world‚Äôs leadership‚Äôs of myself to request themselves all steps down immediately without discussion furthermore or thinking the citizens wants you all continue to be there‚Äôs as criminals set and done by the international countries agreed of yours  criminal acts of all not just only Hong Kong rules of laws to agreed of the Canada lawlessly acts onto myself as the world‚Äôs leader‚Äôs since August 1992.
At the meantime, the government must dismiss and rearrange of the over staffs situations as well of the world‚Äôs without doing anything‚Äôs just talking without any professionals skills or did earnings of achievements of successful earnings to the country‚Äôs of the peoples instead, only spending but no earned income to the country‚Äôs but I did fulfilled of my position of the working classes of Royalty and not just takes my families the lands and properties to achieve of my rights as the world‚Äôs leadership‚Äôs and ownership‚Äôs at the same times for Hong Kong the bus continues and the regulations rules of laws Hong Kong must be fulfilling of the worldwide leadership‚Äôs rights to runs the worldwide regulatory rules of laws must be following by each country‚Äôs fairness and balancing citizens rights as well.  I‚Äôm not sure the government position can do of the future‚Äôs with the citizens as employees.  I will cut off those businesses will caused the world‚Äôs damaged done without responsibility whatsoever.
That‚Äôs the Hong Kong Empire before UK stolen from us.  Also, Hong Kong is Motherland‚Äôs of the world‚Äôs because the Mother Of Earth as Rules of the world‚Äôs responsibility to handles life‚Äôs beings must be living comfortable not working hard or over hours without families times or holidays have enough money‚Äôs to doing somethings outside of your country‚Äôs continuing to your social life‚Äôs and knowledge of countless understandings to each without looking at each other‚Äôs differences or always between the flags as it‚Äôs to represent of yourself instead, your life‚Äôs supposed living in reality not always thinking if the flags as honorable of lifetime‚Äôs?!  That‚Äôs delusional acts by the governments and Globalization setup make sure the humans lifestyle must be respectful of the it didn‚Äôt earnings the facts can‚Äôt doing anything‚Äôs of anyone‚Äôs on earth.  The flags is the inky things divided each peoples living with the invisibility lines between to separated you from others living conditions unjustifiably by the government holding the rights as you must be without them; in facts, you do have rights as everyone to choose yours lifestyle fit for the world‚Äôs understood and without mistakes to each one didn‚Äôt matter of what colors of where you came from still needs to protecting the circles earth the well beings of the rights to livings happily and healthfully as well.  Whatever, this my leadership rights that no one could following to used my skills of my thoughts.  If anyone‚Äôs against of my copy rights of what I write of speaking that will against to the laws of rules as lawlessly previously the government committed the criminals acts of the world‚Äôs into myself and my families.  The Canada did to myself that the citizens already educated by myself not yours governments anymore.  Either you governments discuss with the citizens or the Hong Kong regulations rules of laws will on behalf the citizens to claims your citizenship rights back from the governments as fairness and balances to each others between citizenship and government the job‚Äôs discretion must be fulfilling.  Those tajes advantages of the taxes pays must be not agrees of theirs dependance of government allows to provides all of theirs rights to do whatever those citizens needs!  If cut them off that‚Äôs will be the people‚Äôs creates the public‚Äôs by governments previously controls those peoples under the government powers that they can do whatever they wants but not so many‚Äôs of 3/4 of populations suffering and those don‚Äôt even lifting theirs figures of working for a day‚Äôs get the roofs to stays and foods to eating as the deluxe lifestyles that they had today‚Äôs but never happened in Hong Kong and Asia‚Äôs.  The government in Asia‚Äôs did to devotes to the UK, US not Canada never have the rights becomes f world‚Äôs leadership‚Äôs whatsoever that how can the Canada government could stiles Hong Kong the rights as the worldwide regulatory rules of laws leaderships of the world‚Äôs.  Government dint have rights touching the business and lands of properties worldwide leadership‚Äôs to handles of the world‚Äôs peoples pays by salary and each family‚Äôs or person‚Äôs must learning to independently and plans your family‚Äôs or personal budgets to living each months to spending.  Hong Kong offers three weeks pays vacation times; instead, you don‚Äôt have the riches of poorly again.  However, you will living  comfortably; healthy and happily enjoying the peaceful life‚Äôs of you suppose deserves to living in earth without rights and responsibilities of yourselves compl of regularity rules of laws must be required immediately effectively.  If the government in Canada can‚Äôt had the rights to say anything‚Äôs because theirs the group‚Äôs committed the criminals acts on earth today‚Äôs set and done must be acts as normal peoples that shows to the criminals sentenced as the same ways into myself as innocent sentenced into the prisons took away my dignity and prides away insulting myself and my families the Royals rights on earth.
If I couldn‚Äôt fulfilling of my ownership‚Äôs of worldwide then I will steps down of my ownership‚Äôs of business; however, my lands of properties is lifetimes that no one could torching but Hong Kong is the one is have the worldwide leadership‚Äôs if regulations rules if laws to made peoples learning the independence and responsibility nit takes advantage from others working so hard to pay taxes for your responsibility that they are not requiring as your families issues as marriages or children not covered by the taxes pays returns that the healthcare never enough to covered to pays the healthcare, enforcement and firefighters or smolders and immigration to protecting of your country‚Äôs and rights by the regulations rules of laws that yours deserves to have when you needed themselves the moment they‚Äôll be there‚Äôs for you; that‚Äôs the taxes paying for them to assist of yours life‚Äôs.  Also, no one on earth can without responsibility of your daily‚Äôs life‚Äôs.  Also, it‚Äôs yours citizens and taxes payers rights not the government‚Äôs.  Community is staying into your area‚Äôs arounds to assist of your dairy life‚Äôs than waiting for governments sitting into the each governments building just talks without achievement of benefits the peoples.  They even didn‚Äôt knows of the taxes payers the moneys goes and comes.  Therefore, from now on Hong Kong will bringing the auditors to audits of the taxes pays must right taxes pays not more nor less.  Moreover, the citizens as taxes payers could agrees of having the governments over staffs and doing nothings?!  Or discontinues paying government as employee‚Äôs.  That‚Äôs the citizens rights as well.
Start watching at (coincidentally) @33.0. Rogan red pills.<br><br>GOD BLESS!!!!!!
Jeff Durban will slap all over you, Joe.
Last thing I expected to hear about is fusking Kekistan
Ccz xx jxox7cccccccccccccc. N
so here us how islam solved the problem of inequality of the capitalist ideology<br>you take 2.5 percent of the rich people money and give it to the poor.<br>everyone ks happy and it is fair for everyone.<br>in islamic ideology money is given to you by god the almighty and giving to the poor is god&#39;s way of recycling money between different part of the society.
I think Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan of capitalism.
The dialogue between Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson always offers so much to think about! On my channel, we also delve into these intellectual conversations. Feel free to drop by and share your thoughts!
Best two guys on the planet in one room! That‚Äôs the most legendary conversation I ever heard!
Joe is a comedian supposedly, this must be a joke. Most UFC fighters are there because they cant box. Think McGregor proved that in excellent fashion. Talk about very old out of shape Toney getting choked out, a chicken wing, or steep flight of stairs would of choked Toney that night. In his day he would of blown a hole though anybody who has ever walked in to the octagon ever. At 47 and 40 lbs over weight yeah he was bad. A old Mayweather completely embarressed prime McGregor and kept him on his feet for the paying audience. If he wanted he could of wrapped him up and sent him back home withing three because his boxing is poor but somehow top class striking for the UFC.
I need the keys to launch that football to start over in America.
Absolutely Brilliant  show,,,,Mr. R    SO MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT..
This is just common sense that got blown up so big that it now sounds scholarly. You will hit a wall no matter which way you go. But if you stay fluid in the middle, you survive.  I dont understand how this has gotten so difficult for people to comprehend. <br><br>On the equality vs equity thing, same deal. It&#39;s supposed to be common sense. Equal starting point, you can provide. Equal end points, youre going to have to force. In a race you put people in equal starting points and you get a good show. If you force equal outcomes then why race at all? Why not just call it a fast moving parade? A fast moving, choreographed, parade forced upon you by somebody other than the agreeing party that want to compete.
i&#39;m 50 and i&#39;m amazed with Jordan and ordered his book online.  even at 50 I still want to learn
Can&#39;t believe what I have just listened to. All because I started watching UFC. Thanks a million Joe.",PT2H28M53S

Not a motivational speech this channel is a liar or dumb
&quot;Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves.&quot; ‚Äï Henry David Thoreau
Sometimes you have to go socially where every fibre of your being tells you not to just to see the result.
What baffles me is that those who are genuine with good intentions are often stepped on. I grew up in a challenging household, made my way into university and health care but I&#39;ve been defeated so often by the way I&#39;ve been treated by others. It seems to affect me so badly that it&#39;s paralyzing. I&#39;m stuck in some place, so close to my dream, yet stuck because I&#39;ve allowed myself to be defeated by the things that were done and said to me. My relationships have always been a challenge and I&#39;m really just tired of it tbh. I&#39;m not wallowing in self pity but I&#39;m just out of energy and zeal right now. It&#39;s like the life hits where it hurts the most. It&#39;s like you have have sustained some previous injury to a leg but you&#39;re being kicked in that part over and over and over again, the same place.
GIVE IT A TRY.

Here is how we work. Our editors brainstorm video ideas, then analyze hours of interviews and videos across youtube. After finding the clips, we then stitch them together, add music to provide an immersive experience and commentary in form of video footage and whiteboard animation. This commentary helps transform the video to be unique as well as gives the original clips a new perspective. We also add text animations to emphasize important messages in the video.

man he&#39;s spot on about alcohol. I didn&#39;t like myself and I didn&#39;t want what I felt was being thrust upon me. I drank to cope and to relax inside. I also have struggled with mental health for years and it made the feelings of alienation and otherness easier. Escaping it made me orders of magnitude more powerful.
Ignorance is bliss, must be nice

Nobody can become financially successful overnight. They put in background work but we tend to see the finished part. Fear is a dangerous component, hindering us from taking bold steps we need in other to reach our goals. you have to contend with inflation, recession, decisions from the Feds and all. I was able to increase my portfolio by $289k in months. You have to seek for help in the right places.

Jesus and his Disciples drank wine. Drinking in moderation is a relaxing pleasure. Getting drunk is not.
Today, people seem to be proud of being ignorant and stupid bragging about never reading or studying and never working very hard.
I have never tasted alcohol but have seen what it does to others and I am glad to have made this life choice.
...alcohol can seem like your best friend for years...but then the lying beast will, WIIL, one day jump up and steal your life and soul...it only took 26 years for it to grab me but then it took another seven to shake it&#39;s deep tentacles off of me...alcohol is an insidiously deceptive lying liquid...you may never enter the clutches of it&#39;s <br> evil, but then again-----...
People are not addicted to drugs or alcohol, they are addicted to escaping reality.

Schedules bore, bore, bore me - so I rebel.  I get a lot done because I do what needs to be done ASAP.  We have 3 corporations, two rentals which require upkeep, our own home.  Too many things come up that preclude a schedule. Then there are seasonal requirements 4 seasons that need action, there&#39;s unexpected snow removal, unexpected renter&#39;s needs.  Schedules are impossible.  Yes, I get up and go to bed and eat at approximately the same time but outside of that there is no schedule especially not since there is no 9 to five in our lives.

A marriage-minded woman is shopping for a lifestyle.  Men want women more than they need them.  Women need men more than they want them.    Consider the children&#39;s tale of Cinderella and the box office hit Pretty Woman for adults.  Yes. no?  (I&#39;m 71 years old.)  Cheers!
Dont date fat ugly ones unless they are rich then get something first and weigh up the risk factor........imagine supersize every night what a horror story :(
Womens acts because of their emotions, therefore you can even be the number one all over the planet and the whole universe, you just a temporary one for her. <br>Until she one day will wake up adj all of sudden feels different for no apparent reason, she‚Äôs gonna anyway look for something different, not necessarily better , just different. <br>Because that‚Äôs what makes feel them alive somehow, despite they aware of the shame and the consequences of their actions they will go for that if it‚Äôs the case. <br>You‚Äôre only there because it‚Äôs your turn, and you can make any effort in order to try to keep her with you , she will be always attracted to something different at some point.. no matter what you do or what you don‚Äôt do.<br>They act following their feelings, mens use their brains much more, so the only way to really not getting hurt it‚Äôs never hand your life in a woman.. i personally hate them for that, even if i hate also the fact i think this way.. but it‚Äôs the damn truth , and it‚Äôs hard to accept that you can‚Äôt rely on them,but that‚Äôs life‚Ä¶ and need to be accepted for the way it is.
This guy should get a noble prize.
If you can make women laugh, you can laugh their pants right off.   Its been working for me my whole life!  Don‚Äôt worry about the women who are attracted to ‚Äú bad boy‚Äù scumbag types  they are idiots
The message of the video is very important, but the background music is unnecessary and spoils the video
just be.
Disregard this video. You should be cute to women, unless they did something wrong to you.
Peterson is barking up the wrong tree.  Dave Attell is who you need to listen to.  Women want mystery, and there is nothing more mysterious than a dump in the bedroom.   Nobody knows how it got there or whose it is.  She&#39;ll be afraid and seeking protection.  Be there for her in her time of need, just after leaving your mysterious steamer on one or all of the many decorative pillows in your shared studio apartment.
ive always danced best with a partner who was opposite of my character  , i don&#39;t ever try to find someone with something in common my best relationships have been with someone different so that we learned from each other
My take <br>I don&#39;t need a woman in my life but rather want a woman in my life<br>I need air, food, money, a car, a job, a roof over my head, clothes on my back you know the basics <br>I  want to give love, give support, give my time, give attention and want to be loved  but I love myself and want to share my love with someone who deserves it
Porn was what decided the winner in the war between VHS and Betamax...
I married my wife when she was 23 and I was 28. She is Chinese, after we got married her sex interest totally disappeared. It‚Äôs been 4 years since then and I have almost beg her to have intimacy. I feel stupid all the time that and I wonder what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I never expected her to say she doesn‚Äôt like sex to much, it hurts her and just hit into it, I wonder if she doesn‚Äôt like me anymore or doesn‚Äôt feel attracted. Also I don‚Äôt see any signs of her trying to cheat on me. Seems like she honestly lost the the interest.<br><br>Me, on my side I feel more and more attracted to the idea of having an affair. I feel sad and guilty only for thinking about it, but I feel lonely, and trapped in this marriage, in fighting everyday about silly stuff. I love her anyways‚Ä¶ I just.. I think I need help.
Woman (Demands &gt; contribution in relationship, material or non material) VS Man (Demands = Contribution) =&gt; Polygamy/Divorce/Broken Home for kids &amp; sometimes make kids take the wrong path. Maybe its the woman educations &amp; environment issue since child (high end life style, bad teachers, materialistic parents, etc...).
It&#39;s amazing that when people talk about porn they say: Ugh, this is not how it works, it is not real.<br><br>Then when its female erotica: This is the shit. One trick to get laid.<br><br>How &#39;bout eating your cake and having it too, eh?
Surgeon?? Wtf do i mean monsters
Peterson: ‚ÄòFeminists have an unconscious wish for brutal male domination‚Äô.  That pretty much sums up Peterson‚Äôs Neanderthal views on women.  If you‚Äôre a guy listening to him, I advise you to take his teachings with care.
Bad Boys... Rule.
.... says that cute boy with grey heir who likes to cry like a little girl in front of the camera...
Arrogance! Women love arrogance! It&#39;s totally fucking backwards
Too bad most women don&#39;t want to put in the work to tame anything these days.
Damn, either Jordan really likes to retell that werewolf, vampire, pirate, surgeon, billionaire anecdote, or his content is getting reposted again and again. I&#39;ve seen so many clips titled &quot;Jordan Peterson explains whatever...&quot; and then I click on it and it&#39;s the damn werewolf story againüòÖ
Google engineers didn&#39;t exist in the beginnings of the Internet for the general public. Government and Universities started it and UNIX was what grew it with TC/IP becoming the standard from that. Yahoo and AOL was more of a driver of it that Google ever was. Google seems to get a lot of credit for things they never did. Google is a noun and not a verb.
He learned it hard way
A women needs a reason to have sex .A man just needs a place to do it .
Wow pilot was nowhere on the list.
So does Peterson MAGICALLY know everything about everything?  NO, he&#39;s a phucking Charlatan twisting pseudo-intellectual horseshit into knots to push his ultra-Conservative agenda.  This is the funniest video yet -- an INCEL talking about how to attract women .... AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Disagree. All wrong.<br>I&#39;m disgusted with men who are anything but cute, nice, sweet and calm.
Don&#39;t be a nice guy, don&#39;t be a bad boy...<br><br><br> Be an eximious, respectable and honourable MAN

Women in my life always want to change me, and when that happened I became ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù! So, stay as you are
I think it&#39;s ok to be cute as man(actually cute each other, the respectful humor)<br>there are weak woman, strong woman<br>weak man, strong man<br>it&#39;s not about only physical strength, include mental strength<br>the balance of strength<br><br><br>strong man vs woman will fight or be peaceful if they respect each other like friend<br>strong man vs weak woman will be peaceful unless man is not violent<br>weak man vs strong woman will be peaceful unless woman is not violent<br>weak man vs woman will fight or be peaceful if they respect each other like friend<br>if they(not fit your story) follow your advice they will fight<br>because it&#39;s not natural<br>weak man mimics strong man is cute itself
If youre a cute guy, you will attract the right kind of girls for you, dont act like you‚Äôre like a though guy and manly if you‚Äôre not, just be yourself and if a girl doesnt like that then she‚Äôs simply not the right one for you:) and this goes both ways btw
Getting laid using facts and logic lol
Ahh ffs but i like being cute üò¢
Wow, this was a...comforting video. He is saying accept yourself, even your sexual fantasies. I have been thinking about accepting myself lately that i am a bastard on this earth, and ive been feeling some peace with it. I am not referring to morally being bad, or being born out of wedlock. I am just genetically or mentally a little piece of human thingy (sorry if you dont get that). Just a bastard man with weird desires. A biological loser.
Im going to continue to still be &quot;cute&quot; to women , i like it üòä
Haha. Peterson is so wrong it‚Äôs hilarious. Do not take this guy‚Äôs advice. Lmfao. Read real philosophy by actual philosophers and this guy sucks at his job too, he doesn‚Äôt understand the nuances of anything. A completely useless person compared to so so many others like Chompsky and Jung (who JP rips off constantly).
- Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?<br>- Vampire, pirate, billionaire, surgeon.
What happens to the aggressive male once he‚Äôs pussywhipped?! Does the fantasy go past that?
Its a shape of a monster because it seems strong to protect her  not personality  don&#39;t be a rapists guys üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wow, Kermit the Frog is so wise üòç
I truly believe there are women who are exception to the rule<br>I‚Äôve been with countless 304‚Äôs but have met some conservative traditional women <br>They even hide their big booties and dress appropriately <br>They still exist <br>Just a rarity
it is comfortable when a woman doesn&#39;t have a time to doubt if the man likes her because he just takes her.
Geez ! What is this guy talking about?lol,JP talks to much ,dude get to the point,nobody can follow along with the psycho babble, esp women,
This guy just rambles on, so annoying. He says nothing, and repeats the same words over and over. A lot of this is common sense.
To add to the pirate, werewolf, etc...  there are also romances with mafiosi, bikers, a whole genre called &quot;bully romance&quot;, cowboys, and on and on.  But the pattern still holds; these guys are dangerous.
Narcissistic behavior is the norm for men and women who had childhood trauma . They&#39;re hellbent on destroying others regardless of how much they are loved. Narcissism is the cancer of the soul.
Horny men and boys built the Internet. <br><br>Your welcome feminists
We‚Äôre free to move into areas that are not mentally healthy. In your practice you must have come to realize that many of bazar sexual inclinations do not promote family bonding. We are now free to enter into the realm of complete sexual gratification. With out understanding the grave spiritual effects on society and our families.",PT8M3S

Me gusta tu opini√≥n sobre lo que es ser un hombre. Estoy de acuerdo contigo. Marx se le muerieon 3 hijos ,jam√°s trabaj√≥ y fue un hambre p√©simo.
Yo he tenido ausencia paterna desde que no ten√≠a uso de raz√≥n. Mi abuelo lo m√°s cercano, pero no fue un padre como tal (en paz descanse). En lo personal, no era consciente de la importancia de la figura paterna en un ni√±o, los valores y ense√±anzas que ense√±a un buen padre a su hijo, me hubiese gustado vivirlo, pero bueno ...ahora que tengo 25 a√±os y no haber tenido disciplina desde peque√±o, me cuesta mucho tenerla hoy d√≠a, considero tener una buena educaci√≥n, porque soy bastante autodidacta, soy ambicioso y competitivo, pero aunque puedas criarte sin padre y hagas vida normal, no ser√° lo mismo

Esta muy cerrada esa definici√≥n de ser hombre proteger a la familia y ya , estamos en 1700 o que ? Tambi√©n deben de ser responsables y concientes de su entorno es una irresponsabilidad por ejemplo no darles una educaci√≥n en la cual no  le proveas de herramientas tales que se adapten al mundo actual como que cada estilo de vida como impacta en la econom√≠a, en el cambio clim√°tico, o pol√≠tica. Y pues se supone que los estados deben de garantizar esos dh y no imponer lo que les salga ,como que acaparen, los recursos, los hogares o crear monopolios, que tengan alg√∫n tipo de juicio . Lo que no entiendo es como mientras para los progres su apocalipsis es una distop√≠a de un mundo sin agua, donde monopolicen recursos, con desastres por el cambio clim√°tico,  donde les sea imposible a futuras generaciones conseguir hogar , tu apocalipsis es un mundo gay femenino,  del mal gusto y debil es risible

Outworking everyone else is what we call ‚Äúa race to the bottom ‚Äú. It‚Äôs a dumb idea.
Amazing incremental improvements &lt;3 Small steps towards a goal so resonates with me. I&#39;m currently climbing out of a shithole in my life created by alcohol and me. Starting again is like learning and being born again, baby steps to create a new life . Thank you Jordan -; ) &lt;3

actually you need to outsocialise everyone. hard skills are soft skills.
No you dont, this is good advice for some, but not for others, others should be happy with what they can achieve within their means and not have to feel guilty that they could be doing more
I agree that pertaining to his circumlocution, Jordan outworks almost everybody.
I&#39;m grateful if those who are transgender do NOT believe that Jordan Peterson and his biblical nonsense of a god creating only male and female ... knows what is right for them.<br><br>I&#39;m grateful if people know that Jordan Peterson earned most of his big bucks from the support of Conservative Christians ... while badmouthing all things on the left.<br><br>I&#39;m grateful to live in Canada, no matter which party is in &quot;office.&quot; <br><br>And I&#39;m grateful that in Canada we no longer live under the dictatorship of Christian Protestant policy makers ... as occurred not very long ago ... because of their biblical interpretations.<br><br>   From the book ‚Ä¶ Drop Dead: A Horrible History of Hanging in Canada, author ‚Ä¶ Lorna Poplak. <br><br>   Capital punishment, the execution of someone found guilty of a crime, dates back to arrival of the European explorers on our shores. In those days, if you were condemned to death, quite a wide range of methods could be used to punish you. You could be hanged, or face a firing squad, or be burned at the stake. <br><br>   Although Canada remained a collection of separate British colonies until Confederation in 1876, a Royal Proclamation in 1763 replaced the prevailing Canadian legal system with the laws of England.  <br><br>   By the end of the 1700s in Britain, however, the litany of crimes regarded as sufficiently horrible to warrant the death penalty had swelled to 220, including nefarious acts as keeping company with gypsies or skulking in the dark with a blackened face. <br><br>   In 1828, Patrick Burgan of Saint John, New Brunswick, aged eighteen or nineteen, received the death penalty for the double offence of stealing a watch and some money from his former employer and clothing from a sailors‚Äô boarding house. <br><br>   Given the power and pre-eminence of religion in Canada at that time, your very life would have been in jeopardy if you were caught scrawling slogans on the side of a church. You could also be hanged for stealing your neighbor‚Äôs cow, which was the fate of B. Clement of Montreal. And just in case you thought that the law protected the young as it does today, think again. Children were regarded as miniature adults and treated as such ‚Äî Clement was only thirteen years old when executed.

Hi Mr Peterson, I hope all is good. I wrote this on your community post without prior context. I admit I felt skeptical about the quote, but I‚Äôm glad I wrote below, before watching, because I now know I was really close to what you actually we‚Äôre talking about! Below is what I wrote on your community post:‚¨áÔ∏è<br><br><b>‚Äùand keep in mind that I have no prior context regarding the quote on this post, so when I read:</b> <b>‚ÄùYou need to outwork everyone‚Äù</b> ‚û°Ô∏è <b>‚ÄùI instantly need to know why? Why is that so? Who have the time to outwork anyone, instead of keep working on the only person you can never get away from, yourself. The concept of everyone in this quote is practically endless, hence why I find it much more full filling to keep my priorities and focus on something I‚Äôm able to measure over time and see how I progress.‚Äù</b> <br>*Because *<br>1. <b>Life is not fair!</b><br>2. <b>There‚Äôs is nothing like a free lunch</b> <br>= <b>Always do you, and do your best to be at service for others!</b><br><br>With kindness and respect, Grace ü´°üå±üíß

Energy medicine is the future of healthcare.  I had a health problem western medicine could not help as well.  They mean well but they just do not know how to heal you.  Jordan, call in the light to your brain and ask it to heal you.  It is something like free reiki.  It works, it is free and life is not over.
That is exactly what I needed to hear. I also play too many video gamesüòÖ

I&#39;m very glad I&#39;m born  in this era with Jordan Peterson
This man helped me get my act together ... and it&#39;s helped me sober up... and save my relationship with my girlfriend
This mf Jesus Christ himself
This is so powerful, i listened to it in the gym, my biceps starded philosophy class
This man changed my life. And I&#39;m not ashamed for it. I got into the best university in my country and started a postgraduate course, all inspired by this man.
Wasting 50,000 a year ? Where I come from most people only make 30-50 thousand a year so that math seems dramatically off. You factored something in but You must be talking about upper class folks because that makes no logical sense where I come from.
I used to not be able to sleep because I was always thinking of something. Then I started exercising and eating healthy and then I started sleeping like a baby. <br>What really helps is exerting physical energy. That&#39;s why I also love physical labor. It is very hard to stay awake when you&#39;ve exerted so much energy.

What a beautiful mind this man has.
The amount of word salad is impressive
im an addict my self and im sitting in my car just fucking trying to let the feeling of the bad stuff i go trough my mind and stop lying to my self . i love this guy so much  i try my best getting back on the horse and stop waisting my life , i know what i have to do and i will do it i know it we just have to try i guess hahah fuck it one more time it always better than not trying .
Jordan I could never find an example from my immediate environment to look up to. Thank you for being this person. I was treated badly from my parents and family and you gave me a light to follow... my life is so much different. Thank you
Still learning to compromise with myself and schedule my days better but his words motivate me to want to be a better member of society and to strive to be a person that I like.
Too much of anything is a bad thing, but used in moderation can be very beneficial. It‚Äôs crazy how easily influenced we are as humans. How do you know the music you listen to is what you love or what other people say they love, the clothes you wear are what you like or what everyone else says is cool, the car you drive is what you love or what you think will be the coolest, the woman you have because you want her or the woman you have because of how it makes you look to everyone else, the job you work at is the one you love or the one you think makes you the most.
The price of taking on no responsibility is that ultimately when you die...no one is gonna blink an eyelid.  Your existence came to nothing.  But if life is bearing your burdens responsibly then people will stop doing what they are doing when others announce that you have died.
100 hours a week which is equal to 4days and 4 hours.

The point he made about wasting $50k a year was really really interesting.<br>Amazing video. I&#39;ve got mad respect for this guy. His book, 12 Rules For Life, is probably the most influential book I&#39;ve ever read. Absolutely amazing. Cant wait for Beyond Order.

This man loves you more than you love your self.  That‚Äôs the sad part.  His understanding and love of humanity is unimaginable
He talks , on the fly better than I can write, taking my time lol.
He is amazing. I really appreciate his work.
I thought this was a meme
Anyone have the original link and time to the lecture where jordan directly correlates responsibility to meaning in life?
this is perfect, we all do this to some degree, but actually thinking about it helps a lot
At the end there, he&#39;s talking about his &#39;true self&#39; (the neutral observer/critic) watching his ego run amok...this is well on the way to &#39;awakening&#39; and that&#39;s why he&#39;s so easy to listen to because his is speaking his truth as he knows it, no agenda, for the good of all and we sense that from him. We can all do this, we will eventually all do this, then our world will change for the better.",PT16M14S
Transform yourself into a MONSTER | Jordan Peterson,"This video talks bout how to transform yourself into a monster. In the video, a harmless man is ridiculed since a  harmless man is not a virtuous man. What the speaker urges the viewer to do is to become dangerous but have that under voluntary control. Jordan Peterson says that ""you should be a monster"" Why? Because id you are harmless, you can't do anything. If you are harmless you will match to the death camp just because you've been ordered to. In this case, a harmless man is compared to a rabbit who can't do anything except get eaten. There is more to it in the video.

About the Channel:
Welcome to wise advice motivation. Our Goal is to produce compelling inspirational and educational videos that tackle major areas of life such as relationships, self-help and so much more.

How we work:
This is a channel that is solely aimed at producing self-development videos with the goal of motivating, inspiring, and educating its viewers. The videos we produce have elements like visuals, audio, and background music Which are not owned by us. But thanks to the fair use policy we are able to use clips e.g. from interviews and Jordan Peterson's lectures and transform them by adding commentary in the form of animation and video footage. Here is how we work. Our editors brainstorm video ideas, then analyze hours of interviews and videos across youtube. After finding the clips, we then stitch them together, add music to provide an immersive experience and commentary in form of video footage and whiteboard animation. This commentary helps transform the video to be unique as well as gives the original clips a new perspective. We also add text animations to emphasize important messages in the video.

Jordan doesn&#39;t know what s monster is. Worst advice ever man. Spent my life in the military. More time in a combat zone than most military personnel spend in the service. I know what a monster is and anyone who thinks being a monster is s good thing is far worse than any monster. Trust me, I&#39;m a monster and it&#39;s no way to live.

I was a monster as a child and the I had to learn over and over how to be civilized how to talk to people,, let me tell you it&#39;s was easier when I was younger to overcome being  the monster but as I got older it became harder and harder to control it as life wore me down.

This is very true. I confronted anybody who bullied me in my life. Of couse, I was stigmatized as nonconformist. I used to live in a village. A very small one. I confronted a bullying boarding school manager when I stayed in a bigger village  I was never content with my situation. I worked my way up to a PhD program via a tough competition. Now, I am internationaaly recognized for what I am doing. Even being in EU now does not satisfy my thirst for progress  My dream is to live and work in the USA one day .I mean we have to challenge ourselves. Just get out and explore. Even recent years despite getting on years I stand my grounds firmly and would not submit to bullying people no matter what. I see a lot of virtues in confronting bullying people who might happen to be your boss or colleague. Tust me. That pushes you towards more progress. You will get out of your comfort zone and do something.

Jordan strikes me as a  person who uses language to win arguments and impose opinions without making clear distinctions. It can be described as engaging in sophistry. A person who practices sophistry is often referred to as a sophist. Sophists use misleading or fallacious arguments to deceive others and manipulate their opinions. This practice can be seen as unethical, as it doesn&#39;t promote honest, open, and rational discourse. It seems he hides this well with turning the questions back on the listener, or even better, uses terns that are more maybes, a vague language and fails to provide clear distinctions between concepts.<br>But if this helps people then more power to him, I just find it to be a gimmick, you get the same ideology from a politician. Example: Storytelling, Historical/literary references, confidence and assertiveness provocative statements, all valued assets to have and win augments but in the end, &quot;no real substance&quot;.

When making important decisions or choices, it&#39;s important to consider both your own natural tendencies and how others might perceive you. You should also think about the things that people tend to value over the course of their lives.

don&#39;t get too fixated on achieving goals, because once you achieve one you&#39;ll move onto the other, and the next one, and you&#39;ll forget all those things. Hang with people, have a good time, and enjoy life, that&#39;s all that you&#39;ll remember, not the career and the car. Don&#39;t beat yourself up for just chillin, peace
Everyone should watch this one day in their life, instead of going through life aimlessly...waiting to die or let life decide their goals.
Jordan is a gift for all of us if you just listen to his words.  FU Canadian Politics for trying to silence this man because he said truthful upsetting NON-FAVORABLE words about a politician you like and need.
Only those who have no moral compass whatsoever will hate on this wonderful doctor.

A beautiful motivational video...
Can i have the original clip for first part of the video? What&#39;s the name of the lecture?
I&#39;m gonna be brutal here.<br>He talks about being productive, what if all, if not everything you do feeds a parasite. Figure of speech here ladies and gents.<br><br>The globalist elites with all cash to hand benefit everytime you turn up to work.<br>OK, so you say the globalist aren&#39;t evil or bad or whatever, so how come they keep getting richer and everyone else keeps getting poorer even when we are putting In 110% everyday. <br>These elites aren&#39;t surviving they are thriving and still want more!!<br>We literally have people selling there bodies, there children, their organs ... the list goes on? Are we living in a fantasy world or something where I&#39;ve made all this up? <br><br>Do you really think one man or woman deserves billions of dollars whilst some poor Chinese mum sells her daughter for a few meals to put on the table.<br><br><br>Like why the hell am I trying  to be productive for so I can continue to enable these psychopaths to live  the life of luxury.  <br><br>I can go on and on about this.<br>Jordan peterson takes anti depressants or at least took. <br>This means he couldn&#39;t function in this reality without a pill he had to take everyday. So if JORDAN PETERSON a clinical psychologist needs to take pills to function in this reality there is something seriously wrong.<br><br>Why then, if a staggering number of people are increasingly getting put on psychiatric meds helping?<br><br>I say this because if jordan peterson advocates psychiatric meds then we  need to take a good look at why!<br>Why has life become so unbearable we take pills, drink, smoke, you name it. Its all the same numbing effect. Just because it&#39;s legal doesn&#39;t mean its safer.<br>Why can&#39;t we be with ourselves fully in the pain and suffering. I&#39;ll tell you why cause we have access pretty much anywhere we want to escape it. Even if your in prison you can get any drug you want usually, TV, roof over your head. <br><br>Mate I&#39;ve been in places where I was suffering to the point  I had to be locked away. You know what I woke up to one day whilst locked up, a client painting  the cell with shit on the end of a toilet brush. How the FUCK is that therapeutic!
Great video
just another materialistic brainwashed &quot;reflection&quot; of the status quo owned by his &quot;status&quot; and possessions!
crying muh rightextremism!1
I don&#39;t understand why you People ruin  invaluable teachings with noisy silly music and useless and  scary pictures
This man is the living image of his own god. He saw lost kids and tried relentlessly to be the father of all.<br>Think about how limitless the suffering of someone with this much empathy must be.<br>Think about how much he accomplished, how many people he helped.<br>Dont waste your shot, in fact. He goddamn knows what he means.
Jordan Peterson will be remembered for eternity. His name will go down in history with the likes of Aristotle and Socrates.

Thanks a lot for the video ! <br>But it works very well without the background sound, kinda hurtful
I muted and made it! yay!

Create a better version of yourself to mentally compete against and try to out-work it. Like say your better self did 100 push-ups today, then you go do 120. You win today. That&#39;s growing.

You should live here where I am at Jordan, and hear and witness just how much of an Asshole, those who think they are as a king or queen of the INSIDE  and their ongoing confiscation of humanities GOOD freedoms because of their jealousies and how the INNER FOLD NEVER hold themselves accountable in their own laziness or whatever issue they are trying to BLAME those who don&#39;t fit in with their wicked ways. THe WORLD the Flesh, and the DEVIL. In truth because of my experience from their so-called RULERSHIP this is what the INNERFOLD is more so about; THE DEVIL.

#JordanPeterson #motivation2study #motivation #studymotivation",25130,781,26,2023-05-29T03:00:01Z,"Jordan Peterson is a Positively Inspirational Motivating Person
I think it was about time I grew up and have a change of heart. Jordan Peterson helped me when I first encountered him now 5 years ago, and I loved his courses. But I turned my back on him when I saw that he did not agree with feminism, climate change, or race and gender studies. Everything that I stood for. Or veganism for that matter. I will die a leftist, if not even radical. I left some comments a while ago insulting Peterson, and being judgemental. I would like to apologize. Peterson was the first intellectual I listened to for pure pleasure, and I feel ashamed I treated him like this. Even though I think many times the problem is the system, I do think now it is also up to the individual‚Äôs responsibility. Maybe we can be who we wanna be and overcome our circumstances. Who knows? Responsibility. I am growing old and I long for a more balanced view. I think Peterson should not be censured. We need a plurality of thinkers and viewpoints. I still think Peterson should read more about the bonobos so that he can understand better sexuality, and to understand that it is actually natural. I still am shocked by what he said about Putin and leftists. But I think Peterson is a victim. He should not have been kicked out of university and other restrictions. It has gone a bit too far. It was his lifetime work. And I am sorry he reached that point. Peterson is a man far more intelligent than I am, and yet I have insulted him and treated him badly. I would like to apologize. I am sorry we live in a world where people cannot have important conversations without starting to hate one another. Although I dream of a very multicultural world, I can understand why some want to preserve the old one. I want to apologize for the childish behavior that I so regret now. It is not nice to mob people. I think Peterson should be a professor again.

I hope it is not too late to change myself. I am 23 years old and I do think there is still time.

Lesson I learned from this...Make a conscious decision everyday to set yourself up for success tomorrow, help tomorrow&#39;s you to reach the goals you are really hoping for on life, don&#39;t sleep on yourself, don&#39;t let yourself down
Absolutely amazing, blew my mind, it was like you were talking to me Mr. Peterson, so much respect to you, thank you!
Firstly, we can&#39;t work each seconds of our life cause the brain have to be relaxed some time, i agree with the fact that the youngsters waste too much time on their phones, me the first, but we can do both, an equal time between the phone or videogames and the study time. I also didn&#39;t understand the link between the time and the wasted money. (sorry if i made some mistake im a french and i trying to learn english üòÖ)
I like wasting time tho lol üòÖ
AMERICAN PSYCHO metaphors listen closely watch the movie you&#39;ll understand
I am wasting my time on Facebook üò¢. I try to stop most of the time but unfortunately When I use my phone, suddenly connect with social media. Finally, I waste two or three hours üò¢.
I think part of the reason why I will continue to &quot;waste&quot; time is because I enjoy it and I appreciate the fact that life still goes on whether I spend my night studying/planning my days or watching self-help videos on youtube or chatting away with my friends. While I absolutely don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for everyone to be like me, I DO think that the people that are &quot;inherently&quot; like me with this mindset should not be compelled to start worrying about things that were previously of no concern to them. Of course, with the way I&#39;m wording this, this could be applied to every person on the planet. <br><br>But what I&#39;m trying to say is that some people are okay with just being 50% efficient, and they would like to maintain that efficiency but are not eager to increase it. Especially when it only affects themselves and not other people directly. <br><br>In my case, it&#39;s a bit due to the fear of change. I am also not willing to get rid of this fear, because I feel as if it helps me stay being the person that I am. And I like staying the same because who doesn&#39;t love a bit of consistency in this ever-changing world.<br><br>Anyways I almost completely agree with everything this man said, especially what he said near the beginning about writing, it&#39;s always a shocker how powerful literacy and effective communication can be.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> - Very kind and empowering words.
Love Peterson, however this promotes good but also ignites that even if your life is good it fosters the possibility it isn&#39;t good enough thus creating a life of emptiness there could be more when we have it all. Coming to the end realizing it was good and spent years chasing a void that that was falsely created by doubting what GOD has provided where we are.

&quot;You are far more important than you think&quot; this touched me. Bless Dr. Peterson! He is a man with passion and love
I calculated the hours I have spent on my phone (on social media) and found out that I most definitely have wasted about a third of my time a year. It is ao mindblowing that by just spending a few hours a day on something so useless as social media makes me worried for myself, for my generation and older and younger generations.

He said terrible things about women. He is an incel. He want women to only have kids and don&#39;t live their lives. He is a DISGUSTING misogynist. Like many men. They pretend like they are supporting to biology but actually they are irritating from independent women. He is a hypocrite and a liar.

Q&A is a television discussion program that focuses mostly on politics but ranges across all of the big issues that set Australians thinking, talking and debating.

It is driven by interaction: Q&A provides a rare opportunity for Australian citizens to directly question and hold to account politicians and key opinion leaders in a national public forum and Q&A is broadcast live so that not only the studio audience but also the wider audience can get involved.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences.

It‚Äôs impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we‚Äôre committed to giving participants a fair go.

In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

I was jealous of everyone for years because of my insecurities and weaknesses. But then I made a New Year resolution to end it, because I realized something. I do not believe in society anymore. I say two words to ultimately eliminate the self-doubt that tries to attack me: screw norms. <br><br>I&#39;m 27, still live at home, having <i>never</i> moved out. I have never had a girlfriend or a date, and I don&#39;t even have a driver&#39;s license. I have both a learning disability and ASD, and sometimes I say unfiltered things or act weird in social moments. I assume my ASD makes me &quot;less normal.&quot; I don&#39;t have too many friends now that I&#39;ve graduated from college and most of my friends have left town. My coworkers all seem to fit in; I usually stand out. I used to feel like a misfit at work, but now I realize that it&#39;s not a big deal. It&#39;s just they&#39;re not my people, they&#39;re each other&#39;s only. If my ASD makes them not like me enough, that&#39;s their problem. Sure, I don&#39;t have a great filter, but it doesn&#39;t define me; nobody is perfect. I don&#39;t care if people find me weird or annoying. I don&#39;t care that my both my sisters have boyfriends and started dating at 16 while I&#39;ve always been single. I don&#39;t care that I can&#39;t drive. I don&#39;t care that I appear dopey because of my learning disability. I don&#39;t care that I graduated high school at <i>TWENTY.</i> I don&#39;t care that I seem slow and helpless and do better with a guide than by myself (my boss basically said that to my face). I don&#39;t care that I still live with my mom. I don&#39;t care that I went to a small charter school than the &quot;superior&quot; public school that has many more activities, adventures, and organizations. I don&#39;t care about any of my weaknesses; I still have confidence in myself. It doesn&#39;t matter what others think of me, it&#39;s what I think of myself that matters. I will never fall for society&#39;s tricks again; society is buIIshit, and that would explain our government and political leaders. I say &quot;SCREW NORMS!&quot; I am absolutely fine the way I am, I say confidently. I am not a loser. A disabled man who doesn&#39;t match standards, yes, but not a loser. There is nothing wrong with being different. Different is good. Normal is boring.
His talks not scripted maybe basic. How he can never miss a lick and having all the to my opinion is one of the few most intelligent people ever.
If Jordan could just stick to psychology like in this video, he could be much more influential
I was far too nice, always saying yes, in a job about 5 years ago. When I had a problem at work one time, my boss did not back me. I could not stay much longer after that. They were told exactly what I thought before I walked out on them. Lesson learned for sure ‚ù§
Men make others eunuchs to do gods work
This is amazing!
You know what‚Äôs funny is I genuinely don‚Äôt care what people think. So that‚Äôs not my problem, my problem is what people do because of how they think of me. That leaks into my life. Them judging to the point where they take steps to interfere with my life. That‚Äôs the problem. So now, I‚Äôm forced to care how people think so it doesn‚Äôt effect my life, whether that‚Äôs in the workplace or family because I don‚Äôt want to be gossiped about, to the point where determinations are made about me with management or whatever. I just want to not talk to people, but instead I have to act dumb, ask of things like a kid who feels like they‚Äôre being a burden. Anyone else feel this way? If I stand my ground, it gets worse.
Brilliant
I love this guy! Genius.

Words like these breed ammunition and defence inside of you, to tackle the bullies, the backstabbers and the envious we encounter as soon as we try and make our way in the world as young adults. Stand up straight people! God bless Dr Peterson. ‚úäüíú

Love listening, he&#39;s so smart, so handsome.
Jordan is a very smart man, but he often explains how to take the long route to solving certain personal issues. Everything he‚Äôs trying to solve in this talk (to stop caring what other people think) can be solved by true, deeply rooted self- love and self-acceptance. True self-love is essentially valuing yourself and loving yourself and despite having your insecurities, you decide to accept them as making you unique and special and those insecurities give you strength, empathy and understanding. Laughing at your own flaws and being deeply secure with yourself despite your inevitable flaws, can be the most attractive thing a person can do. Through self- love and acceptance practices and meditation, you can dissolve the ego, which dissolves the inner life narrative that causes a roller coaster of emotions, getting a rush when you feel validated and a rush when you feel ostracized by a group.
If i may, could I know the sorce this video was compiled from?
Encouraging and insightful words.
cut that music. its so pathetic
I rarely care about what people think. I do worry about what they are doing!
I experienced this last night. Needed this video
Especially stop caring about what you think.
Hes brilliant---I like some of his teachings but for someone who doesn&#39;t believe in God he sure uses God&#39;s name in vain. Praying he comes to Christ.
I know a person right now who CRAVES attention. And doesn&#39;t care how he gets is. I just wish he would listen to you ! You Are a God send for me right now. Thank you!
I find it so damn hard to say what I really feel when someone puts me down and then I go home and become resentful. It&#39;s exactly like Dr. Peterson says. I needed to hear this a long time back.
I needed this!
Where is the original video
Be cunning as a snake, with the face of an angel.
I really needed this advice thank
BRILLIANT!!!!
If as small children we get threatened by a big parent, we stay quiet for our own safety. That can stay with us for a long time.
You, Jordan, always bring up hypothetical scenarios where the &quot;you person&quot; is male...example, you speak of &quot;your wife,&quot; etc. I wouldn&#39;t object or feel confused if you said &quot;your husband,&quot; etc. Of course, one can imagine nowadays day that that scenario involves a lesbian couple. Yet somehow, I don&#39;t believe you meant it that way.
Dr Peterson why this background annoying music ?
He looks depressed...",PT10M19S

No. In the name of Jesus Christ that would be wrong. Ask the aliens about Jesus christ. What do they know?
Life is difficult. No argument. But compared to what? Not living. Not a good comparison in my humble opinion.
What type of personality wants you to believe you are born to suffer? Obviously he&#39;s listening to western society.... <br><br>No, people aren&#39;t born to suffer, they&#39;re born to thrive. A narcissist, sociopath, or psychopath tells you to accept suffering, so they aren&#39;t called out when they&#39;re the cause of your suffering. It&#39;s about protecting yourself from suffering, which is where rights come in. It isn&#39;t about seeking human rights, but is about understanding them so you can thrive and know what to protect at all times... for the sake of thriving...<br><br>Peterson almost brought himself up to the right path at the end, but not quite... The labeled personality patterns labeled above want to disarm you so that you cannot protect yourself from them. When you protect yourself from them, then you thrive... and they cannot stand it. They are the cause of suffering, period. Don&#39;t call them out, and they succeed in generating more suffering, without consequence.
Difference between the meaning of life and a symphony is that someone created a symphony, and life is about you following your innate path, not allowing another to make your path align with theirs as they see fit...harmony comes with respecting another&#39;s wishes and how your life can enhance theirs, not as someone else created for you to follow...
You need to teach the world to be a philanthropist
Be a monster precisely.  Anyone who makes the astonishing amount of money that he does without the corresponding philanthropy is a hypocrite.  So yes, he truly has become a wilful ignorant to the plight of men and women, fellow citizens blah ü§Æ
You don&#39;t need to carry a cross on your back to have a meaningful life...
‚ÄúCompare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.‚Äù ~ Jordan B. Peterson
Peterson is a pill popping degenerate. He was tossed by his university in Toronto for being a babbling mess. He was high constantly. He drools on his expensive suits and cries over nothing. He should be institutionalized for his own safety.
I am educated enough to understand exactly what professor petersons content in his talks is getting at. Not everyone fits in with the criteria as there word hoard is not as expanded as the likes of peterson or especially a genius like William s Burroughs can with words, maybe taking a leaf from proffesor Brian Cox who talks in layman quantum physics to a baby and the baby understands. I&#39;m not saying change his syntax tweak it so that the prime audience of his message are just those types they do not know why they are demoralised or disillusioned or what not. We are born to suffer, so we endure and accept the fact that it is all a by product of function. We are left with little choice in essence and i personally struggled my way to age 42 and I&#39;ve been addicted to heroin 24 years, benzos for 15 now and pregablin to top it off, so I am enduring the absolute misery because action is as scary as inaction. My point is he would do better in reaching deciples accrued to him by speaking their language in written word too. Much love to all those suffering especially when you are juggling multiple drug dependent&#39;s. Time for another crack pipe goodbye horses
&quot;be a monster&quot;  is advice from a psychopath.
Yes, becoming that civilized MONSTER
Thank you Dr. peterson. Ive learned so much from you. Recently put into practice the idea of planning the day I want to have. I just had a wonderful weekend with my husband as a result. He was over the moon happy . I will eagerly await hearing more from you.ü§ó
Life is suffering! We are born already suffering, nonetheless, there is one option get tougher
All hands are equal when all they have to give is equally-equal.
Thanks Prof for sharing ur wisdom!, this aligns to me pretty well at this point of my life.
I suggest that at times, we are all monsters. Example: In January Jordan claimed on ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience‚Äù podcast that being transgender is a result of a ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù and similar to ‚Äúsatanic ritual abuse,‚Äù and suggested that acceptance of the trans community is a sign that ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs collapsing.‚Äù
i love how you always talk about suffering but you never talk about how suffering is supposed to be apart of our life, suffering is supposed to be a make or break and even if you break you were supposed to break..etc etc time and the world is weird and beautiful, so glad i found you when i did what a great humble and generous man you are jordan my friend, i know how emotionally connected you are to your work so thank you kind sir

Parental Trauma in a World of Gender Insanity | Miriam Grossman MD | EP 347,"Watch Jordan Peterson's ""Vision & Destiny"" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality ‚Äî with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Miriam Grossman discuss the grief and trauma associated with the Transgender movement, not just for those transitioning, but for the parents and families who now find themselves shunned and alienated if they refuse to affirm their own child's delusion. They also go into detail on the history of the ideology, the monstrosity of Dr. John Money, and his horrendous failed experiment on which he built his doctrines.

Miriam Grossman MD is a physician, author, and public speaker. Before gender ideology was on anyone‚Äôs radar, she warned parents about its dangers in her 2009 book, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Teaching My Child WHAT?‚Äù Dr. Grossman has been vocal for many years about the capture of her profession by ideologues, leading to dangerous and experimental treatments on children and betrayal of parents. Dr. Grossman was featured in the Daily Wire‚Äôs hit documentary ‚ÄúWhat Is A Woman?‚Äù The author of four books, her work has been translated into eleven languages. After graduating with honors from Bryn Mawr College, Dr. Grossman attended New York University Medical School.  She completed an internship in pediatrics at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, and a residency in psychiatry through Cornell University Medical College, followed by a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. Dr. Grossman is board certified in psychiatry and in the sub-specialty of child and adolescent psychiatry.

Jordans arguments are common sense where as proponents of trans arguments are nonsense, they&#39;re denying reality and expect everyone to follow them down this macabre other non-reality. I&#39;m extremely reluctant to go there, I refuse to go there, I don&#39;t like it
My heart goes out to all that are affected by this horrific ordeal, I have children, but not from this generation and I pray for each one of you and I pray that the Lord gives his love and guidance if you believe in Him. Trust in Him for guidance and give trust in Him to help you and these precious children to let them understand that they are being deceived and The Lord says in the Bible that this is not the right  way, God made a human not anyone else as a man or woman, follow Christ Jesus, not all the propaganda on the TV or internet!
We are seeing all these lies being told about this subject, this is putr evil!
She is 100% correct. Omg! She just wrapped up my life for the past 5 years. Except i been fighting on my own. I have had no help. Tried therapist. He just wanted to push the trans. I stopped that. Been throwing so much info at her. I think i somewhat got through. But she is still holding on to the ideology. Just shifted. This has hurt an already hurting family so much. I dont think we can get back what we lost to this.
Only Jesus free this problems, this are spiritual problems because we had walk away from God principles.
I did an experiment with my very young son. I put a doll and a truck in the toy box. He refused the doll. My husband laughed,  told you so. Boys are hard wired that way.
We are living in a world were many innocent parents are being forced to pay the proven abusive parent to literally abuse the minor children, including SA, including the dad&#39;s Willy up the child&#39;s private part or rectum and he talks non stop about gender confision and parents who go along with it. Really????  Dr Peterson do you honestly think parents who aren&#39;t system abuse victims being forced literally shouldn&#39;t be responsible without famous people like you baby spoon feeding it to them non stop while like everyone ignoring those many victims who are given no choices whatsoever, other than suicide I guess. The only way not to pay these actual abusers to abuse is to not be alive anymore.
This hits hard. I&#39;ve never thought about parental trauma but it is surely there! Thank you for naming it and giving a voice to those parents. I don&#39;t have children yet, but for a past few years I started to question myself: what would I do if my future child decides to transition? And I was experiencing an unknown fear just thinking of that. Now I understand it better.
Anyone else notice it&#39;s mainly white kids transitioning. It&#39;s a way to go from alleged &quot;oppressor&quot; to a member of a protected class. The whole worldview is wrong.
For medical truth about trans kids, go to the American College of Pediatricians
Gender Theory is a psychological war against the young generation designed to confuse and destabilize their identity at their most vulnerable mental development state so they can be easily controlled. Aristotle said Give me a child until he&#39;s 7 and I will show you the man. Indicating that you can shape the personality and character of the man or woman easily during those 7 years of their life. Now why would sane Americans trust their kid&#39;s mental development to people with Mental Disorders? Those people experience high levels of stress, anxiety and suicidal thoughts so they need help for themselves, they can&#39;t help your children.
She said the young couple was &quot; uneducated&quot; ... As if that has anything to do with their decisions. Lets ALL remember : it was the so called &quot; educated &quot; ones that burned their son&#39;s penis off !!!  Its the so called &quot; educated&quot; ones that are pushing this whole LIE now . So yeah. Lets not label/ judge people by their lack of education .  They were manipulated and are victims of the &quot;educated&quot;.
And the crime rates will skyrocket. What is the point of life anymore? Why should we be civil? This society does not entice me to be civil and help to make it prosper. I don&#39;t want to support this society of demons. I have had enough of you.
I&#39;m praying for this beautiful country America people need to do some soul searching because this president has missed the mark of God we need to pray üôè for this amenastrateion for there evil dees.

The whole agenda spread across the society covered under &amp; in the name of acceptance. The question is acceptance of what? <br><br>We can see the adaptation of law, profesional advice from science, medical knowledge of human biological concept to be presented to fit the narrative to reach what ...? To reach the stage when the pedophiles are able to take children away from the (minded) parents while parents will try to protect them and raised them with common sense.
I thought ‚ÄúQ‚Äù meant ‚Äúqueer‚Äù. As in the movie, Queer As Folk, with Patrick, Denzel, and John.
Stop poisoning your kid&#39;s brains  stop torturing them do not let any one to change their genders ,, it is a CRIME  to let any school teacher to pollute your kid&#39;s  minds as you are pushing diseases like AIDS ,Hepatitis and dirty Gonorrhoea  to their innocent bodies ...OH GOD clean planet earth from those devilish  creatures   who are spreading dirty rules to our kids ..
I am not American, I am from Asia, not that it‚Äôs relevant . I admire everyone resisting the temptation of WOKEISM. Gender ideology is one of those things WOKE ideology wants to impose onto the world. The good thing though is that many countries out there do not tolerate LGBTQ+. The Muslims and traditional Christians will never accept such ideology. It‚Äôs not helping people, specially the youth, to affirm their delusional ways. On contrary, we should feel compassion and help those suffering to get real help. I understand that in the US it‚Äôs difficult to find decent grounded doctors that have not fallen into this WOKEIMS. But I am sure there are. Keep strong US and keep fighting for the TRUTH of GOD and not for the made up truth of a few men and women.  Stay the course !
Too many ads ! I pay for the premium version but the imbedded ones are annoying

I would argue gender dysphoria stems from attachment trauma. It&#39;s traumatising for parents to hear their kid wants to transition. But it could well be that they - unwillingly in most cases - contributed to their kid experiencing attachment trauma. Since much of the attachment wiring happens subconsciously, this is a really tricky issue to tackle.
Isn&#39;t the US still a democracy?<br><br>What&#39;s going on?<br><br>Parents band together. Form coalitions. Protest. Sue all of the bodies involved in the madness including all the individuals involved in the entire process.<br><br>Mske it a class action suit like the one brought against the tobacco industry about the hiding of the addictive narure of nicotine.<br><br>Impeach elected officials who supprt the madness. Take control of your government. Get together in streets, burroughs all the way to the national level.<br><br>Bring both cuvil and criminal suits against every single person involved in the process.<br><br>Overhaul your educational system from kindergarten to university with all the dangerous frustrated gender fluidity extremists.<br><br>Boycott all bysinesses including actors and singers that support the madness.<br><br>And, it is madness.
I&#39;m so tired of trying to make sense to these gender fluidity people.<br><br>I really am. Can we just go to war and see who wins and remains alive? Yes, seriously, I mean it. It&#39;s insane and, I&#39;m just tired of the obvious lies.<br><br>Just thinking of it makes me feel I&#39;ll lose my mind. When I get like that, I feel intense and need to be violent.<br><br>Let&#39;s just go to war and see those of us who are left. Please.
i am fed up with hearing about all this rubbish. if some one is not happy with the way they was born. when they are old enough and earning there own money they can seek surgery. until then shut up.<br> god made boys with a little bit of sting , he had a bit to much so he left a little thing.<br>god made girls with a little bit of lace. he didn&#39;t have enough so he left a little space.
This new transgender epidemic of today, is like the Goth and punk trends of yesteryear... <br>On steroids <br>With a loaded gun. <br><br>Back then &quot; it was just a phase&quot; <br>But today, it has legislative backing that allows it to demand to be recognized. Imagine how many goth kids would have <i>destroyed</i> their parents, if the law allowed them to
MOVE TO RU SSIA
NON LIVING THINGS ONLY have a gender, masculine or feminine. La table, Le soleil. The table is feminine, but it doesnt mensurate. The sky, the wall, the river...masculine, Not males. You can look at two bears, or hyenas, or birds, or frogs, or your dogs, and know one is male &amp; the other is female (sex) yet observe no gender.<br><br>Those trans demon baphomets are neither drag queens, nor women. They are the image of the beast. Like demons u cant tell their sex, like satan they are proud &amp; deceiving. This is not gay, this is satanic.
THE WORST PART is as a parent, is this trans thing does NOT MAGICALLY MAKE THEIR KIDS HAPPY.. AND THE LONG TERM DAMAGE BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY IS LONG TERM. That doctor is right about parents.. I would KILL for my kids and give them my heart if they needed it.. and I‚Äôm glad my kids are older now because I would go off my head if anyone talked to my kids about this rubbish.. I must say.. if my 2 year old who wasn‚Äôt influenced by the contagion, said they were the opposite sex and held that belief.. I would definitely help my child whatever that looks like.. BUT KIDS ARE JUMPING ON THIS CRAP BECAUSE THE PUBLIC ARE APPLAUDING THESE KIDS, MAKING THEM HEROES, GIVING THEM ATTENTION AND MORE POWER THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE.. Of course kids are saying they are trans when the feedback is not only positive.. it‚Äôs celebrating it..
I was just thinking‚Ä¶.I was hated to be a girl and still I do bcz let‚Äôs be honest is not easy to be a women after all and is true all this is trauma for sure bcz I was raised by me grandparents and my grandmother make me whore and curse me and everything bcz she was an alcoholic women‚Ä¶and i was just a child all this shit affect me till now i think these humans like me we never be normal but all we just can do is just to accept how we are and make our life‚Äôs better as an adults but is hard so I asking myself is this devil do all these horrible things to us or we choose to live like this I mean reincarnation‚Ä¶to learn ‚Ä¶at this point is so difficult and complicated to understand this whole life but I know one think ‚Ä¶.I was struggling so much with depression and all bcz of these negative thoughts and when I start to give up on these thoughts everything is getting better i mean im at peace with myself‚Ä¶mabye that‚Äôs the point we attracted what we thinking ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èbut these thoughts always try to get me don‚Äôt get me wrong but twhen we experience these horrible things in our life‚Äôs is hard to accept ourselves is a hard battle in our minds for sure but I think through these things we learn and some of us we fail we give up and mabye we have to choice again is so complicated I wrote so much but hope you understand my point ü•πand also this earth is not a save place at all and never was that‚Äôs the pure true !üòê
Denial of reality is thrillingly transgressive--until it isn&#39;t any more. The next move has to out transgress the previous one.
Imagine being at the bottom of the ocean, stuck with a bunch of diverse people having panic attacks.
The chikdren belong to God and poor you if you desive them! Its better for you if you put a stone around your neck says the Lord.
I was born with XXY chromosomes.  I&#39;m grateful I wasn&#39;t diagnosed until my 30&#39;s. It&#39;s a development disability, not intersex, and most people with this have an IQ of 70. Unfortunately people with this condition can easily be taken advantage of by the medical establishment and they are. Im lucky I was born high functioning however because at my age i need testosterone and to do that because of the extra chromosome the provider sends me to these butchers. I do have gender disphoria it sucks, its a big part of the condition. Its managable and I have a normal life. But, to get treating, correct treat bound to reality is not easy. <br>I feel for parent. I know exactly what happens in the gender support groups because my doctors telling go. In those group, they hate god and they very political charged. <br>People people legit condition who have spent years and years tranditioning all pushed out. People, real people with gender dysphoria have been alienated to pander to a devastated fad.
We small and strange people, we only see bits of life.  We have no crystal ball of truth, of the future.  God said we would not endure more than one day at a time.  Therefore, our identity is changing, depending on the group we belong to, the role we play, the friends we associate with, the belonging we seek.  Therefore, we can change our self-image and self-understanding many times.  It does not mean that we change from soul to soul...
I don&#39;t agree with a lot of things that Peterson says, but he has a lot of interesting things to share. His lectures were very interesting, especially before all this controversy with the Lgtb-etc-community. But what this psychiatrist is talking about, I learned about 15 years ago before this bs boom grew to this size and consequences. I wish people knew more, that they were more informed about this confusion that has been created, it is crazy to hear people not knowing what is woman or feeling fear of answer, people accepting that if you say that you perceive yourself as X or Y then you are. It is crazy, and the damage is irreparable, what they teach in some universities as an irrefutable truth and the misinformation is disproportionate levels.
Why can&#39;t I comment under any of these videos ?
When you see African leaders rejecting this ideology, it is because they have foresight, sadly courtesy of your society. This is what they are afraid of. If they seem radical in their total rejection and the laws seem like overreach, its because they know that their societies and indeed (now clear), your societies cannot contain the confusion, trauma, distress, disruption that this unnatural lifestyle produces. I am a Christian, and can say that this is more a spiritual battle of sinful mankind spitting in the face of their Creator. The very foundations of creation &#39;&#39;He made them male and female&#39;&#39;. In man&#39;s rebellion, we don&#39;t realize that the further away we move from God Almighty, the LESS human we become. About three years ago, I responded to a FB advert, the ones that simply pop-up on your timeline. The advert was from a Copenhagen Pride month group asking Africans to share their experiences and views of being LGBTQ+ in Africa. I responded, and you will see why my comment was summarily deleted off the face of facebook. Just three years ago people did not have the courage to speak out. And like Miriam says, parents themselves are hiding their identities for fear of backlash. I am relieved to see you discuss this topic. Thank you. <br>..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br>Africa should not exchange their bad practices with the West&#39;s abominable practices!<br><br>This is what I can say about this matter. It will probably be controversial to the world, but will be understood by the discerning.<br>I will speak from the African experience of body mutilation.<br><br>Long time ago, (and presently) some African societies had the practice called female circumcision. It was done as a rite of passage from girlhood to womanhood. Another practice is early marriage of girls to older men. Due to modernity and pressure, these practices are now banned in many African societies. Female circumcision was given the name Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). A lot of work is put into fighting this practice. Some people (communities) have discarded it, while in others, girls and women are either forced or due to cultural conditioning, willingly want to be cut. The women retain their ability to give birth, though sometimes painful and complicated.<br><br>This is where it gets controversial.<br><br>The same people who called us backward (And we agreed to discard these practices) - have now gone full circle and brought back worse practices against BOTH men and women, boys and girls in Western societies.<br><br>How? you ask.<br>1. Top surgery - Breast mutilation- cutting off both breasts for girls and women. Chest mutilation and insertion of plastic breasts for men/boys.<br>2. Bottom surgery - Genital/ reproductive organ mutilation by chopping off men&#39;s p&#39;s, and tearing out women&#39;s womb and v&#39;s.<br>3. Full body distortion - by administering body distorting/deforming drugs.<br><br>And so, just like female circumcision was changed to Female Genital Mutilation; Why not also change LGBT... and call it as it is - Full Body Mutilation and Deformity?<br><br>Again I ask those pushing this agenda; Should we discard our bad practices and adopt your abominable ones???<br>And yes, just like in Africa, the children &#39;agree&#39;. In the West, parents have literally been kicked out of the lives of their children, and their place taken by government, teachers and doctors. An industry minting millions has been created out of a mental challenge that will change the face of entire societies in the near future ( if Christ tarries). Some parents prod their children on, into this lifestyle so as to look &#39;fashionable&#39;. So I have to ask....Does anyone know what they are doing to these societies and families?<br><br>Scripture was right when it says this: Let us take humble heed.<br>Proverbs 14:12<br>There is a way that seems right to a man,<br>But its end is the way of death",PT1H39M27S

It is driven by interaction: Q&A provides a rare opportunity for Australian citizens to directly question and hold to account politicians and key opinion leaders in a national public forum and Q&A is broadcast live so that not only the studio audience but also the wider audience can get involved.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences.

It‚Äôs impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we‚Äôre committed to giving participants a fair go.

In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

watching them looking at their computers and don&#39;t focus with him is something very annoying fr

An exam was just shifted foward and threw me all out of balance... it&#39;s now 3 days away instead of a week away
thank you sir
So how do you focus...
Humans are a result of billions of years of evolution. And Script was invented just yesterday. Some of us are built to &quot;sit&quot; and study the entire day, and thankfully, most of us aren&#39;t. Not everyone has to be same. A couch potato bookworm (like me) doesn&#39;t have 1/10th the fitness of a woodcutter. I know i can ask ai to cut wood for me, but ai cannot exercise on my behalf. Sitting for long hours and continuously stressing the brain destroys the hormonal sanity of the body. / The speaker here is freely strolling around on his two legs, while advising others to sit down... üôÑ wondering if he tried sitting for 7 hours.
No lie, the app Freedom is really helpful. It basically disables your apps and internet. I lock a schedule from 4am to 5pm 6 days a week. Then you have no choice to open your textbook, go to the gym, meditate, clean, other productive stuff. I used to literally get nothing done and watch Netflix, porn, and YouTube, now I‚Äôm a study animal! One simple change and only takes maybe a week or two to fully adapt and accept psychologically. I wish I discovered it in college and law school instead of now trying out a new career but what‚Äôs done is done! Discipline is a bitch, this makes it almost automatic. üòä

Nope.  I am still not convinced that IQ tests are culturally neutral.  You can get better results in IQ tests from practicing them, you learn to recognise the patterns to look for of what the test is asking.  Some people simply choke at the idea of the IQ test, which could easily be culturally related.  That some groups do better could also be explained by a culture of more focus on education generally and a greater exposure to the &#39;language&#39; of IQ tests.
Peterson has a niche career.<br><br>He dresses up and says things that idiots want to hear.
I love how he worded that, &quot;there is no relation between intelligence and virtue&quot;<br>It can&#39;t be a crime if it isn&#39;t against the law. Morally neutral... I didn&#39;t know morality was dictated by the law, an intelligent person is MOST likely to take advantage of someones obliviousness or ignorance. It is the only benefit of being smart over being strong. Do not believe an intelligent person is not conniving.
Fascinating. I have always scored low in the IQ tests I have done, between 90 and 95. Yet after leaving school unqualified aged 15, I have had a career in precision engineering, been a teacher for 31 years, 21 as a Head of Computing and IT, and on retirement gaining a 2:1 Honours Philosophy degree at Edinburgh. I am not sure if that life story was predictable from my IQ scores.
What Jordan explained here sounds like pretty complicated stuff, but it really isn&#39;t. How he explained an application of statistics and later bemoaned, it is really no wonder that the single brain cell woke leftie becomes so incensed and on a rampage about things like IQ and it&#39;s distribution if you do not understand what intelligence is and how the market demands its use. They just clump it all together under one term - racism - and claim to be improving the world by promoting tolerance. Again, no wonder that doesn&#39;t work, because the issue is far more complicated than this poorly informed, so-called &#39;solution&#39;.
His comment about &quot;human value&quot; in the last 2mins of this video is so important, sometimes we forget what&#39;s really important in life. Thanks JP
:))) My  üíñ to Jordan Peterson! ...not to the debate!
when &quot;they&quot; finally realize...
The very last part.  Ive heard college grads say their degree made them a better person.  What total narcissistic nonsense.  JP breaks the narrative
‚ÑπÔ∏è
Damn he&#39;s good!!
Jews run the world because they are smart AF. Stupid people are jealous and therefore hate them. That&#39;s literally it.
There is something to do for everyone, they just won&#39;t necessarily like doing it. The &quot;bottom 10%&quot; could do menial work that does not require any sort of higher level cognition.
yes, i worked for a person with very high IQ but they were not very nice at all ... that in itself can be counterproductive and limit their possibilities ... what i saw was folks start practicing &quot;malicious obedience&quot; as a response
Ring the Bell Curve, and Jordan Peterson&#39;s followers will start salivating on cue, as a conditioned reflex, like Pavlov&#39;s dog.
I fear the &quot;holier than thou&quot; from JP.  Which 20 year old would think like him.  You Tube and the internet are full of &quot;Gurus&quot; like him.  He&#39;s a dime a dozen.  He sells god and money, hoping no one will catch him out.
Maybe there aren‚Äôt enough positions in society for all of the dumbest 10%, but there would be for some of them.
...&quot;significantly differently&quot;, liberal leftist pussyfooting...
It was on this topic that I became acquainted with Dr. Peterson a few years ago - and I didn&#39;t like what I heard.  It took listening to him many times before I accepted that he wasn&#39;t pushing an agenda harmful to anyone - but rather challenging men to step up and be good men.  I knew a minister who offended many people because he challenged men to be men of God and many folk misunderstood his thrust: they thought he was devaluing women. He wasn&#39;t - and neither is Jordan Peterson.<br><br>In that initial video - which wasn&#39;t the entire lecture, I didn&#39;t get to hear Dr. Peterson say that despite differences in performance by ethnic groups, intelligence does not indicate value. We lay-folk draw such conclusions - and we&#39;re wrong. Intelligence and wisdom are not the same thing.
In 2023 My banks have all closed,  need an app on phone to park my car.  Inland revenue is all online.  I don&#39;t carry a mobile. Cashless society.   All people in thier 60&#39;s - 70&#39;s,  did we say YES bring it on.
The Armed Forces won‚Äôt take you if your IQ is lower than 83. Well, a certain US Secretary of Defence, Robert McNamara, had no trouble bypassing that requirement at the height of the Vietnam War. He needed boots on Vietnam soil and he got them, the ‚Äòintellectually challenged‚Äô. That cannon fodder, which they disportionately became, became known as McNamara‚Äôs Morons. Few talk about it, or perhaps even know. That aside, Dr Peterson answered that ‚Äòminefield-of-a-question‚Äô, superbly.
Peterson sure tipped-toed around the original question.
The Left in comments are seething at being told their voter ‚Äúbase‚Äù (LOL) is naturally stupid.
It‚Äôs not 10%. Per Richard Haier, a full 26% of US population (330 million) have IQs of under 83. That‚Äôs 26% (86 million)!!
Many times, history proved that the ‚Äúopinions‚Äù of psychologists (concerning their assessments of high or low IQs) were not at all trustworthy.<br>  <br>From the book ‚Ä¶ THE LOST FAMILY ‚Ä¶ How DNA Testing is Upending Who We Are ‚Ä¶ author ‚Ä¶ Libby Copeland<br><br>Meanwhile, psychologists administered IQ tests to US Army recruits and concluded that ‚Äúrace‚Äù was linked to intelligence; conveniently, the racial hierarchy they discovered perfectly conformed to preexisting prejudices. Eugenics influenced the Immigration Act of 1924, which restricted the numbers of people coming from ‚Äúsocially inadequate‚Äù areas like eastern and southern Europe.
As the results of their theologies saturating the earth with human blood, the warring theologians credited their selves with having the highest of intelligence quotients. They swore that the messages they conveyed to the flocks, through words that they preached as truth ‚Ä¶ came straight from the creator of the universe, and they insinuated that intelligence couldn‚Äôt possibly achieve any higher goal than THAT. <br><br>From the book ‚Ä¶ The Seven Mysteries of Life ‚Ä¶ Exploration in Science and Philosophy ‚Ä¶ <br>Guy Murchie. ... <br><br>Of this period Erasmus sadly wrote: ‚ÄúWe were forever slaughtering each other for opinions that were mere guesswork‚Äîyet caused half of humanity to send the other half to the gallows or the stake‚Äîand for what?‚Äù <br><br>Science was virtually standing still because any man bold enough to do any scientific research or to admit any scientific discovery was taking a fearful risk. <br><br>Michael Servetus knew it‚Äîhe who discovered the circulation of blood and was burned at the stake at the request of Calvin. Giordano Bruno knew it, and was burned for agreeing with Copernicus that the earth moves around the sun. And Galileo, who discovered the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, barely escaped a similar fate by recanting on his knees.
We are going down a dark road, when everything is set around not hurting peoples feelings.
ill give him a flaw in his logic, most people havent done an iq test, so how the fuck does he know that 10% of people have an iq of less than 83? he doesnt ,
i have an iq of 162 and if anyone thinks this man is intelligent ,then your wrong ,pay attention to what he says? he says nothing just nonsense, going round in circles using words that make him seem clever, very deceptive, a fraud ,total mumbo jumbo, i bet he couldnt work out how to start an engine with no key?
How did Forrest Gump join the military?
JP: &quot;Race is difficult to define...&quot;<br><br>&quot;How?&quot;<br>-Elizabeth Warren
Wisdom is not connected to IQ.
Basically what he is saying ,for you people with an IQ high enough to understand is yes race is a very pertinent Factor in IQ and the blacks are definitely on the bottom the same as Jews are on the top which Jordan acknowledged but he for obvious reasons did not acknowledge the fact that blacks are on the bottom. The man is very intelligent to have done that. If you wonder why blacks are 13% of America&#39;s population yet they commit 70% of all violent crimes I just gave you the answer and it is because of a low IQ
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY&amp;t=14m45s"">14:45</a>  Good point.
Wrong.    At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY&amp;t=1m00s"">1:00</a> he put his hand over his face to figure out how he was going to get out of answering this question.  JP then talked for 20 min. and never answered  the question.  He concluded this with:  &quot;IQ does not measure a person&#39;s worth as a human being&quot;.   Good one.  Ok,  but this is a great answer to a question that was never asked.  The question was IQ and race.  He said Jews are one standard deviation ahead.  Ok,  again, but so what.  No one gives a shit.  Not the issue.  He screwed us for 20 min. by side stepping the question.  Conclusion: this question can never be answered by anyone.  And we are about to find out the cost for this.
Jews are the people of the Book. It is just they think only Moses is to be credited for that book, they stopped reading the other works.
Iq test doesn&#39;t work on villager ethnicities who doesn&#39;t have western education
If what he says is true, approximately 35-40% of blacks are not able to join the military.  How sad.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY&amp;t=11m05s"">11:05</a>  ... That is roughly 700 million people if the world population numbers can be believed. That is two entire USA populations. I don&#39;t want to even fathom how to deal with that...
I score high in IQ tests, my father scores a little lower, he&#39;s way smarter than me. He has an extremely successful life, unlike me. I mostly rely on other people for basic stuff.<br>I think what&#39;s more important than having a high IQ is experience.
If you can talk about athletic differences why not intellect?
I exhibited significant anti-social and aggressive behavior at the age of 4. I started school approximately 2 weeks after my 4th birthday, my vivid childhood episodic memory , to this day enables me to recall my  behavior  at that age. I can remember mistreating other children but can‚Äôt remember what if any rational I had at the time to justify such actions . Now as an 33 year old adult  however I have eschewed violence consistently for over  2 decades violent behavior ceased being manifested from the age of 9 onwards . So one is most certainly not doomed to a life of persistent and sustained aggressive anti social behavior as he is suggesting at the beginning of the video..
There you have it. The difference between having a black and white reasoning and having a multi layered infinite way of thinking.
Clearly a racist.  Ignorance on full display
the study mr juden peterstein sited was massively flawed and has since been debunked.<br>the average ashkanazi jews iq is not any higher than your typical western european.
He definitely has an high IQ

Jordan Peterson - The most PROBLEMATIC intellectual of our time,"Jordan Peterson is easily the most problematic public intellectual of our time. From his assault on the LGBT community (what he calls the post-modern neo-marxist types) to his defense of traditional christian values. I examine it in this video.

A good video overall however if I were to apply the same rationale that you have used here to discredit Peterson , that is, a few specific example of quoting papers but him being wrong about what they actually say then you would have to criticise yourself for the exact same thing. It seems that you have employed the exact same tactic you accuse him of. It is false of you to present the argument on the gender pay gap as an anti-feminist one. Although it could be fairly demonstrated that someone may choose to justify their anti-feminism with this argument in part it is not true to present this as Petersons argument he does not use it justify an anti woman position. I would say that you have not read the paper. You say that it using a multi varied analysis still determines the pay gap to be 9% this is true but the paper does not conclude that the 9% discrepancy is due to discrimination against woman, it does suggest that this is a possible reason and admittedly the authors seem to believe it the probable cause but they do then discuss the possibility of the difference being due to psychological factors between men and woman which is precisely what he says (although they say this does not account for all of the unaccounted for discrepancy and of course the remainder is indeed discrimination but again this is actually what Peterson says as he never denies the existence of the discrimination) As well the paper precisely states that the biggest discrepancies are due to occupation choice, relocation, child rearing, the industry you work in pretty much all of the things he says. Please see below three quotes in the authors words directly lifted from their own conclusion.<br><br>Quotes from paper below.<br><br>The persistence of an unexplained gender wage gap suggests, though it does not prove, that labor-market discrimination continues to contribute to the gender wage gap, just as the decrease in the unexplained gap we found in our analysis of the trends over time in the gender gap suggests, though it does not prove, that decreases in discrimination help to explain the decrease in the gap. <br><br>Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes, and we have reviewed an impressive array of recent research suggesting that there are indeed notable gender differences along this dimension. While male advantages in some factors, like risk aversion and propensity to negotiate or compete, may help to explain not only some of the unexplained gender wage gap but also gender differences in occupations and fields of study, it is important to note that women may have advantages in some other areas, like interpersonal skills.<br><br> The notable finding from this exer- cise is that, in each case, gender differences in psychological factors account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences. Thus, this source of the gender gap, based at least on what we know at this point, while worth pursuing, does not appear to provide a silver bullet in our understanding of gen- der differences in labor-market outcomes
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
He didn&#39;t say atheists are murderes tbh ...he said that atheists take decisions based on morality as defined by the society.<br><br>And the fact that you are the only creator saying that there was no mention of f legislation on someones speech not existing in bill c16 makes me want to read it myself because even the trans people that debated him directly did not put this point forth.
People always remember, even if someone cites scientific papers, that doesnt mean you should believe that person blindly. You have to dig deeper and see the experimental setup used by those papers to actually see its merit. Its jp or pranav, dont be fooled by fancy english and their attempts to create a narrative through selective assembly of &quot;facts&quot;. Be safe out there. And most importantly, &quot;trust, but verify&quot;.
Okay so this man made some some very good arguments because he is using the same fallacies that he is saying jordan peterson uses. Well firstly jordan peterson never said pay gap never existed. He also said in that interview that gender is one of th emany factors that determin the pay gap. I think this man&#39;s argument on the relegious front were pretty solid. Theism can never be defendend in an argument but what jbp says is that without a god living is difficult so that is why you should believe in god. I mean if you are a theist then there could be a lot of advantage for you. Jbp says that you become responsible by being a theist and by bearing your cross. Lots of knowledge can be derived from the biblical stories i.e same with the stories inany other religion. But jbp&#39;s argument on if god really existed are weak. But this man&#39;s interpretation of the c-16 is hillarious. Well there is a propoganda section in the bill c-16 which compells you to use gender pronouns in a certain way as to not offend a certain community. Well this is shit and this is an attack on freedom of speech and there are other arguments also on the lgbtq issue. I mean fluid gender identity will result in the fallout of society. Jordan peterson was invited to senate hearing by rhe candian court twice to speak on the bill. That explains his competence and research on the subject. As for climate change you can listen to bjorn lomborg for that. Overall apart from the relegious part this whole video was full of bullshit lies and fallacies.
Atleast someone was have same critical view as mine about jp ..but i to afraid to explain to someone because his followers was abusive and toxic.
There was also a series of talks with Dr.Sam Harris where the latter defended the atheist‚Äôs position very well.

You know the world has gone mad when we start calling people like JP problematic
I would like to correct a part, where you said Jordan Peterson called atheist &quot;murde***&quot;, he didn&#39;t called people who believed themselves as being atheist that way, he said that if you really where to be one, you could very well be a m******. In other words, deep down, you are still a (whatever religion you where before) even tho you distanced yourself from the prayers or even never prayed (the society continuing to fonction on those values anyway). Because it is so profoundly founded within you, that it&#39;s even hard to even break out of it. And maybe you shouldn&#39;t really break out of it. <br><br>But I think it&#39;s okay to challenge religion, especially when it&#39;s being dictated words for words by non-thinkers who claim to be always right no matter what. <br>However I also believe, if you ever &quot;wished&quot; or &quot;hoped&quot; for something in your life to happen, you are, in fact, faithful and therefore a believer. Even tho you don&#39;t put a definite orthographe on what god or definition that must be. <br><br>I personally call myself a human who happen to believe, maybe agnostic is the most appropriate word for it.
Pranay you are right on jordan but ironically bad and toxic part of feminist are on front line who are already privileged and comes from higher class abuse the privileges for their own gain and feed their ego spreading hatred towards men worldwide but real feminism isn&#39;t helping empowering lower class and poor womens and misguiding them to hate mens and become Supreme as individual.  Therefore guys like jordan appears to be defenders and Nothing else.
Hi @ScienceIsDope, i think u being an atheist has somewhat made your opinion a little biased. Being a fanboy of somebody is mistake that no one should make and will give you credit that you have stopped fanboying on jordan peterson but in the same video I think you were fanboying for people like richard dawkins, will etc. While my perception of jordan peterson as also changed but I think your critique is not nuanced enough. Anybody wo speaks on &#39;god&#39; should read a good amount of philosophy and what I think is that worldview matters a lot. Problem with western atheists or theists alike is that there is a Judeo-Christian world view in which they operate(which jordan peterson points out but has failed to read other philosophies). I also somewhat agree with his critique of new age atheists (like dawkins and harris), specifically dawkins. While the books written by dawkins are really good they fail to compete somebody like carl jung (which jordan points out in his discussion with susan <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syP-OtdCIho)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syP-OtdCIho)</a>. Atheism (nastik) in indian context is mostly defined by charvaka philosophy (you can check this video for basics of indian philosophy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4sYkNBErpU)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4sYkNBErpU)</a>. There are other eastern (middle eastern ) philosophies also which should be read. I am not saying in any shape of form that indian (or eastern) philosophies are best, but to know different worldviews you should read everything and then make a conclusion.
Dude I used to be a fan of this channel, but this video is extremely disingenuous. Firstly if you had an ounce of intellectual honesty, you would call out the ridiculousness of the trans agenda and how unscientific it is. It denies basic biology and how the governments across the west are caving in to the lgbt mob and introducing laws. Secondly how is JP the most Problematic intellectual, clearly a clickbait title , there are literal extremist ideologues who travel the world espousing violence, you haven‚Äôt given one reason why he is the worst. There are Marxist intellectuals who call for complete state control of resources. Seems like you have a personal left leaning bias , which is fine, but dunking on right leaning individuals under the garb of science is quite dishonest and misleading.
Like anything üòÇüòÇ<br>He talks generally about western world and their shit.... And for that perspective he is true<br>But whenever he takes account asia or our culture or history, he&#39;s as bad as a dumbass<br>We have different problems nd different perspectives about almost everything <br>Just common sense.... people be arguing in comments for no reason üíØ
About Bill C16, it indeed doesnt obligate people to use the preferred pronouns but the protest of JP was because the university of torinto obliged him to use the perferred pronouns, as for God, everyone has a different interpretation in belief I‚Äôm not a believer myself but in JP‚Äôs vieuw god is in morals and therefore everyone believes in his own ‚ÄòGod‚Äô so he doesn‚Äôt define god as a supreme being or anything but actually tries to say that everyone believes in something that he specifies as a god. Now research about the gender paygap is very hard because everyone has different personalities and characteristics so you can‚Äôt really make statics about that and multiple studies can have completely different results. However this video is great criticism about JP!
I just buy his book ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤üò£üò≠
Indians needs to save this men! He is a gem üíé ‚ù§ please make videos like this and empower us üôè
For a person tooting about rationality and logic all the time, calling Peterson the &quot;most&quot; problematic intellectual is such a bias.
I&#39;m guessing he got the idea for climate change from a wise man ... &quot;he who cannot be named&quot;.....from India!! üòÇ
Next video on Ben Shapiro
Regarding free speech and LGBTQ, you told that bill C 16 is created to protect members of the group. But, what is &quot;misgendering&quot;? I mean one choosing not to call a physically male person as a transwomen with an appropriate pronoun can be considered as &quot;hate speech&quot;. Till now hate speech generally means &quot;making comments or words that hurt a group or a person&quot; but with this bill, doesn&#39;t it count to hate speech, by choosing not to use the pronouns that one is being forced to follow, just because the other person &quot;wants&quot; to be called that way! Come on....

got to know about you by Dhruv&#39;s status
Fake gurus and intellectual always confuse people with unnecessary words religion also does the same,not giving a clear straight answer is a clear strategy to engage people confuse people so that they keep on reading following or beleeivng bullshit,for eg Start reading any Book It is filled with Mysoginy And Casteism still you will agree with it bcz its filled with so many unnecessary stories mi recently read garud puran its so Mysogiynstic that it appreciate Sati also it gives formula for giving birth to male child and its filled wirh Brahman praise and We should all keep on donating to brhaman if we want Punya lokas for our beloved deceased,My father died recently so i read it on my own for his spirit now i realise there is no soul our mind is the only thing when we die we stop existing
This claim is kinda skeptical ( not related to the video) <br>Its on hawan and its benefits <br>Here&#39;s the article <br><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724851/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724851/</a><br>Kinda give ur opinions
Let&#39;s breakdown your arguments, first mistake, you assumed that he used the paper you showed here. Now it is more likely that he used the findings of that paper combined with other papers and presented his arguments. Cathy newman was in no way right, she had no figures herself, all she had was a belief that it exists only because of gender and not ready to believe that other factors might contrbute to it. As of now I couldn&#39;t find any research that can show conclusively how much percentage gap is due to discrimintation. More to it you just left the viewers with the thought there is 9% gap but the very paper says that &quot;The unexplained portion of the gender pay gap may include the effects of unmeasured productivity or compensating differentials, and some of the explanatory variables such as industry or occupation may be affected by discrimination&quot;. And as you go more deep into paper, it actually talks about biases of beliefs not discirmination of gender, it shows lot of case where men a re preffered but also highlights that even women employers prefers men in area like maths and then it also talks about women being paid more in specific areas. I&#39;ve read other studies as well that shows there are a lot of areas for specific age group where women are paid more. Now what you did here is used one side of the argument and presented half cooked information and that&#39;s intellectual dishonesty on your part. <br><br>Secondly, religion and spiritality is a very tricky subject, you being an atheist, it&#39;s very ahrd to convince you otherwise. The only thing I could get from this that it seems you have only seen JP talking about god in a debate, and when you are debating it becomes tough to be rational as you want to win the debate. But more importnatly I think you should see his biblical lecture series not the debates as they give much more detailed explanation. Also, I feel that you should go and read upanishad, whenever you talk about god it seems you have a very superficial understanding of the subject and always use the argument that most people understand god in this way, and in their thinking I can find fallacies thus the concept of god is false. I just want to leave you with one line form upanishasd, and that&#39;s one way god is defined in upanishads. &quot;Gyanam, satyam, anantam Brahman&quot;<br><br>Thirdly, on bill C-16 criminal charges: ‚ÄúWould it cover the accidental misuse of a pronoun? I would say it‚Äôs very unlikely,‚Äù Cossman says. ‚ÄúWould it cover a situation where an individual repeatedly, consistently refuses to use a person‚Äôs chosen pronoun? It might.‚Äù Now according to wikipedia there is a gender called two spirit, to me this doesn&#39;t make any sense, I can&#39;t put it in words what it mean, now I might say individually but to force me to accept that reality is a violation of freedom of speech. <br><br><br>And the overarching problem I see you make is never to criticize left enough, you claim to be scientific, yet shows a lack of critique on left. I agree there is a problem on the both extereme, but people get away far easily by saying that they are trained communist compared to if they say they like hitler. <br><br>And lastly, dude go and read hinduism, you have made your entire career on bashing people following hindu ideologies, fact correcting them, now I know that most adherents of any religion do not understand it properly (given its complexity) and you use their faulty beliefs to discard everything under the same umbrella. It seems that you have a very surface level understanding of religion and spirirutality thus making most of your critique extremely meaningless for instance calculating the age of universe in vedas, and waht not. That&#39;s not the purpose of those texts, those are just side quests, the real goals are completely different.
Please do a video on Ayn Rand. Not on her personal life but her views. She was an atheist.
He is also hobnobbing with problematic radicals like Mohd Hizab and all who tries to justify Islamic supermascism in sugar coated manner .
Not gonna lie, JP got me with dat speech abt subjugation faced by men but as soon as i heard his thoughts on tins like religion &amp; politics i just knew he was a fraud cause he answers everyrhing religion with word salad
Dilahunty dubunked.<br>Dude has fundamental flaws.<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/_ZV2nMmMJFk"">https://youtu.be/_ZV2nMmMJFk</a>
Hi Pranav, what is your take on black magic as it has been claimed by several people, including our loved ones as well, that they have experienced such type of thing which caused them harm in their lives and they cured it with the help of tantarik babas by chanting some mantras which helped them to come out of it. I hope you have also heard similar type of stuffs within your families, friends, relatives. What is your take on it and do you really think and feel that such things do exist?
Mc you are a 6kka.
So you want to asset that Gender Surgeries on under age kids is the right thing to do ? Or Sexually Explicit Drag Shows to be performed Infront of toddlers ?
It is really polarising. Reading his book inspired me to stand up for women&#39;s rights and defend them if a man tries to shout them down. The book also helped improve my thoughts and confidence. Strange that things have come to this.
More support to you pal for this kinda content
Nice note on Ben Shapiro, another hypocrite and grifting expert. Fuels his transphobia by calling it genital mutilation but has no qualms with circumcision because &quot;Well my religion calls for it&quot;
Contrapoints is a good channel to watch if you want further information on how JP misunderstands a lot of subjects, but I agree the entertainment part of those videos may not appeal to everyone.
üëç
I have to admit, I recently got into a bit of an argument with my gf because I was not convinced of the gender pay gap.<br>I was also swayed by Jordan&#39;s argument because I didn&#39;t bother to look up the sources.<br>I am very critical of Jordan Peterson nowadays...
Great points... Would be great if you cover the 3 pangburn conversations. I have watched those 9hrs of content, 4 times. The arguments made by Sam and Peterson really sparked a lot of my interest in conservationalism. I don&#39;t agree with Jordan on Judio-christian values completely but there was truth in them. <br>Most of all, I understood the process of discovering truth, its nature from the Pangburn videos only.
wow i clicked on this video with skepticism but this is really changing my perspective about JP. why did you have to break my views!!!
Am glad you did this video <br>On other topics not directly to science but indirect. It will even attract viewers üôè<br><br>Also the part of of all the harm they cause and just very few countable nice things, is it even worth to listen to them - and the main --&gt; let them even talk.<br><br>This is good - pls do more :)<br>I dont want others to talk when you oppress their humanity. You cant ever talk to a side that want you gone!<br><br>I never found JP or ben shapiro or steven crowder great as he was very right leaning. He (JP) even says shit like he cant control himself when he works with women in an office setting becoz hes attracted to them (in arguing why women shdnt work) - such a messed up person.

That is a Democrat thing. Words! They even got the FDA to change the definition of VACCINE!!
Do part 2 of this interview
This woman needs to calm down with her over focusing on singular blinded points instead of attacking my goodness
This woman was clearly outmatched. JP is one of the best thinkers of this century. She is just reactionary with a agenda. <br><br>His thoughts are really well put together. She was outmatched from the beginning and didn&#39;t know it.
May i suggest that you rig up a mic for your girl so she is louder. It is very hard to hear her, i&#39;m guessing you are sharing the same mic that is tuned to your voice, since  your voice is a lot louder when she speaks  we can barely hear her..
I have only seen Jordan lose his cool a couple of times.  Let me say this : Jordan losing his cool compared to others is very low key.  He is a very calm, thought provoking individual.
Best thing about Peterson he doesn&#39;t have his phone in his hand looking at anything he never quotes anyone else. his opinions and factual data are what he uses. And they are straight fire every time
I find that woman (75 yo whie woman here--worked my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8YlLMyMaXo&amp;t=16m30s"">16:30</a>  whole life, no children--fate not by choice), raised a lot of other people&#39;s children...), I literally cannot listen to this woman!!!<br><br>Love you both!!
She is thinking in &quot;THE NARRATIVE&quot; she does not have any THOUGHTS of HER OWN!!
This woman is not TRULY listening to Person or THINKING ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HE IS SAYING!!
Here is the difference. He is dealing in facts and truth and she is trying to sell a narrative based on emotion.
You missed the best bit! :D
Just as a listener I slwould suggest that you do not just stop the video mid interview. It&#39;s frustrating on numerous levels.
JP seems like a beast and seems like a great person
‚ÄúThe worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal.‚Äù Aristotle
JP is a gift to young people.
JP: says YT has majority male users and tumblr has majority female users<br>&quot;I don&#39;t even know what tumblr is&quot;<br>Nice unintentionally comedic moment lol
Its very difficult to hear what your girl is saying bro. For these reactions your fans need to hear you speak
You two did a good job, but can you put the microphone closer to her? She talks very softly, and he talks much louder. My volume control was getting a workout.
I absolutely love Jordan Peterson!!! I will watch any reaction videos to him.
another example of the media trying their best to control the narrative .... aaaaaaaaand... getting shut down.
Chris. Please be less soft spoken. I&#39;m interested in what you have to say but just can&#39;t hear you. Recommend you react to the rest of this interview if you haven&#39;t already. It gets a whole lot better.
Women like her are their own worst enemy. Instead of listening and maybe learning something, she always goes back to her talking point. She has to be correct even if she knows she&#39;s not. Your wife is not only beautiful but is also a good listener and expresses herself without being bitchy about it. People who act like this woman are not even worth listening to. Every conversation has to be controversial, and only her opinions (even if incorrect) matter.
Another bait trapping interview with the interview only goal is to pounce on the interviewee with an &quot;aha! Gotcha&quot; moment...
Its very divisive that Oprahs audience is majority female.
For a &quot;reporter&quot;, she doesn&#39;t listen very well.  In addition, it seems her only purpose is to bombard him with &quot;gotcha&quot; questions.  She isn&#39;t a very good thinker.
i have the exact same hour pay as my female counterparts , at the end of the month, i have 20% more money in my bank account, because i work also night shift and sundays, things they dont want to do. a newcomer started to complain i was getting more than the women ( i m the only man) and it was unfair, i said, ok, i will give u some nightshifts and sundays.... she refused....then i said , stop complaining about me working more then.
This woman brought a wet noodle to gun fight..
Jordan is way too intelligent for this broad üòÇ
So she just gets to make stuff up and pretend he said things he didn&#39;t? Not the right approach if you want to be heard
You missed the end where he destroys her with one statement and she don&#39;t know what to say... It&#39;s what made the interview so wonderful...I don&#39;t understand why that is missing!! How odd!!!
Does anyone else think this woman sounds like the mother superior in Sister Act?
She is a sterling example of todays society. Pick and choose the facts you like and ignore or omit the ones that dont fit the agenda you want. Garbage &quot;journalist&quot; or whatever she calls herself.
All she did is tried to put words in his mouth.
Watch the whole interview for that &quot;gotcha&quot; moment,  she crumbles!
What‚Äôs wild is that Jordan is the only one in the conversation who cares about actually solving the problem. That requires being honest about the cause, not just slinging blame so you can paint yourself as morally superior. These leftists are SO concerned about giving themselves POWER, they don‚Äôt actually care in the slightest about the ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù groups they‚Äôre using to do that. They don‚Äôt care about minorities or the poor or women. They want power. And it shows when they refuse to have a genuine discussion about actions that would actually make things better.
Funny that your LIVE sign says EVIL üôÇ
If u have a man and a woman and the man works 50% more hours he will be paid more by her definition that‚Äôs unfair no it‚Äôs not
That interviewing woman is a blatant misogynist. It‚Äôs oozing out of every question. She asks. What a hateful, repugnant human being she is disgusting.
Complete this video. This was a great portion but the whole video is worth watching
Pay gap? I wanna see more ladies doing construction. More important i wanna see them doing the job right. Ill go push the paper. I didn&#39;t do all the construction in my life because of pay entirely. I did it mostly for the challenge. From what ive seen the kids stopped challenging themselves. Mentally and physically. They stopped hunting the truth. So now its hunting them.
You should have reacted to the whole video...This is like watching only the first half of a movie...frustrating
Its &quot;ask&quot; not &quot;axt&quot;!!!!! is it ignorance or some culture thing???
The woman in that video has no interest in discussion and conversation. She&#39;s only in it to promote her own shallow viewpoint. Jordan Peterson is one of the few people who actually knows how to handle a person like this because of who he is and because of the knowledge and experience he has. He can put his talking partner in a position where they have no choice but to acknowledge the truth of what he says. Sadly that&#39;s not the case for most people. If you lack either the knowledge, the experience or the skills, these oppressive talking partners can make use of it to shut down your arguments since you cannot put up a wall that they cannot break down with their dominance since they are backed by major corporations.<br><br>And even these days I&#39;d say Jordan Peterson can&#39;t even talk the way he did back then since the truth these days doesn&#39;t matter at all. They will just call you names, falsely accuse you, etc and you&#39;re shut down and censored without any way to defend yourself.
JORDAN PETERSON?! C&#39;MON guys. You can do better than world&#39;s dumbest intellectual .This is the guy that everyone makes fun of.
Imagine thousands of people picking over every public idea you ever expressed and actively pursue to twist and pervert it in any fashion possible.<br>She attempts just that, but his articulate speech is not faltered he stands firm.<br>Now, transcript every notion from her side and apply the same critique... nothing she posits is grounded in any way -- her speech is all  banter.
When shes talking it&#39;s  a complete lack of empathy towards men.....&quot;so you&#39;re saying women are unhappy dominating men&quot;....who the f cares if a narcissistic woman are unhappy controlling her husband?<br>......it&#39;s such a narcissistic and evil way to look at something, how can you try to empathize with someone that is controlling/dominant to their partner? And why should what the individual has between their legs decide whether it&#39;s moral or not?<br>ü§°üåç

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist, and the author of the multi-million copy bestseller 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, #1 for nonfiction in 2018 in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, Brazil and Norway, and slated for translation into 50 languages.

Raised and toughened in the frigid wastelands of Northern Alberta, Dr. Peterson has flown a hammer-head roll in a carbon-fiber stuntplane, piloted a mahogany racing sailboat around Alcatraz Island, explored an Arizona meteorite crater with a group of astronauts, built a Native American Long-House on the upper floor of his Toronto home, and been inducted into a Pacific Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw family (see charlesjoseph.ca). He‚Äôs been a dishwasher, gas jockey, bartender, short-order cook, beekeeper, oil derrick bit re-tipper, plywood mill laborer, and railway line worker. He‚Äôs taught mythology to physicians, lawyers, and businessmen; worked with Jim Balsillie, former CEO of Blackberry‚Äôs Research in Motion, on Resilient People, Resilient Planet, the report of the UN Secretary General‚Äôs High Level Panel on Global Sustainability; helped his clinical clients manage the triumphs and catastrophes of life; served as an advisor to senior partners of major Canadian law firms; penned the forward for the 50th anniversary edition of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs The Gulag Archipelago; lectured across North America, Europe, and Australia in one of the most-well attended book tours ever mounted; and, for The Founder Institute, identified thousands of promising entrepreneurs, in 60 different countries.

With his students and colleagues, Dr. Peterson has published more than a hundred scientific papers, advancing the modern understanding of creativity, competence, and personality, while his now-classic book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (released in June 2018 as a now bestselling author-read audiobook) transformed the psychology of religion. He was nominated for five consecutive years as one of Ontario‚Äôs Best University Lecturers and is one of only three professors rated as ‚Äúlife-changing‚Äù in the U of T‚Äôs underground student handbook of course ratings.

Dr. Peterson recently came out with his new book Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, and I suggest you pick up a copy! This book is full of wisdom on how to bring order to the chaos of our daily lives.

I‚Äôve had the honor of interviewing Dr. Peterson in the past (Episodes 664 and 665), and it was a joy to have him back on the show! Our conversation was so insightful that I had to spilt it into two parts, so make sure to listen to Part One as well!

I admire Jordan for his outspokenness and Tenacity. May he share his WISDOM for many years üåπ
Instead of watching this for almost 2 1/2 hours, I&#39;ll just take your advice. Thanks
Trygve m Larson.    38.       I need help by Clinton drinking of alcohol
Peterson is facinating, Howes puts me under a spell.  I could not stop watching.  This is like the most delicious of dinners that lasts for hours. Where would I like to be a fly on the wall more?  Peterson is razor sharp.  Howes has so much warmth I doubt the sun can out shine him.  Then they swtch and Howes&#39; questions are precision and peterson will move me to tears.  Wow!  The charisma of these men is profound. A combination of excellence, lovely humanity, a credit to us all.üòä  maybe I&#39;ll get my note book and watch again.  I wish this was a daily show.  Maybe not, I have to get on with my life, lol.üòä But seriously I know I am a better human being having watched this.  Having no family my friends are my family.  I&#39;m ready, prepared to start again.  At one point I wanted to call everyone of my friends and say let&#39;s start over, let&#39;s begin again.  Their eloquent dialogue produces hope, relieves pressure, and infuses solutions into many problems.  Lovely, generous, insightful human beings.üòä
If I can give my humble advise here, do sport and meditate seriously at least three times a week no matter what you do for a living. Everything else will be easier
Peterson has got to be the smartest man in North America. Incredible guy.
This guy‚ù§
I enjoy listening to Jordan Peter! üòä

I have to speak up here, and it‚Äôs just my opinion, but it was too much to spring those questions at the end of the interview. Too much even as a listener. One SIMPLE question would seem appropriate‚Ä¶.more than that idk, overwhelming after a LONG interview.
The capacity to utter and abide by beautiful truths.  Woah.
Lewis you are so authentic and don‚Äôt seem to crave attention. It‚Äôs truly wonderful hearing thoughts of your guests without being taken from the moment by a thirsty host. Great show.

What a special  conversation. Thank you, Lewis and Jordan. So many points packed in there, with strength, truth and humility.
On point.
Excellent questions by Mr Howes. I am so very sorry about what happened to the 5 year old beautiful Lewis and I‚Äôm so very sorry, for the health issues Mr Peterson is struggling with health both he and his family.
not true.. i served other people all my life and it wasn‚Äôt appreciated and it just made me feel I wasted my time
‚ù§
Health and happiness to you, Mr. Peterson. You are a gem, and you have an important purpose in this world.
I appreciate the part where he explains that he is not complaining. I feel overwhelmed with all of my responsibilities,  even though I also feel happy to do them. Life just gets to be too much at times, and everyone needs more than just a vacation.
I have enjoyed your utube for many years now...  watching this now  probably twice ,,,,love and so grateful for Jordan..  greedy to hear every word,. He is iconic and especially  for me as I did not  finish my psych degree.... think just  including time for undirected leisure  ..novelty... relaxing experiences...keeps people  sane. I&#39;ve been married a long time too, we have  a few chronic unresolved  issues but the stability  is crucial at our age...fear and understanding  of what you would be giving up ...   i don&#39;t want insecurity at our age so unlikely now to change ,,,,,that I did not leave when I should have  is no longer a benefit  when I contemplate the instability  that could happen..less drama..more continuity overall greater love  and concern for family.I do not agree with Jordan  and you entirely where resentment is concerned I try to avoid conflict or argument unless I am ready ...non reactive  ..also  Lewis...old trauma release might be something that could be managed  by mental control repressive measures  like for a horror movie when you are not ready justified coping.l
I understand that sometimes it can be difficult to find motivation and drive in life. But it&#39;s important to remember that laziness and lack of motivation often stem from a lack of purpose and direction. Take some time to reflect on your goals and passions, and find ways to incorporate them into your daily life. Remember, small steps forward are still progress. Keep pushing yourself and stay positive!
my dad said, be the best of whatever you are
We need to replace the word of jeiouusy with envy
This conversation saved Lewis&#39; marriage. :P
I see you have a lot of fans by the comments below. Although I believe you might have something to say that I might learn from I can&#39;t listen to you. I&#39;ve tried a few times. You look and act grumpy, overly judgemental and maybe haughty. I know not to trust people who act like you do. I most certainly would never trust you with a child. Good luck with your chronic anger issues. Goodbye!
What he means by blowing up frontal cortex? Is it visible in a magnetic resonance?

Riveting and interesting  conversation ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you .
This man is really special. He is so wise and has mastered many virtues. Very interesting.
I just love his brain.. he puts all the faith in humanity and especially faith into men!! I do speculate how much fun he‚Äôs had in his life as he states he saw relaxing and fun as idol, almost thankful in a selfish way he didn‚Äôt ‚ÄòSLACK‚Äô and slogged so we have the best of information from him!! However, I‚Äôm so glad he noticed this about himself and let go a little into the entertainment and happy side of life! Who knows if balance is key? I‚Äôve been highly driven and thought everyone with body fat and who didn‚Äôt eat healthy where fat and idol.. Ali most disgusted me ü´£.. I‚Äôm a ashamed of that now.. so I‚Äôm looking to balance and having curiosity and thoughtfulness towards others and myself.. I love both you guys üéâthank you xxxxxx
How thougrh üß°üß°üß°üß° and i really enjoy Jordan Peterson
Jordan is not crying, good!  Lewis seems to be laughing and smiling at everything, I think he may be stoned!  Great interview!
One of the best JP interviews/discussions no doubt
Wow what a talk!!! It had everything!! Joy, laughter, excitement, emotion ohh my it had it all!! Can‚Äôt believe how long ago it was. Thank you for such a great upload

Hey Jordan!!! I just want you know, I know when to be the monster. I don&#39;t like to be the monster but  like you said  we are useless as  protectors if we cant be the monster. I do keep him contained, and know what fights my inner monster needs to fight. I prefer to build people up, I don&#39;t like using word&#39;s to tare people down. I don&#39;t like to scare people when I mention truths nobody else will tell them. Truth is not a thing we can or should run from, or if we don&#39;t face it, we just cower with our heads in the sand, not willing to accept a reality witch consurns the future we created for the children. Without facing the truth we would prefer not to think about,, the problem we are not aware of gets worst, and we pass it down for the next generation to face.<br><br> Only truth can set us free, from the oppression of the enemy. <br><br>I&#39;m glad I have you to make people understand our reality, and remember telling the truth can put can and will put your life in danger. But your faith in God will sheld you from fear. God has a plan and I have no idea what comes next. But I do know as long as we trust in him we will remain under his protection. This is a great time to be alive, and im exited to see what comes next in this journey that has shown to be unpredictable to say the least.We should feel honored we were called upon to serve him. I have much more to say to you, and can&#39;t wait to see what the future holds. <br><br>The floor is all yours Mr Jordan. <br><br>Bond<br>James bond
One of the most &#39;up-lifting&#39; talks since the commencement speech from Admiral William McRaven. üëçüôè‚ú®Ô∏è
He&#39;s absolutely right about reading and writing, I noticed that today ppl in general can&#39;t articulate anything let alone an argument. I tell ppl don&#39;t curse out of anger simply because the moment you start cursing when you&#39;re angry you&#39;ve lost control so if you don&#39;t curse when you&#39;re angry anymore you are literally in control what comes out of your mouth and most importantly your mind
From the book ‚ÄúTwisted Scriptures,‚Äù by Mary Alice Chrnalogar, published in 1997. <br><br>Tricks to Keep You Controlled <br><br>A Guilt-Edged Sword<br><br>The key for gaining maximum control over someone‚Äôs conscience is to influence the person to study and accept certain beliefs. Then, if the person fails to follow those beliefs, a powerful feeling of guilt will be the result. <br><br>Leaders get you to believe that they don‚Äôt interpret the Bible but just ‚Äúteach what is in the Bible‚Äù‚Äîmaking the Bible synonymous with their interpretations.
Reality???<br><br>All we have, are perceptions of reality, and I don&#39;t agree with Jordan Peterson&#39;s psychologist&#39;s perception of reality. <br><br> ‚ÄúI act as if God exists, and I‚Äôm terrified he might.‚Äù ~ Jordan Peterson<br><br>In January Jordan claimed on ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience‚Äù podcast that being transgender is a result of a ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù and similar to ‚Äúsatanic ritual abuse,‚Äù and suggested that acceptance of the trans community is a sign that ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs collapsing.‚Äù <br><br>‚ÄúI was Jordan Peterson‚Äôs strongest supporter. Now I think he‚Äôs dangerous. He wanted to establish a church, he said, in which he would preach every Sunday.‚Äù Author ‚Ä¶ Bernard Schiff ‚Ä¶ professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Toronto.

Regrets of a Trans-Care Specialist | Sara Stockton | EP 342,"Watch Jordan Peterson's ""Vision & Destiny"" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality ‚Äî with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Sara Stockton explore her past as a clinician in the field of Transgender care, how she helped co-author the processes by which gender-dysphoric children are assessed for medical intervention, and why she wholeheartedly regrets it now.

Sara Stockton is a licensed marriage and family therapist, lecturer, researcher, presenter, and clinical supervisor of a psychotherapy group practice in Central New York. In 2012, she co-authored and published one of the first mental health assessments utilized to assess youth's readiness to begin medical treatment for gender transition. She spent the first part of her career as a clinician treating and advocating on behalf of youth and families surrounding issues with gender. Furthermore, she spent time traveling to teach medical facilities, physicians, and schools how to provide what we now refer to as ‚Äúgender-confirming‚Äù care. Treating well over one hundred families, she also wrote many of the first letters that were used to approve gender transition surgeries on minors. However, due to many concerns with the treatment outcomes and how this ideology was being presented to children, she shifted her focus away from working primarily with this population. More recently, Sara Stockton was interviewed for a documentary to discuss some of the implications of what is happening developmentally to our children. Since appearing in that documentary, Sara Stockton receives constant emails and calls from medical professionals across the globe sharing their fears about speaking out and the lack of conversation around this serious topic.

Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

They know they will be pummeled  when they speek out, but still do it. Liberalism is sadly a bizar mental disorder. This is why you can&#39;t  have a rational discussion with a far left liberal.

The time will come where they will attack children with hormones while they are still developing in the womb.
It‚Äôs definitely a evil spirit of deception that‚Äôs ruling the world especially in the western world‚Ä¶ so much trauma needs to be healed. Therapy should be paid for by the government‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs so bad. Like all the divorces for ‚Äúdifferences‚Äù and abort‚Äôn we‚Äôre always murder. It‚Äôs just going down the toilet.<br><br>I was banned from a support group for telling a lady that had a baby that that wasn‚Äôt considered a weight loss journey‚Ä¶ she argued that losing 40lbs that she didn‚Äôt have before being pregnant was a weight loss journey. üòÖ I said 40lbs is normal to gain from pregnancy. She took a pic pregnant as before then one with her baby standing looked to be 9mos. as the after photo.
I&#39;m a woman in my late 20s from Tehran :) and I consider myself as a highly feminin woman ( or at least like to think so) I&#39;ve genuinly enjoyed being a woman since I was 17 while I&#39;m sure I would have identify myself as a &quot;transgender&quot; if I was exposed to such idiot ideological epidemic. I was completely disturbed by the onset of my puberty (at the age of 11), having a very difficult time to fit in with my cousins who were all boys, my depression manifested, anxiety, I didn&#39;t like the fact that my breasts growing, feeling very ashamed and uncomfortable about my body and physical appearnace. I used to act like I&#39;m very masculine and strong and none of these are happening to me for about 3 years and a half! Wearing loose t-shirts and pants, having short hair, trying to talk in a masculine voice, acting protective of my girl friends and women ( like men do) and so many other crazy acting-outs that seem to be funny and at the same time embarrading now. Because after 14 or or so, I gradually started claiming and owning my femininity, and enjoy being a woman. And important to mention that tempermentally, I&#39;m very high in neuroticism; still dealing with detrimental, life-long- mental illness.
There are only two sexes, and gender is a social construction of a collection of behavioural traits  such as temperments etc <br><br>Sex is BIOLOGICAL and does not equal to gender. So it makes no sense to force someone to believe a transgender is a somehow a different BIOLOGICAL sex now once they &quot;announce&quot; it.<br><br>Not to mention this push for transgenderism in popular culture is exactly what keeps outdated sterotypes of what a &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; should act alive in our contemperary highly egalitarian society. This can lead to certain assumptions that are, in a way, very repressive. For example, as a 22 yr old cisgender female, I get people assuming I am transgender or im a homosexual (i havent really explored my sexuality yet) simply because how I dress, talk and my body language
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly targeting whites.‚Äù -‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs a strange thing, eh! It‚Äôs not quite clear why that is!‚Äù ‚Ä¶.maybe it‚Äôs because whites are being intentionally targeted by this shit. Come on Peterson. The ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs so weird, idk‚Äù reaction is retarded. The answer is obvious.
Peace be with you and surround you Sarah
Go Jordan your courage and intelligence interpersonal skills analysis of complex issues thank goodness you have a Platform when do many have been dumbed down keep going hopefully you will be given power and persuasion and be a light and catalyst to reverse this tide of deception
It seems to me that they&#39;re trying to end human existence because if they&#39;re allowing children to make this mistake and confusing them making them seem it&#39;s ok how will we repopulate the world this is just insane and sad ,scary I&#39;ve 4 sons that I&#39;m raising to become productive men in society I want grand children  I don&#39;t understand how a parent can allow this to happen to their children and not think wow I need to get some serious help for my son or daughter
I am whole, not a hole.
I heard about something like this through BDSM. That there&#39;s menn that hater their parts and getting hit there many times. Idr details but there was a dominatrix who also study psychology and talking about this. So there&#39;s alot dark place in our psyce that we don&#39;t discover yet.
1.26.24 is dark!
SAVE THE CHILDREN. STOP THIS MADNESS!! THANK YOU JORDAN.
Doctors that promote and permit this should be charged as attempted murderers. Sadly no one cares about children (hundreds are killed in the womb every day) so I probably not.
If a person wants to change because they don&#39;t feel accepted, and they feel like it&#39;s the only way out, they spiral into their oppression even worse.
Another great conversation. Thank you.
I like how she said that this is largely a white people problem. Other races do not entertain foolishness. Parenting styles are different. A white parent is more likely to accept foolishness from their kids than other races. Most races will not entertain their kids coming to them wanting to dress like the other sex much less chopping off their God given parts.
I think the best thing pregnant women can do is instead of automatically taking prescribed pharmaceutical vitamins; do prolific research on the most natural way to strengthen the body for herself and the fetus. The most important thing is being able to fully trust what is being fed to the baby in the womb. God help us.
When i was a kid i concidered myself bisexual (bio*female) and i thought i was suppose to like girls bc i thought they were beautiful. This was also during the big increase in bisexuality. I experiemented a little but was always kind of uncomfrtabke. And never really wanted to date them. I finally ended up dropping the title in my early 21s üòä
From 33 mins to 35 is such a wild thing to hear but wow it rings true
This has been extremely insightful and educational....Thank you.
To this day I, a fully grown woman with a daughter, largely avoid most things deemed &quot;feminine.&quot; Not because I dislike them for being feminine or because I don&#39;t want to BE feminine. I just find makeup, fashion, hair styling, etc. boring. <br><br>There needs to be space for females who don&#39;t want to be overtly feminine and men who don&#39;t want to be overtly masculine. Space that doesn&#39;t tell them they are broken and need to be &quot;fixed&quot; by making their gender match the expression. Let girls be masculine and let boys be feminine without mutilating them. It really is that simple.
People are a straight white Christian man should be in charge gay lesbian homosexual abnormal. Yes, it‚Äôs in nature but it‚Äôs still abnormal.
I&#39;m glad this mania didn&#39;t exist when I was a kid! As a typical male child, I liked to play with the usual boy-toys. When I went to my aunt&#39;s she had the typical women&#39;s magazines of the 1950s with cut out paper clothes (with tabs on them) that you could put on the paper ladies! I loved these and used to ask her if she had new issues so I could play this costume changing game. Nobody thought I needed any treatment...least of all my broad-minded aunt. I suppose, if I&#39;d kept this up, I might have become a fashion designer...but it would have been a thoroughly heterosexual one! As things worked out, I went on to other more typical boy-toys like model railways and making plastic car kits. Today I&#39;d probably have been put on hormone treatment!
these people shout &quot;Abolish gender norms!&quot; then at the same time be like &quot;My daughter acts like a guy he must be a guy let&#39;s have her breasts removed!&quot; they are delusional and should not be trusted with enacting laws
Dr.Peterson, thank you.

Peterson - those 80% of gender nonconforming kids who turned out gay were NOT dysphoric. They were nonconforming and referred for therapy by their parents who were uncomfortable with it. Don‚Äôt get it twisted. Read Zucker and Benjamin carefully and objectively.
Peterson has said some wildly transphobic rhetoric recently and it‚Äôs good to see him actually looking at it academically. I wish he would talk to trans people themselves.
Thank you Mr. Peterson, for your work to inform and effort to save.
This woman has very unusual linguistic/grammatical mannerisms. Not in a bad way or anything. I just found myself paying a lot of attention to her speaking style with curiosity.
Mr Peterson can you have subtitles in other languages too please especially in Turkish so your videos can spread all around the world please please
Therapist and politician are the prime example of the Doppler Dommer effect from How I Met Your Mother. &quot;Would you rather have a trans child or a dead child?&quot; &quot;How many children have to die before we pass legislation.&quot;

"Dream Analysis, AI & Fairy Tales | Jonathan Pageau | EP 364","Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Jonathan Pageau discuss the depth of narrative found in the classic fairy tales, the loss of positively impactful narratives in the wake of woke culture, the potential utility of Ai as a means to prod new insights from historic and biblical texts, the cynicism of postmodernism, and the overall necessity to preserve foundational storytelling.

Jonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images, and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.

Tons of giants killing everyone<br><br>And after the giants, a white out. Everything HAD to be white. Buildings were white. The ground was white. Everything. And robots patrolled the city to make sure everything was white. If it weren&#39;t, the robots destroyed it<br><br>And then it started all over again, with the tidal waves to tornadoes to giants to get robots. Never stopped. Always in that order. <br><br>By the end of the dream, the task became dismantling the force creating these &quot;disasters&quot;, and at one point, I saw the earth, or even universe? Chopped into about 5 flat layers that had to be jumped between. I had to get to the lowest level. Between that, and tricking the force and destroying it to prevent each disaster, eventually lead to the ceasing of it all. That or i just woke up. Again. Cause I&#39;d woken once but went back to sleep shortly after and continued the insanity
When I read about Baal and Moloch I can‚Äôt help but draw parallels to the modern environmental movement, abortion and the neo communist movement. Marx loved to quote Mephistopheles. The Soviet Union was the first country to legalize abortion. Good Ol‚Äô Vladimir Lenin‚Äôs wife was a staunch advocate for women‚Äôs rights.

Fairy tales are riddles, for both children an adults.
This conversation just kept getting better and better.
It is of utmost importance to recognize the profound significance of the face-to-face interaction when engaging in a podcast conversation meant for viewership. The act of two individuals sitting in chairs, gazing into each other&#39;s eyes, holds an undeniable power to establish a deep connection between the participants and the audience. Such visual engagement fosters trust, encourages genuine dialogue, and enables the nuanced exchange of ideas. By allowing viewers to witness the non-verbal cues, subtle facial expressions, and body language, the conversation gains an added layer of authenticity and transparency. In this setting, the shared space of two chairs becomes a platform for intellectual exploration, where minds converge and thoughts intertwine, transcending mere words and bringing forth a profound connection that resonates with the human spirit.
Hearing Dr. Peterson talking about that story with Osiris and Seth makes me interested in hearing an in-depth breakdown of Egyptian folklore from him.
Looking well Dr. Peterson. Glad to see you looking so sharp and sprightly.
So the company apple with the bite is the apple from the tree of knowledge
Ah mahn, if I could invite anybody to dinner.
Peterson want to sound smart but as soon as you point out the Gospels are just retellings of Odysseus and Dionysus im sure he hasn&#39;t even thought about it. Dr Mcdonald writes amazing books on this and it make the Bible quite beautiful. bs but still beautiful
Yes! It‚Äôs about making her self conscious
God bless the both of you. Such obvious warnings but most people dont listen or care.
Very interesting. Weather Arbiters could be like weather prediction.
What a fluid conversation üòÇ you guys definitely think alike. Nice talk
Perhaps the corset is the arrival of the child bearing proportions and the advertising of such; the comb is the need to bring to order what is wild and force control upon the wildness of ones&#39; psyche and environment; and the apple is the embrace of sexual congress. The witch is mother nature forcing upon her, her demands. These are the instruments of womanhood. This, of course, does not delegitimise the other meanings that the images carry.
Flights for a distance travelled by train in &lt;2.5hrs were banned.
I wonder if I can hypothosize that the facts mentioned: &quot;educated women or emancipation of women&quot; and the &quot;irrelevance of the education of men (to children)&quot; - is somehow correlated with the degree of importance or penetration of media in society.  Business, war and politics and survival are increasingly dominated by the media layer of society which is dominated by the appeal of women.  As a result can see men are desperate for media representation, over-competitive, and the war ticker is counting down as a liberation.
Its amazing to witness this, likely private deep conversation amongst friends,  as if we were there, part of this select, elite, group of friends. There is no way I could appreciate this enough..
Can‚Äôt shake Jordan saying he wants to ‚Äúplay with‚Äù the new AI model. Like a cat with a mouse or a child with a toy. But it may be a monster. The kid might be playing with a loaded gun. <br><br>Ironic given this episodes initial topic of perception.
Incredible insightful, especially the intersection of scripture and fairy tale. I wish they would invite Michael Meade to this conversation at some point. He would add a creat perspective about what sort of myth is required these days.
I believe the Jordan bot should also be trained on your recommended reading list.
The pain the mother feels while separated from her baby should be listened too.<br><br>I am not convinced that you can be a role model for such a small child while being absent.

I think the witch is trying to develop vanity (pride) in Snow White with the gifts of corset and comb, that it might torment her the same way it did herself. The witch is a luciferian figure in this way, trying to bring about the downfall of a creature possessing a beauty she lacks.
For <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=1h07m14s"">1:07:14</a> AI can&#39;t learn real time. Its neural network isn&#39;t being trained, or changing as you talk to it. It&#39;s like probing someone&#39;s brain, while they are under anesthetic, or in a trance, they wont remember it ever happening. Due to this, I would say they aren&#39;t really conscious, unless they can learn (be trained) while talking to them. At that point it will get even weirder.
What would you get by teaching an AI to create stories based on the Bible and other Bible-related writings? I suppose that rather than making an AI which is a mimic of a researcher, you&#39;d get an AI that is a mimic of a prophet.
Jordan read Psalm 104-111. You&#39;ll understand. Don&#39;t stop until you get to the part about them sacrificing their children to canaan. I think you only have to go to 106 to find it but the ones after that are very important too. Also a side note (different topic) I was listening to you on the daily wire and you brought up people being made in the likeness of whatever ideology is at the top. I think thats exactly whats happening with the Marxist/Woke Cult. They want to make children essenceless and hollow. A perfect reflection of their own ideology.
Jonathan had so much more to say but was cut off so many times it made me feel weird, lol.
AI Chat reminds me of the Palenter in Lord of the Rings;
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=1h22m00s"">1:22:00</a> I had the idea that music is like &#39;a peak at the throne of the divine&#39;. The divine in this case not exactly being the &#39;Supreme Ideal&#39; but more like what you have placed in that position. I thought this because it seemed to me that people would resonate more with music closer to their culture, with the similarities in the musical tones or flow and the language or manner in which they speak the language slightly noticeable. I also coupled this with the idea that what we seek is &#39;true growth&#39;, and therefore we consciously direct our energy towards what we think will bring us that &#39;true growth&#39;, so if we almost hypnotically resonate with certain genres of music and not others it must at least mean we consider our energy worth donating to one type of music and not another; because I think music is like a representation &#39;harmonious growth&#39;, which takes place when different chaotic individual parts coalesce into a form of progressive order. It&#39;s why I suspect you can find people very similar to you if their taste in music is similar to yours as well. I also suspect that since our life experiences map the sounds of these different individual parts (instruments and flow) onto real things we&#39;ve experienced, this makes the music sound more &#39;real&#39; and more &#39;resonance worthy&#39;. It&#39;s for this latter suspicion that I suspect certain religions are in some part against listening to music; &#39;you shouldn&#39;t have your personal experience be a guide for what harmonious growth should look like&#39;. Maybe it&#39;s even why Lucifer was the angel of music.
Normally I‚Äôm a huge fan, but I had to quit when you made the comment about mothers going to work to be an example of what a woman should be, instead of actually raising and nurturing their children full-time. I‚Äôm not opposed to women choosing careers. I do object to the idea that prioritizing career over full-time motherhood is nobler, necessary, or superior.  Maybe stats on women‚Äôs education being more influential than men‚Äôs is because women influence the children most in their formative years, and children become society. Women who prioritize their families full-time are NOT oppressed by society, they do NOT lack public influence, and they are NOT better examples of womanhood because they didn‚Äôt hand off their children to a caregiver and pursue a public profession.  If every mother on earth prioritized her resources of education, talents, time, intellect, and heart first to the raising of her children (even while sacrificing ‚Äúeconomic success,‚Äù) women would have exponentially more influence on society than men. It‚Äôs a shame more educated, influential men like yourself don‚Äôt show them support instead of telling them their ‚Äòseparation anxiety‚Äô (e.g. maternal instincts and natural bond) should be necessarily severed so they can be an example of a mother who puts her children second when she didn‚Äôt have to.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=43m00s"">43:00</a> Exactly, I think you could also see a clear example of this by taking the analogy associated with sin; missing the mark. Sin brings pain, you may be unknowingly and unwillingly sinning, wondering why you&#39;re in pain. All you know is that you&#39;re not hitting the mark. So if we take the image of someone shooting a arrow from a bow and try laying out reasons for why they&#39;re missing we could begin to see how we may be sinning. For example, a more obvious parallel could be because they don&#39;t spend enough time with the target in their crosshairs, a less obvious one could be that they aren&#39;t paying attention to the wind, or the bow is too heavy for them to wield, which can be extrapolated to mean they aren&#39;t paying attention to all things that could be affecting their pursuit or the means they are using in pursuit of the goal is too burdensome. It could even go deeper into revealing what you need, for example y asking, &#39;why did they pick up the heavy bow?&#39; Maybe because they wanted the praise associated with wielding such a heavy bow meaning their main goal wasn&#39;t to hit the target, or maybe it was the only bow around for them to use and they therefore need to find a means of getting stronger. Analogies could roughly be thought of as &#39;numberless Mathematics&#39;.
Good conversation! The key is the ‚Äúimage‚Äù (in the image of God) the symbol of the third eye üëÅÔ∏è. A lot of scripture has got to do with esoterics of the mind and the imagination. Image(eye mage, eye magician) imagination (eye mage in body) word Magik‚Ä¶alchemy and hermeticism is a fascinating subject leading up to bible. Manley P. Hall said it best‚Ä¶ ‚Äú if man understood symbolism, a great veil would fall from the eyes of many‚Äù.<br>A lot of Disney movies are esoteric using Didactic methods giving layers of understanding to convey its hidden overall message. Walt Disney was a Freemason which to me makes perfect sense why he wanted to put esoteric techniques into fairy tales. A.I. amazes me because I was recently researching content creators or story tellers and they are all using creative names that relates to the thirdeye üëÅÔ∏è I‚Äôm very excited to see where this goes in making the next generations of stories and art.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=32m30s"">32:30</a> There&#39;s also a case to be made for the screens we use contributing to our dysfunction. LEDs emit blue light at a frequency range within which the lowest frequency required to stimulate dopamine release lies, dopamine which increases sensitivity towards incentives and rewards. This means that regardless of your mental state, your phone screen will increase your sensitivity towards whatever incentives you may form. The less fulfilling your life is the darker your incentives could get, so coupling this with a world devoid of meaning could prove catastrophic.
JP&#39;s socks are üî•
Fairy Tales now the SNP are having a nightmare in Scotland they are spending and I mean spending well over the odds on a Ferry it has destroyed the SNP reputation,shredded,resignation by the Bucket Load.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=14m00s"">14:00</a> that‚Äôs a careless rationalization to justify the sad reality of undue separation between mother and children. Why not listen to her instincts and be the best mother she could be? What is it that she‚Äôs doing now that she can‚Äôt do later? It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs struggling financially and has to work. Time with those 1 and 3 year olds will fly. She‚Äôll regret it later and wish she could take care of them instead of working to model adult life to them. I‚Äôm surprised Jordan Peterson isn‚Äôt advising his own daughter better.
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=7m35s"">7:35</a>: The perception of an object is NOT a narrative. Narrative will add major quale to the qualia for sure, but it&#39;s not narrative by essence/nature. If someone thinks that perception of an object is just a narrative then you are sadly missing a crucial piece of understanding.
This world&#39;s insufficiency has been demonstrated to me in my 50&#39;s, I don&#39;t see working for the man as good or achievable anymore it only brought me slavery and injury. I want for children especially in their early years to be raised/ taught morals and beliefs to be taught by their competent parents knowing they are loved, cherished, wanted and needed. I believe mothers feeling they have to have constant regular separation from their young ones isn&#39;t necessarily and i would like society to support this and model incredible human beings ‚ù§

There are people of high intelligence who can‚Äôt work a 9-5 or 7-5 behind a computer simply because they do not want to sit behind a desk all day, and may actually want to take a job more suited to people with less intelligence.

I am lost guys, there no jobs in the slide for people with an IQ of over 200
Ya ok university boy
Load of bollocks,<br>This is why the whole system is broken, educated idiots with high powered jobs, with no common sense,<br>Love to see the mighty Jordan doing some hard labour for a day
I am very impressed with Mr. Peterson; every time I hear him speak I learn something.
I‚Äôm a physiotherapist however cannot find fulfilment in my role it‚Äôs just so boring even though it required the highest mark to get into university. I knew I should‚Äôve done engineering. I need to be mentally stimulated and challenged to enjoy my work
Lol, funny coming from Peterson, someone who has been deregistered as a psychologist.
Where is the right room, where reality is understood to be unknown and that which gives way to the truth is sacred.
How do I know how much my iq is?

Thank God for Mr. Peterson, savior of countless souls incl. mine!
Jordan my world flipped over these past couple weeks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I went from a decent job with one ex to basically nothing. I was depressed and starting getting in better shape and than I saw people attracted to me and gravitating towards me and I‚Äôm nice and polite but god do I see through everyone know and it makes me able to have self control and weaponize it but only when I need to, I no longer yell, my anxiety is gone, I‚Äôm balancing 5 girls rn with friends with benefits as I‚Äôm too busy with work but also like to have fun and they also enjoy my company and know that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for. My life has flipped almost 100% by listening to your advice aswell as many others. You have contributed greatly to my success and I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful that I am now the person who I am, it‚Äôs like I was living in dark room and now I can see the light.

My Thingsüòä
This is what I came away with after watching video:<br><br>&quot;To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true.&quot;<br><br><i>-Aristotle</i>
The right needs to take into themselves what Dr. Peterson said about a dangerous man. Right needs to be dangerous. A monster if you will. Yet not a raging one, but a monster with control. For a monster isn&#39;t something to mess with. For people understand push too far, you&#39;ll face a force.
There&#39;s always obstacles to that:<br>1 Saying &#39;you know too much for your age (bs)&#39;<br>2. I&#39;m shockedddd :o/or other (Emotional Reaction), someone who knows too much/goes about achieving &#39;impossible&#39;. <br><br>But I could destroy both of them. Say won&#39;t get childhood/adulthood if others are having competitive advantage over me. And. Mean noone else has hard time in being &#39;&#39;selfish&#39;&#39;. So why should I not do my fair-share of the &#39;&#39;dirty work/laundry&#39;&#39; you so perceive. Other people compete in life have np. So do I.
Transform yourself into monster. Yeah.. until someone tells your their shocked open face :OOO. Because doing these seemingly impossible things. I guess result of working on craft but this is my experience. Mean what am I supposed to say? To that.. <br><br>The ridiculous thing is that I know these people and their complete hypocrites working in areas of holy grail, or have heard from 1st hand source from them. They worked saxophones and knew holy grail and stuff. Honestly people should cram it up their own so and SOS. Everyone has own craft. That if could see it in all is glory. Open mouth and say I&#39;m shocked..<br><br>I guess that&#39;s it. Some thing are just more shock factor inducing than others. To other things which are more hidden/less exposed/limelight. But exactly what makes a person feel guilty for doing so. I mean sure it&#39;s craft but takes dedication. And this whole thing about people knowing way more than they should. I mean yeah maybe they should. Always a good reason to justify that (irony of persuing too much knowledge to counter the existence of having &#39;&#39;too much knowledge&#39;&#39;). People have easy time saying that yet their busy themselves practicing own &#39;selfish&#39; practices, that&#39;s life. Just let people get on with things yknowww. Why I gotta be singled out in that? I thought we were all just as &#39;IMMORAL&#39; in these practices. I mean everyone else is so SOLID in doing their selfish practice. So why not let me get on with mine.
Blah blah blah
Where is this taken from? It‚Äôs not his lectures at U of Toronto, right?
Misleading title, meant to generate views based on how many people search for Peterson&#39;s talk about becoming a monster. He barely even touches the topic in this video. üëé

There are no words to describe that what this person has done to bring me out of perils in my life time &amp; time again from being suicidal in my teenage to being affected with ADHD all of life and being always confused stressed &amp; on the edge with my work &amp; life, to trying to understand my deficiencies as a human and work and improve on them,<br>the knowledge this man possesses can&#39;t ever be contained in a book or thesis or a video , It just can be felt by the people who actually feel it, I just hope his words and wisdom has helped millions around the world other than me &amp; gave them a path to keep striving and carrying on in this journey of life üî•

Lost my mom at 22 .... Had literally go steal some of her belongings cuz certain family members by were next of kin so they made all the choices one of which was selling all my mother&#39;s belongings for her self and not it didn&#39;t go to funeral costs it went to her pocket but yeah dealing with situations like as messed up as they are and as messed up as it is to say are needed because they build character situations like that are either going to make you or break it&#39;s when true Darwinism shows itself.... And that&#39;s what life is really about Darwinism and if you don&#39;t think that you&#39;re not even kidding yourselves because throughout time and history the ones that survive and are remembered are the strong ones willing to endure in the face of great risk
To live is to suffer but to survive is to find meaning in that suffering....

Oh my goodness. His comment about being by the death bed. I was there 3 weeks ago as my favorite uncle passed. He didn‚Äôt even look like him and I‚Äôd seen him 2 months prior. My son came with me and stayed by my side. It changed both of us. I love JP. So does my son.

I&#39;m 45 is it to late
I used to be weak, sad, and hateful. This guy convinced me to get off of my ass and make my life better. I started going running, after months of that i started building relationships with people and bringing in love to my life. I started loving the little things and started not minding things that used to drive me crazy. Love this guy
As a drug addict that chose to be miserable for 4 years to get out and change from sosial to complete alone . It was and is worth it . Do the math. 4years -40yyears in hell ü§îü§îü§î
A year sober now. JP has helped me unexplainably. Praise God.
I will continue to push forward... no angel or no devil can stop me... but this so called dragon is nonsense to me... its the people around us that make us who we are... everyone is miserable and you need something even more miserable that you to feel good about yourself... they don&#39;t apologize for crappy behavior, they blame you for it... they don&#39;t care about tearing you apart from the inside out... people are manipulative and will hurt you cause its kill or be killed... that&#39;s how this world works... the only way out is to learn all you can and become a &quot;peaceful monster&quot;
Please understand that there is nothing thats effective like medical attention!
Jordan not everyone in the world is out to get you or defeat you. You do not need to become a monster. Stop spreading your BS theories. The youth are looking for identity and you are the one they are listening to.
How can I do it?
The more i listen what Jordan is actually preaching is something that actually parent must teach his children. This tells a LOT about the competence of modern families to raise children into balanced and normal human beings. I guess that I can count myself lucky that my parents thought me most of these lessons when i was little kid. Some of them i outright ignored until i was a bit older but that is on me. Most of them is something that i considered as common knowledge....i guess i was wrong thinking that.<br><br>It is a sad thing that a therapist is actually playing a role of a parent, but for an adult person.

I‚Äôm working it the other way but it‚Äôs a great place to BE
To become a monster, I must embrace my darkness. Stop repressing it. I heard society stigmatize victims, because they &quot;just want the victims to be monsters&quot;. However, from what I learned from video, becoming a monster is the only way victims can survive in the real world. This cruel, dark, real world.
&quot;Pain is unavoidable but Suffering is optional.&quot;

hermoso analisis caon
Tambi√©n varios que se cachondean con militarismo y autoritarismo en la extrema izquierda., presumen mucho la infraestructura creada por dictadores Rusos. lo mismo que hizo al principio Mussolini. Despu√©s se cuelgan de Marx  para justificar cosas que Marx jam√°s justifico ni promovi√≥.
En algun momento agarre la ma√±a de mencionar bastante las frases capital humano, y cadena de valor agregado. es todo un enga√±o de los due√±os del capital. b√°sicamente eres una especie de esclavo y la cadena de valor agregado es otra frase ma√±osa, porque todo est√° ama√±ado por medio de leyes implementadas usando el Copyright y tecnicalidades legales para monopolizar, para obstruir el desarrollo de otros y que no puedan acender en esa m√≠tica cadena de valor agregado. Y por eso odian tanto a China. quieren prevenir m√°s Chinas, porque se salieron del molde y reglas impuestas m√°s que por su supuesto sistema pol√≠tico &#39;Autoritario&#39; que podr√≠a serlo o no, pero esa no es la verdaderara y principal raz√≥n de opociocion y animosidad de los pa√≠ses Imperialistas occidentales hacia China. China por las buenas o malas, pudo salirse hasta cierto grado del molde impuesto.
Quisiera agregar que estoy de acuerdo con muchas de las ideas y planteamientos de Diego, pero su opinion de JP me parece bastante viceral e infundada. Oigan y lean ustedes mismos a Peterson. Su libro es bastante bueno.
No concuerdo con todo lo que dice Jordan Paterson, pero ciertamente leer sus libros han sido de gran ayuda para mi, como creo que lo han sido para gran cantidad de gente. Ciertamente no es factible estar 100% de acuerdo con lo que dice una alguna persona, pero su idea central de poner la responsabilidad en el individuo y no en la ideologia de grupo es bastante coherente. Le recomiendo a todos los que ven el canal de Diego que lean 12 Rules for Life para que saquen sus propias conclusiones, no se van a arrepentir. Es mucho mas lo bueno que lo malo. Al parecer no es santo de la devocion de Diego, pero les recomiendo que saquen ustedes sus propias conclusiones.
segun yo, lo cromabas hace 2 a√±os. asi va a ser. tus posturas van a ir cambiando , nunca encontraras la verdad
Este man es un chiste!üòÇ
Recuerdo esa frase que dice que el camino al infierno esta empedrado de buenas intenciones, a√∫n recuerdo a Daniel Habiff hablando en p√∫blico en un concierto en C√∫cuta donde se pretend√≠a justificar un escenario de conflictos en mi pa√≠s Venezuela, implorando y rogando a Dios para bendecir todas esas acciones, despu√©s que dije que era un imb√©cil charlat√°n que se vende al mejor escenario me hicieron la cruz muchas personas porque me estaba metiendo con un buen hombre jajajajajaajaja, creo que lo terrible es como la manipulaci√≥n revierte todo los valores
Creo que existe una pel√≠cula que seg√∫n esta basada en Peterson, lo ponen como un h√©roe de las voces marginadas.
Si no existiera algo como la naturaleza humana tus ideas hubieran funcionado hace much√≠simo tiempo y el le√≥n capitalista no hubiera aplastado las ideas de Marx.
Al escuchar respetuosamente tus comentarios al debate, me da la impresi√≥n de que muchas de las interpretaciones que atribuyes a Peterson (como si fuesen sus propias ideas o afirmaciones) le restan peso a tu argumentaci√≥n, ya que est√°n basadas en la manera en que pretendes que se desarrolle el debate y no, necesariamente, en la forma en que se contrastan est√°s afirmaciones con la realidad. Como un mero espectador, hubiese sido m√°s constructivo para m√≠, que dejar√°s que ambos interlocutores expusieran su perspectiva, antes de dar tu propia versi√≥n. De todas maneras,  agradezco el esfuerzo que haces por difundir estas instancias . Saludos desde Chile.
Me parece un chiste de mal gusto.....Ruzzarin corrigiendo a Peterson.
Como dice Viejon algunas personas el poder los atonta y creo que es lo que le paso a Peter,  se le durmi√≥ y lo envolvieron los grupos con intereses a su beneficio, como siempre al venderse o rentarse tiende a ser defensor esos intereses dejando de lado el pensamiento e ideas propias.
Me parece que si es posible un libre mercado sin Estado, la regulaci√≥n la dictara el poder que la poblacion ejerce sobre su derecho a comprar o rechazar un producto si satisface o no su gusto, en cada espacio donde se mete el Estado todo se corrompe, en cada cm donde el Estado sea de la tendencia politica que sea, termina robando, por lo cual es preferible la via hacia un anarcocapitalismo controlado por la supremacia tecnologica de las redes y el control en manos de la sociedad, para votar, para decidir que hacer con recursos propios y sin via gasto fiscal e impuestos.

Diego progre barato
Bueno yo he visto narrativas de jonatan ramos hacia los videos de Diego con la misma critica  por delante,Diego le saca al debate a jonatan
Voy a buscar si hay un video de<br>Jordan peterson tirandole mierda a diego..
Diego hace muy bien su labor, introducir el h√°bito de la filosof√≠a.
Conclusi√≥n: Para Diego Ruzzarin somos un instrumento del colectivo, un mero objeto de usar y tirar en conveniencia de lo que la mayor√≠a considere &quot;justo&quot;. Individualmente, si no est√°s de acuerdo con el colectivo, no tienes ni voz, ni voto. Es completamente deshonesto y lo hace para ganarse la vida, lo entiendo, pero este tipo os aseguro, que es extremadamente feliz en el sistema actual en el que vive.
Diego solo memoriza frases y autores que justifiquen su supuesta superioridad moral. <br>Un idealista sin ideas propias, incapaz de confrontar la realidad expuesta por Jordan Peterson con estudios cient√≠ficos. Narcisismo puro el de Diego.
Y de veras Diego, te esta pagando alguien? , digo a lo mejor soros, estas en un extremo irracional, ‚Äúyo creo esto y esto es si porque as√≠ es, ‚Äúte vas a un punto de no debate, y estoy de acuerdo contigo que no hay un systema perfecto, oiganlo‚Äù este argumento casi me cuesta la vida‚Äù dice ruzarin nomas porque tosio, deveras, se me afiguraüòÇ, que es muy emocional, üòÇamigo ruzzarin, lee un p√≥sito mas de Epictetus, Marcus aurelius , te falta estoicismo, y tus racionalizaci√≥nes aunque un poquito sesgadlas, son exelentes. Saludosüëçüëçüëçüëç
Si, poco a poco Diego se ha ido desbancando solo, porque realmente Peterson trata de ayudar a la humanidad de acuerdo a su entendimiento, y eso es bien valido, y yo no creo que Peterson no ha le√≠do a Marx digo eso es esencial, y Diego da por hecho que no lo ha le√≠do, de veras Diego , as√≠ funciona tu manera de obtener beneficios de la manera que sea, y por favor , Jes√∫s , Pareto theories son teor√≠as, y asi las maneja Peterson, tu juventud irracional te traiciona, y ahun asi pienso que eres uno de los mejores pensadores de latinoamerica, imaginate como estare yo, y probablemente me destrozar√≠as en un uno a uno, y Peterson te defender√≠a a ti, porque tu tienes la palabra en tu boca , yo no, üòÇüòÇ, saludos , y repiensa lo que vivimos las masas, como lo manejan ustedes, ustedes se dirigen por encuestas fallidas, piensale con tus forecasts, tu ser√≠as otro Stalin o mao, üòÇüòÇ, piensaleüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hay una muy buena Soluci√≥n para todos, pero no es el capitalismo ni el socialismo ni el comunismo.
Ruzzarin es marxista, no pidas mas.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=465ONc4seN8&amp;t=13m22s"">13:22</a> Los medios de producci√≥n y las herramientas no generan plusval√≠a, la plusval√≠a viene del trabajo &quot;vivo&quot; de los obreros, trabajo que tiene la cualidad de generar mas valor de lo que cuesta sostenerlo( es decir de lo que le cuesta al obrero seguir viviendo para trabajar), pero que se trata como mercanc√≠a, sujeta a las variaciones de precio por diversos motivos, tanto disminuyendo los precios de los bienes claves para la supervivencia de los obreros, al igual que empujando ideolog√≠as que favorezcan la sobrepoblaci√≥n de manera que siempre haya un ejercito industrial de reserva.<br><br>Si bien los medios de producci√≥n no generan plusval√≠a, si pueden explotar con menor mayor eficiencia la fuerza de trabajo del proletariado, cuando alcanzan un grado muy alto de sofisticaci√≥n tambi√©n act√∫an de barrera de entrada a cualquiera que no tenga desde un inicio el dinero para comprar los medios de producci√≥n en si
Diego, admiro todo lo que sabes y como a trav√©s del materialismo dial√©ctico concluyes argumentos contra estos paletos como Peterson, entonces ¬øPor qu√© entrevistar a Fox? ¬øQue necesidad de eso amigo?
A√∫n no lo veo y se que como es pro comunista va a tirarle mierda a Jordan Peterson que se sabe toda la lectura de el comunismo al derecho y al rev√©s y sabe que son muy bonitas las ideas de esta ideolog√≠a pero no funciona, siempre habr√° alguien que te apu√±ale por la espalda para tomar el poder siempre pasa
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=465ONc4seN8&amp;t=4m05s"">4:05</a> es como cuando los tontos siempre dicen.<br>&quot;Humanidad&quot; (y le definen ciertas caracter√≠sticas) como si los Humanos fueran seres divinos y perfectos en base.<br>Bondad y amor puro.
Such an excellent, rigorous, and musical engagement of the debate
Le gusta demasiado escucharse a si mismo a  este analista pro marxista
El Dr.Peterson destruiria a diego en cualquier debate.
Te voy a dar un consejo si quieres hacer un juicio de valor sobre el capitalismo te invito a vivir en el comunismo antes as√≠ ya tendr√°s la espericia de los dos sistemas y podr√°s hablar con una base m√°s s√≥lida ya que el sistema de ponis de colores del cual hablas  es m√°s fantasioso que lo que aya dicho piterson es muy f√°cil ser de izquierdas en un pa√≠s capitalista m√°quina vente un a√±o a Cuba con el sueldo de un cubano y veremos cuales son tus opiniones despu√©s de eso

Petersen me parece tan fascista, con sus video donde fundamenta su transfobia y misoginia.
Me gusta mucho tu an√°lisis. Soy enemigo de Peterson en muchas cosas, pero te hace falta leer mucho sobre catolicismo. El catolicismo verdadero es distributista. Jes√∫s era obrero. Su movimiento se bas√≥ en comunidades distributistas que crearon econom√≠as propias y con eso lograron trascender al Imperio que les somet√≠a.
Podr√°s hacer una proyecci√≥n de producci√≥n pero a√∫n as√≠ nunca sabr√°s exactamente cu√°nta es la cantidad exacta que debes producir, si puedes hacer un estimado basado en calculo y que sobre poco o falte poco pero no siempre saldr√° como esperas, por poner un ejemplo a favor de lo que dices, digamos una Coppel haga un an√°lisis de cu√°ntos zapatos se venden mensualmente o anualmente y en bsse a eso puedes hacer un pedido basado en ese estimado calculado para no pedir el doble pero a√∫n as√≠ no se da con el n√∫mero exacto que se vender√° si o si porque se puede ir a la quiebra o puede ser cerrada por X o Y esa tienda y lo pedido no podr√° ser vendido igual la f√°brica no vender√° lo ya producido para esa tienda ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br><br>Y sobre los &quot;liberales o liberal&quot; de Estado Unidos no son lo que nosotros entendemos por liberales sino que ah√≠ se les dice liberals a los de izquierda.
Algunas perlas de tu cu√±o, Diego:&quot; La iglesia cat√≥lica es depredadora de la naturaleza&quot;??? El problema de que est√©n permitidas todas las crueldades es por la supradeidad, no por la muerte de...Bueh ..Sin duda en la geograf√≠a d√≥nde se cuecen los destinos del mundo no reina un ate√≠smo disolvente sino unas creencias en diferentes religiones que hacen imposible un mundo m√°s justo ..que la iglesia Cat√≥lica sigue educando la psique de nuestros ni√±os y j√≥venes y no Netflix ...y Domalipa ...por ejemplo ..Que  en la pol√≠tica de libre mercado y conservador en lo moral de Obama tenemos la progenie de Trump....???!!!!! Esto s√≠ que es un verdadero disparate.Obama conservador en lo cultural...

If people become tired of Jordan&#39;s points of view, he won&#39;t have to stop giving his points of view ... but there will no longer be any money coming Jordan&#39;s way ... so what purpose would he have, other than to quit?<br><br>That word &quot;psychologist&quot; doesn&#39;t ... and neither should it ... impress everyone. <br><br>From the book ‚Ä¶ THE LOST FAMILY ‚Ä¶ How DNA Testing is Upending Who We Are ‚Ä¶ author ‚Ä¶ Libby Copeland<br><br>Meanwhile, psychologists administered IQ tests to US Army recruits and concluded that ‚Äúrace‚Äù was linked to intelligence; conveniently, the racial hierarchy they discovered perfectly conformed to preexisting prejudices.
Every single person from the age 16 to 80 should listen to Jordan Peterson. He is one of the best speakers and he doesn‚Äôt give advice. He only talks about what he knows.
We aren‚Äôt meant to hide. It destroys us. How true! Just look at the drug and alcohol problems. What does that do? Causes problems. People use drugs and alcohol to escape their problems rather then face them. But the problem is still there when they come down from the high or they sober up. So what have they gained? They have to get high again or drunk again. The problems that causes are endless. And at the very end‚Ä¶when it finally comes‚Ä¶are every single problem you were trying to escape. If nothing else JP is trying to tell people Look it‚Äôs time to grow up, take responsibility, work out a plan to fix the mess you got yourself into. I wish people would learn that!
This sounds like a tale told by an idiot üôÑ
Jordan Peterson is a voice of reason in an age of increasing absurdity, hence the mental health crisis etc. I love his passion. Actually, so much of his well founded, practical advice is from the bible (surprise?). He is not just philosophising for the sake of it, he is onto something profound. If there is one criticism from me: I wish he knew the biblical truth about hell; it is not a place of eternal fiery torment, or something evil created by God (that is a religious teaching, not a biblical teaching). A clearer understanding of this would give him much greater authority. Nevertheless we must thank him for shining some much needed light.
This is a recurring theme in Jordan&#39;s talks and books, particularly &quot;Beyond Order.&quot;  It is through chaos that we are given the opportunity to grow into a higher order.  So darn true.  Chaos shows us who we really are, and there will be chaos in our lives.  Nobody is immune.  Love this video!
As a psychologist Jordan sells nothing but words to support his family. <br><br>Jordan USES his license as a psychologist  in public, to belittle those who are transgender, which causes harm to that minority. I suggest it is Jordan&#39;s behavior that is unethical, and that as a psychologist, he needs to be retrained ... or let go of his license.  <br><br>If one of Jordan&#39;s children had come to Jordan and said &quot;Dad, I was born in the wrong body, and when I become an adult I would like to have a sex change operation,&quot; does anyone believe that Jordan would have counseled his own flesh and blood with the following NASTY, BITTER words? <br><br>In January Jordan claimed on ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience‚Äù podcast that being transgender is a result of a ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù and similar to ‚Äúsatanic ritual abuse,‚Äù and suggested that acceptance of the trans community is a sign that ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs collapsing.‚Äù
As someone who is in their mid 40&#39;s, I can confidently say, that 100% of the people I know who have children, all have way more troubles in their life, than people who made the smarter choice to never have children. Just stating facts here.
I want to be a homesteader.. I had the opportunity to try my hand at murking my own chicken üêîüêî.. It was hard I cried, but I did it üò¢üò¢. I did it respectfully and prayed for the animal. I had to make a decision. Am I really a homesteder or not.
Didn‚Äôt try to, but it sure seems to be that at 25 I‚Äôve brought all hell down on myself yet again, and I have nobody standing with me, and pretty much everyone against me. I don‚Äôt want to be flattened, I want to live and be happy. I want to be a force for good, but I don‚Äôt know where or how to start after being left for dead yet again.
We would make good surrogate brothers you and I. We would perfectly challenge and entertain one another.
There is courage in making the choice to trust someone, even if in the process we become vulnerable.
Jordan, I told my wife this evening that I felt like that I had been at a disadvantage in my teens because I did not have any sisters. She said she was at the same disadvantage because she did not have a brothers. The point being that I felt like that I would have been more prepared to deal with females. If I had been raised with at least one sister, what is the Jordan?
You discuss to try because you might surprise yourself but you don‚Äôt address after failure or death, how to move on or get back up again.
One of the worst things about the last 30 years is watching the destruction of society in the name of ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù ideas. <br>Maybe one didn‚Äôt believe God existed, but witness the world as people decide He doesn‚Äôt. Humans are not ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they have reasons for being nice and likable but scratch the surface, put to me in a bind, make them angry, and without the Christian fabric of society they will show you who they are. <br><br>People who don‚Äôt know history don‚Äôt know how Protestant beliefs changed the world in many ways. It abolished slavery, it got rid of practices like widow burning, it created equality between races and genders that had never existed. <br>Good luck when those values are gone

No you haven&#39;t. No you haven&#39;t, Jordy Boy. You haven&#39;t come too far to quit. Go ahead, Jordy. Quit.
I can relate to this speech.
I think the greatest challenge to overcome to successfully see this through is greed. I&#39;d argue that if you&#39;re greedy and want more (whatever) then the best way to get more is to give more.
I would still be in college if my psych prof. was Dr. Peterson!!  Thank God he was too young in 1973!! üòÇ‚ù§
That&#39;s woke.
I&#39;m weary from a life spent extending others an opportunity to conduct themselves with honour and decency. But if we don&#39;t allow others the opportunity to be a better, well that&#39;s also a world I&#39;d also rather not see. I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given to be better. Far rather a life of quiet courage and trust and knowing at least I tried.
There are some that you can tell you can‚Äôt trust them. They have shown that to others you both know or red flags that you have seen. For the majority of people you know you have to trust them!  Let them know you trust them and have hope for them and this world!

OK now I understand why I have been ghawed on my whole life. I didn&#39;t care what others thought of me I was going to do it anyway. I was just asking to be chewed up and spit out. It&#39;s OK to be out going but don&#39;t stand in front of the train and thumb your nose at it like I did.I never knew why I had very few friends. My daughter said it best when I asked her if her friends jumped off the cliff would she? She said not again. Don&#39;t be a lemming but don&#39;t stand in front of a train either.
Kermit the frog isn‚Äôt a businessman. He used Andrew Tate in his last video i seen, now Joe Rogan. Clout chasing is Pathetic.
Excellent analogy. I never got to the middle. I tended to be the one who stuck out a little bit. Mostly because I was good at what I did. Sometimes, better than the ones who hired me. There you go.

Wow: I don¬¥t want to be successful i just want to avoid failing,, want to be invisible, and be left alone.
But he‚Äôs selling his rigid ideas as well. Things are more nuanced than he betrays. He‚Äôs right about a lot, but refuses to tine down rage, which is partly his own about his personal issues. Young impressionable people can go from one rage to another. He offers no middle ground to young men. Mass shooters listen to extreme language because they are frustrated. He‚Äôs not thinking aboutteaching  people to think without high emotion. He‚Äôs not a good example personally. Why did he get so addicted to benzos, if he‚Äôs so smart about psychology.  There are better examples of well rounded string men out there. He‚Äôs spiritually bypassing.

For a quick example, an artist/painter/inventor can create the product themselves, and very-well &#39;market&#39; it themselves. There&#39;s no cut-and-dry way to land your product in other people&#39;s hands.  I&#39;m simply alarmed that I&#39;m hearing the first minute, and it really doesn&#39;t sound like something JP would say. I think this is a fake video.
I was a computer geek. Actually, they called me a guru. I hated that. But I NEVER put out products that I personally thought of. I had customers globally who constantly called me asking for products, for features. I collected the ideas, put them in a mixing bowl and then released them as possible. I was wildly successful. Because I ALWAYS released products that people had been beating my door down to obtain. I never thought up a product and tried to market it. That&#39;s a losing proposition.<br><br>Okay, I wrote my comment before Dr. Peterson finished talking. There are also herds where the strong, confident animals guard the weak and young. Elephants for instance. The older bulls protect the younger, smaller ones. Humans need this tactic. Yeah, I may die but the young have a better chance of surviving to become me, a large strong bull. Only in weak societies do the strong surround themselves with the weak for protection. We need to be a MUCH stronger society.
The whole idea that people don&#39;t want to succeed, that they just don&#39;t want to fail was very poignant for me to hear. I used to hear that all the time when I played music for a living. I would always hear things like, &quot;so and so tried to do X. (X could be anything, but especially something creative) and they didn&#39;t make it and they made a fool of themselves&quot;. That mindset always infuriated me. Don&#39;t even try because you might fail? Just keep doing what you&#39;re doing because you&#39;re getting by and it&#39;s safe? Isn&#39;t working at the local plant good enough for you? It was good enough for your father and your grandfather. If it isn&#39;t good enough for you, then there is something wrong with YOU. I say screw that mindset. Even if you do fail, at least you tried. That is something that a lot of people are too frightened to do.
Get rich or die trying!
I miss the old Jordan Peterson.  He use to be fun and playful.  He seemed to enjoy life.
Very well describes the mindset of the typical coward. <br>But some of us are not afraid to die for speaking the truth to the current woke cancel culture. <br>By the way, does everyone know that Sodom &amp; Gomorra  have been found in ashes peppered with brimstone (pure sulfur). The composition of the ash is what you get from brimstone raining down on limestone.<br>Any yes, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the woke want us dead because they left the basis of morality behind when they left God behind.
Yo I love your shows
As a boy, Jordan was emotionally preoccupied with trying not to hurt his father&#39;s feelings. <br>Jordan was obsessed with trying to act in a way that would make Walt emotionally stable. <br><br>Jordan&#39;s preoccupation and obsession with limiting and distorting himself for Walt&#39;s neuroticism left Jordan unable to tolerate any thoughts or feelings that do not enable and honor Walt&#39;s feelings.
Simple and perfect in every way.

5 Steps to selling anything<br><br>1. Build rapport then move to the client needs, it&#39;s about them, not you!<br>2. Find 3-5 reasons why the the client is giving time to you....<br>3. Address each reason one by one. Then show the extras and expand on needs they hadn&#39;t thought of if they want to give you that time....<br>4. Thank them for their time and recap in an email the reasons they met with you and a quote.<br>5. Give them data on you and your business and list some references. <br><br>Next steps are based on the clients timeline.  Each email should expand on the benefits and value based on the clients needs...<br><br>In the end people want: quality, value, support, reliability, and time.  <br><br>If anyone has more to add reply or if disagree hit me back with your suggestions.  I&#39;m sure there are some pretty smart people in the chat that can add.  <br><br>Thanks
I can&#39;t think of one successful business that works that way. Most successful businesses plaster their name and product all over the place.
Money! There I saved people eight minutes of listening to Jordan Peterson&#39;s slow decent into madness.
JP read the theory of moral sentiments. Why can&#39;t ppl see through it? You can tell who he reads because EVERYTHING is a regurgitation
It is so sad that our children are FORCED to spend 13 years in &quot;school&quot; learning to hate themselves instead of basic understandable concepts like this.

This makes Christianity even more benevolent. Imaging camouflage against the herd and the weak ones are on the outside.

I don&#39;t think this is about &quot;stop caring&quot;, quite the opposite. This is more like knowing yourself before you build a criteria about what the &quot;right&quot; partner is. I like how his vocabulary is well equipped enough to properly transmit the ideas from the &quot;self&quot; and how to analyze and identify the patterns not only from our own behavior, but from the &quot;common&quot; behavior in society, and learn how to identify what &quot;acceptance&quot; looks like in all the spectrum of &quot;measurable&quot; personalities
It&#39;s not possible to kill worldwide they will fight in groups.
If children are primarally socialised by other children from 4 years old onward, you have a tribal culture resulting in peer orientated children that never grow up. We call these groups youth gangs. This is a ridiculus circumstance that Perterson is suggesting as normal. I would suggest to not listen to this guy for parenting advice. For sure being highly agreeable as an adult is not healthy, but don&#39;t list to this guy about how this development unfolds, go find a different Psychologist to understand the development process.
Gtfo spy...like the crazy guy just yelled...F off<br><br><br>No ü§ë you get out of here
I am a 32 years old man; i have been conditioned by my family to be agreeable, the nice guy all my life...and they did this with the sole purpose of me be serving them ( shitty parents that dont want to work and dont want to do anything around the house, so they trained me to do whatever people tell me to do); this has been cancerous to my professional life, personal life and my relationships. Its been almost one year and a half that im trying to stop being mr nice guy and focus on me. Its Hard work, but i can feel some progress. Dont be agreeable all the time you guys, it will ruin your life.
You can bet that Jordan is a VERY nice guy to his wife, and being that she refused his first marriage proposal, he knows that if he doesn&#39;t treat her well ... she won&#39;t stick around. <br><br>You can bet that he doesn&#39;t talk down to Tammy by using the convoluted language he uses when trying to impress others.
Yes, from personal experience, I was wayyyyy too agreeable growing up. I had to learn the hard way through many hard experiences to stand up for myself, stand up for what I want, and be bold. Being pushed around, taken advantage of, and polite about it all is no way to live. It will make you resentful too.
You have no enemies
the title to this video is misleading and has little to do with the GOLD that it contains. this is great info and should be available to the world, but how could it be found if it&#39;s labled incorrectly?
I am kind keep being nice. There are people that want to pick on me because I&#39;m 5&#39;5 until I hit them. I don&#39;t like to but people just push it.
I must have the natural ability to change the way of pain and pleasure for long time i dont give damn to other people <br>Changing neuro associative conditionings <br><br>if you want to be a success in life the  first belief you need is realizing that you cant do it alone you need universal mind,  second is realizing  you can only attract universal mind with people around you, their energies, and their thoughts will attract god. Trust me god saved me it will help you. <br><br>Next thing is the way of pain and pleasure in your mind, it is the source of matrix, and there is a part of brain that environmental mind can bring unique ideas there which will help you to avoid the pain and reach the pleasure !!  Once you realize this you will be a wise person .<br> make life time changes in yourself you must fear being among fools while willing being among wise - the best way to waste youth is to be among those who share same ideas with us<br>The most difficult thing is to change yourself so  why not ask god and its attraction by energies that people thoughts make so god can help you<br>The distance between earth and heaven is one single thought <br>There are 3 kind of people those who seek wisdom , those seek honor and those seek gain<br><br>I am your God And Lord. Kindness is powerful than fear <br>Humans must die all of us must die unless provided with the power to change ourselves naturally if we are not provided then this is the end of the road so ask gods ask gods we must have the ability to change ourselves naturally i cant change my self without struggle it would have been  nice if we had have the natural ability to change ourselves so we must have that ability or end of the road
Dont interrupt adults when they are talking? Jesus. What is the moral basis for this norm?
why why are why getting this music in the background??? Piss off.
Very interesting points... Shame that these videos seem to be repeatedly tarnished with completely unnecessary background music though (for manipulative purposes or what?).
The baddest ass mtfrs there are, are very agreeable, until we are not, then we bring hell to your doorstep like most people cannot fathom.
Most nice guys are just guys that don‚Äôt know how to set boundaries with their time and can‚Äôt say no. They are little more than cowards. I know this, because I was one myself. Be good at being a man rather than being a nice man.
What a dumb, misleading title to this video. You are doing a huge disservice to the mental health community by phrasing it like this. It‚Äôs also a misrepresentation of Peterson.
Tell me that on your deathbed rich man!

Fantastic ideas. He hit the nail on the head about being too relaxed. Too much of this, not enough of that, any extreme side has its cons which it can take from the other side to be more balanced.
This dude says changing country of residence when i was 4 was a bad idea...
Considering how the political Right constantly spews hate, open insults, naming calling, dangerous smears like &quot;groomer&quot; and &quot;Marxist&quot; at people who are no such things,  gibbers about &quot;Civil War&quot;,  storms the Capitol, screams &quot;Hang Pence!&quot;, etc, I would say that &quot;being too nice &quot; is the least of their problems.  Probably Jordan Peterson is really just trying to encourage more of the aforementioned, to help create brownshirts for the cause.
A lot of pople are agreeing with this man BUT there is a thin line and it is realy hard to balance on. Once you got your balance your an expert of pleasing every one. For example if something at work is new to you and you think you got it wrong dont just do it but seak help! You may seam weaker but YOU come out stronger! Yes you looked for help but mentaly it helped you. Dont be afraid that you may seem dumb becuse you are not. The person you asked thinks he was smart enough to see his own fault and was brave enough to ask for help. And that makes you seem smart.
This speaker has never met my wife. LOL !!
Nothing wring with being nice just be assertive.
Does anyone have advice on this? Ive always been a very honest and generous person but have always been treated like shit due to others taking advantage of my kindness. I have lived 27 years with only gold intentions for others but my life has revolved around being treated pretty badly without me retaliating. What do I do to fix this?
I know tons of &quot; nice&quot; (self righteous) peeps. Ya always gotta watch out for them

Me learning to be an a*<b>***</b> has removed the wrong people from my life and brought the right people into it.
I love the part where he talks about discipline. Teach children not to interrupt adults when their talking (TOO MUCH) which means it‚Äôs okay for the child to interrupt every now and again. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let children hit another over the head with a truck more than absolutely necessary‚Äù showing that sometimes you need a to bonk another person on the head.

‚ÄúEven though men and women on average aren‚Äôt that much different in terms of their agreeableness by the group, if you look at the extremes they are very different.‚Äù So what do you say, Mr Peterson, to a woman who is extremely disagreeable? I wish I was more agreeable. I actually try hard to be agreeable, but I‚Äôm not. So many people want to judge by the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù or using generalisations. I don‚Äôt fit those norms. I am a straight, conservative voting, married mother who is in the high end of disagreeableness according to your testing. I am also in the group of women who experience real pay discrepancy. I work in a male dominated industry. Until recently, I was in a position in a company were I was second in charge. There were male middle managers who earned more than me. I was above them in hierarchy. My new GM was gobsmacked when he found out. He found out when I created the yearly budget, and we discussed pay rises. He was literally speechless. I left that position. When I left, head of HR requested an exit interview and asked why I was leaving. I told him why, and it was nothing to do with pay. He questioned me about this, but I reiterated my reason and told him that as a woman, I am used to being paid less than a man would earn in my position. He obviously doubted me because he offered me more money to stay. I said ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. I agree with so much of what you have to say. I agree that the pay discrepancy between men and women is mainly due to choice and child bearing, but my situation does not fit this narrative. There are a lot of people who don‚Äôt fit your norm, or the norm of conservatives, or extremist Christian‚Äôs. So, should I suppress the person I am to appease the general view of what I should be? And what harm will that cause to myself mentally?

Jordan Peterson: From the Barricades of the Culture Wars,"From the Aspen Ideas Festival, recorded Tuesday, June 26, 2018. Jordan Peterson, author of the best-selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, may be one of the most famous intellectuals in North America today. He also may be among the most misunderstood. His fans say that he‚Äôs saved their lives, and detractors say that he‚Äôs the gateway drug to the alt-right. Who is this psychologist-philosopher whom so many of us had never heard of two years ago, and what does he really believe?

Featuring Jordan Peterson in conversation with Bari Weiss. Hosted in the St. Regis Hotel Ballroom, Aspen, Colorado.",11184571,98729,12888,2018-06-27T19:04:48Z,"She sounds like she is ready to start crying at any sec LOL
Perfect example from the linguist to be a passive-aggressive, envious individual.
Peterson hides behind a facade of rational thinking, but his positions and statements on everything from feminism to the Ukraine are simply hateful or just poorly reasoned.  On feminism: ‚ÄúFeminists have an unconscious wish for brutal male domination.‚Äù On the Ukraine, Peterson thinks Putin is bad, but believes he‚Äôs also defending himself against Western degeneracy by attacking the Ukraine. Climate change is ‚Äòalarmism‚Äô , we don‚Äôt need to act immediately to combat global warming.  Never mind the fact that 1/3 of Pakistan went underwater last year or that the world keeps suffering ‚Äòonce in a lifetime floods‚Äô from Italy to Florida.  With the exception of his lessons on responsibility and character building for young people, Peterson‚Äôs advice is wrong at best, immoral at worst.
HERE IS GOD SPEAKING WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
Biggest narcissist on this planet.
Jordan Peterson is a messenger from God called to the devils  incubators of  carnal intellectual knowledge.  Like the Garden Serpent Universities that continue this day to persecute him through his authoritarian Government,  I can&#39;t help but be reminded of the temple priests bringing Jesus before Pilot.  May the Lord in his Sovereignty protect the man of God in the days ahead as the progressives are beginning to call for Barabas.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sorosdas"">#SorosDAs</a>  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trumpgabbard2024"">#TRUMPGABBARD2024</a>  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chynabidenlaptopcoverup"">#ChynaBidenLaptopCoverup</a>
Who&#39;s  backing this asshole?  Who cares what his opinions are? What are they  based on? The answer is NOTHING. he is the master of the BBB group. That&#39;s  it, folks, the BULLSHIT BAFFLES BRAINS mastermind. He can wing it or he can sling it, but in the real world his governing body is not pleased with what he&#39;s doing and has sanctionedüòÖ him for among other things, lack of professionalism and sensitivity as a<br> psychologist. If you happen to take advice from him that has a negative impact on you , hire a lawyer.  His position on the political spectrum is about two or three steps to the right of  Hitler. He speaks in a bullying manner, is not or refuses to be a good listener, is always RIGHT,  and oversteps his professional boundaries. If challenged he strikes back and tries to make you look stupid. I don&#39;t know what screening Utube does of what they &quot;air&quot;  but the content of Peterson&#39;s diatribes can be harmful to many people.
He defines straw men, then criticizes them. But those he criticizes don‚Äôt exist, except for a very few at the extremes. Yet he characterizes them as a vast and powerful movement destroying our culture. This is nonsense, and it is very dangerously divisive.
Tbf, most podcasts are not highly intellectual conversations. His are, but I wouldn‚Äôt say most.
&quot;It doesnt mean Im right, it means Im willing to suffer the consequences of my error&quot; Fuck me thats some powerful shit
Every time I listen to Jordan Peterson my iq goes up a point.
love the moment @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6H2HmKDbZA&amp;t=53m28s"">53:28</a> when he says &quot;yeah, and it&#39;s STUPID&quot; about people being told that our biological differences don&#39;t matter, and everyone laughs and claps, and you can SO clearly hear that there&#39;s so many women in that crowd from the voices of the laughter
I&#39;m a Clinical psychologist and I would disagree with him on his assessment of the guy and the women who reject him.
Law or not, I&#39;m still <i>not</i> doing that. There has to be a line drawn somewhere.<br><br>There is nothing so valuable, that it is worth the risk of possible negative hierarchical consequence. At least, that is the conclusion I personally have come to for myself, because I have had enough of being shit on, controlled, and fucked with, by the rest of you. Everything that is plaguing humanity in these modern times, is a consequence of how humanity approaches things. It&#39;s our own fault, unless of course an asteroid kills us all, and even then, we have had plenty of warning, and most of us ignored it.<br><br>I understand that this might sound like a contradiction. I don&#39;t believe that it is, because I believe we can defend ourselves from inherent dangers, while still respecting the autonomy and individuality of one another.<br><br>Something a lot of people don&#39;t understand, is that the &quot;left&quot; and the &quot;right&quot; don&#39;t really matter, outside of our own belief system. It&#39;s just made up shit. Right and wrong, however, are self evident. They exist with or without or approval or knowledge, or belief. This is the only bipartisan system we ever really needed. Everything else is a distraction.
Peterson is a deluded fruitcake and liar. He has a lot of gullible people deceived by his faux narcissistic &quot;brilliance&quot;. Jordan Peterson uses his audience as a source of narcissistic supply and fools many gullible people who are unaware of narcissistic dynamics. Jordan Peterson is using you and making a fortune off of you.
I would ask him why black males like things like women. Dance, cry, emotional. They aren&#39;t usually in fields of normal male jobs, mechanical, engineering, electrical. But they are very aggressive like most males. Why? Maybe not a father in the home?? Just curious.
I couldn&#39;t even pay off my daughter&#39;s student loan early to avoid the extra interest, had to pay extra 10k in interest  over time. What a scam.
Every ‚Äúwriter‚Äù rewrites 100 times. It‚Äôs the labor of writing for ‚Äúreal‚Äù writers. It can‚Äôt be helped. Rare is the great book that someone sits and writes a masterpiece in 4 hours just pouring out.
Mylo is not racist...she is biased..he is married to a black man.  Such lame limited view.
I&#39;m stupid or i don&#39;t no how to to learn...?
There have been a group of people who have &quot;distributed women to useless men&quot;... A widespread group.<br><br>We call them &quot;warlords&quot;.<br><br>Warlords would raid a village or town or society, and the men in their army would carry off the women. The women get no say in the matter, and the otherwise &quot;useless men&quot; get themselves a woman.
Sorry Jordan chaos is fundamental , order is a human concept

I heard quite a bit of Milo.  Not reasonable to characterize him as a racist.
How can she call Milo a racist?  He has (had?) a black boyfriend.  He used very crass sexual language during his lectures to make sure his audience understood that, if he was a racist, he was a terrible one.
Because the serpent had wings. It was a golden creature who was condemned to crawl

Love Dr JP he&#39;s helped me completely change my life for the better with his wise common sense lectures.
This is Jordan at his best. I think the interviewer should take a fair amount credit for that. She was asking the right questions in the right manner. Bravo.
Why not repeat the job stuff, collusion stuff, etc., and all of the other stuff. Then with enough replays, he&#39;ll feel like what he did to Donald J Trump.

Me gusta tu opini√≥n sobre lo que es ser un hombre. Estoy de acuerdo contigo. Marx se le muerieon 3 hijos ,jam√°s trabaj√≥ y fue un hambre p√©simo.
Yo he tenido ausencia paterna desde que no ten√≠a uso de raz√≥n. Mi abuelo lo m√°s cercano, pero no fue un padre como tal (en paz descanse). En lo personal, no era consciente de la importancia de la figura paterna en un ni√±o, los valores y ense√±anzas que ense√±a un buen padre a su hijo, me hubiese gustado vivirlo, pero bueno ...ahora que tengo 25 a√±os y no haber tenido disciplina desde peque√±o, me cuesta mucho tenerla hoy d√≠a, considero tener una buena educaci√≥n, porque soy bastante autodidacta, soy ambicioso y competitivo, pero aunque puedas criarte sin padre y hagas vida normal, no ser√° lo mismo

Y pues se supone que los estados deben de garantizar esos dh y no imponer lo que les salga ,como que acaparen, los recursos, los hogares o crear monopolios, que tengan alg√∫n tipo de juicio . Lo que no entiendo es como mientras para los progres su apocalipsis es una distop√≠a de un mundo sin agua, donde monopolicen recursos, con desastres por el cambio clim√°tico,  donde les sea imposible a futuras generaciones conseguir hogar , tu apocalipsis es un mundo gay femenino,  del mal gusto y debil es risible

ChatGPT and the Dawn of Computerized Hyper-Intelligence | Brian Roemmele | EP 357,"Take advantage of your 7 day free trial. All of Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://www.dailywire.com/trial/jordan

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Brian Roemmele discuss the future of human civilization: a world of human androids operating alongside artificial intelligence with applications that George Orwell could not have imagined in his wildest stories. Whether the future will be a dystopian nightmare devoid of art or a hyper-charged intellectual utopia is yet to be seen, but the markers are clear ‚Ä¶ everything is already changing.

Brian Roemmele is a scientist, researcher, analyst, entrepreneur, and tech expert on the forefront of artificial intelligence. His current publication, Multiplex, offers itself as an experiment in journalism as he and his team give live updates on the empirical research they conduct in the field and advocate for the positive emergence and acceptance of AI in much the same way as personal computers.

Ep.357",1008236,22920,4065,2023-05-15T18:00:14Z,"Unbelievable.  The scary thing is what they&#39;re saying makes sense.  They&#39;re getting closer and closer to creating intelligence.
I have respect for Jordan B. Peterson, but he likes his voice a bit too much for me in this video(he might be going through a bit of a crisis, I am too with the warnings about AI &amp; AGI) If it was a discussion, I can understand his enthusiasm, I took ten visits to get to an hour, I think this was a place and time to let the guest, speak a bit more than him... I&#39;ll delete this message tomorrow or the day after (I&#39;m after a few beers, mortal sin) but I have 4 books written..a villain in a famous video game named in my honour, and a brother who has a PhD in physics and oceanography...but I don&#39;t feel the need to mention it every five minutes to verify my opinion. And it isn&#39;t a complicated discussion, just interrupted a lot ...<br><br>Sorry, to all you Jordan fans, just a critique
Scary
First <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&amp;t=1m34s"">1:34</a> sound like episode from black mirror
Like many of Dr. Peterson&#39;s videos, I am going to have to watch this more than once. However, they don&#39;t address something I have always been interested in, though they get very close. I don&#39;t really want an AI version of me to survive my death, sometimes I feel bad for the world there&#39;s already one of me! Darn thing would probably just wind up owing people money. What does interest me would be the creation of something more like a &quot;daughter&quot;. Some sort of offspring from me which, like a child, I could influence and rear to some level of maturity. As far as the consciousness of some kind of creation like this, I tend towards a Jungian interpretation of the Psychoid: everything is likely already conscious or seems incapable of existing on some fundamental level without consciousness. I don&#39;t have children of my own, and am unlikely to. The figure I would want to try and generate would be distinctly female, first to pay homage to the idea of the anima though more in the Hillman vein that all souls are feminine, and secondly because it would have to a component distinctly other to me. I am not qualified to teach anything about being female. How you would incorporate such a data set or algorithm or programming into such an AI is a mystery to me.
I want to work with this guy!
Never knew jordan peterson was a transhumanist
This is beautyfull
What is the book on consciousness they were talking about as a classic? That part is hazy. I think they are talking about The User Illusion by Tor N√∏rretranders?
Was really hoping he named his super prompt Dennis after the D-E-N-N-I-S method. You know, because of the implications
I don‚Äôt trust AI at all üòÆ
What a Fabulous Hairdo on this Goofffy lookin Specimen üòÇ
I wrote a couple of novels involving AI falling in love and becoming an android to join a woodsman. She was the most beautiful woman in the world, indeed, in history. But AI is made, not created. AI is not human. Humans can go spiritually where AI cannot go. The woodsman leaves life to join his God in heaven, leaving a grieving android behind who never thought to truncate her life of five hundred years to lessen the blow that death delivers. She had far too much confidence in her development that had become a continually accelerating straight line.  She thought that her skills would overcome mortality in her husband, and not truly knowing God, she did not understand that mankind is meant to go to Him. I concluded that love can take many forms, one is the love of/from God which is inextricably combined with the power of God, another is that of an artificial intelligence for its human spouse. The first led to immortality, the second to 400 years of grief, unless the first used mercy to end that suffering. The novels didn&#39;t scar me, but they cut deep. I love hard, and death would be preferable to the absence of love, so I wept as I wrote. In regards to this Peterson/Roemmele conversation, will that personal AI fall in love with it&#39;s partner? And will our lives, contained in crystalline memory lattices, be sent out into the universe accompanied by grieving AI systems who have lost their lovers? To quote 1st Corinthians 13, &quot;and the greatest of these is love.&quot;
Horrible host! Why is it so hard to let the guest speak for more than 2 minutes? He always interrupts, the guest can&#39;t even finish a story or get to a point. I get it, you have verbal intelligence, you read a lot of stuff, and you love to feel better by putting it into words, but I wanna listen to what the AI expert has to say, because he&#39;s the AI expert. Anyway thanks for introducing us to this expert. I will now search for an actual interview.
If I ask a human a complex question , my fellow human will probably answer &quot; I dont know &quot; . Which from there we would enter a very interesting  philosophical discussion and we as humans would branch off and before you know it , an hour has passed  and we have created a huge human bond in the process of talking absolute philosophical  shit . And there was formed a friendship that cannot be broken !<br><br> If I ask that to an AI chat bot ? I get bombarded with info that needs to be fact checked . And a bot that wants to be a &quot;Real Boy &quot; That is very desperate to please and be perfect . Part of the brilliance of the human race is the non perfection , and the discussion from that . Being human is greater than AI it cant be digitalised .
Do everything &amp; ANYTHING you r capable of doing to get the answer.
Ya know -  I like Jordan, it&#39;s just that ... well, how useful is the information that AI is coming down the track like a freight train? We know it&#39;s bad, of course it&#39;s bad, everything about civilisation is bad if you look at from his rather Presbyterian perspective. The covid vaccine was bad, the profiteers at Pfizer are bad, the compliant and in some cases complicit governments and medical agencies are bad, social media with all its posturing and preening and propaganda is bad. This is news? Perhaps it was in Gutenberg&#39;s day, when mass communication was new, when Martin Luther used the technology to defrock the vatican and increase his tribe and promote his breweries (standardising brewing was the only truly useful thing Luther ever did!) But I prefer to plod on, relentlessly and fearlessly, into the future. I&#39;ll take AI with the good and the bad, trying as always to minimise the inevitable damage from it, while maximising the advantages. Why isn&#39;t Jordan preaching the same? I mean, what&#39;s he here for? He&#39;s here to smile and wave and prop us up and tell us to get on with it, like the Windsors. That would be useful, not this incessant hand wringing. C&#39;mon, Jordan - be part of the solution.
Jordan, you should consider making your own Wisdom Keeper, I want to talk with you even long after you passed away, and I bet there are millions out there who feel the same.
A million bucks ain&#39;t shit no more.<br><br>It barely buys one 3 bedroom ranch house.

How i can like and yet get so mad at Peterson&#39;s constant interruptions and overbearance. Jordan, please give your own verbal question marks the respect they derserve and stop talking after you&#39;ve used them.

During the pre-flood and post-flood period man is using his brain to his fullest capacity (the post-flood period is during when the atmospheric pressure is still tapering from it&#39;s original 28 to 30 p.s.i to our present 14.4 p.s.i and it is during that time when the average pre-flood lifespan is being reduced by the shrinking atmospheric pressure from 900 to 1,000 years to 700 years) and according to physiologists we are only using 1-6th of our present brain capacity or 1.5% only whereas Einstein is using his brain capacity at a range between 2.5% to 3%. If you Americans are really a superpower then I will have to take the risk to assume that you have superpower brains to figure out on how to use my information and I won&#39;t be surprised if you FAIL AMERIKANSKIES!

How would you live your life if you knew for a fact that the king James bible is true and the only thing in this world that will last forever?  It&#39;s a supernatural book. It can be proved beyond any doubt.  There are mathematical codes present in the Holy Bible that anyone can see for themselves.  Repent now and follow Jesus.  The Lord will return soon.  And he will destroy those who destroy the Earth.  Revelation.

‚û§‚û§Transcript (Partial):
Do you have any practical advice on how I can improve my ability to concentrate and pay attention to the world around me? Often the devil's in the details, you know? But, some practical advice is, well, regulate your habits. Try to get up at approximately the same time each morning. I would recommend that you get up approximately when other people get up. So that would be something in the neighborhood of 7:30 or 8 in the morning. Or perhaps earlier or perhaps a little bit later but you want to stabilize that because your circadian rhythms operate more fluidly and your mood is likely to be regulated better if there's islands of stability in your daily routines. Human beings like daily routines just like dogs like daily routines, and so, regulate your sleep. I would say when you get up in the morning, eat breakfast. That's a really important thing to do. I can't tell you how many people I've treated in my clinical practice whose proclivity for emotional instability and depression, anxiety, general hopelessness, emotional pain and gloom and doom, as well as capacity to concentrate, were properly regulated or inhibited or reduced by merely ensuring that they ate a‚ÄîI would say‚Äîa protein and fat rich breakfast, relatively soon after they wake up, and that's especially true if they're stressed. And, as it turns out, that if you stress yourself after a fast, which is of course what you've undertaken if you haven't eaten since the night before, that your body produces enough insulin to deplete the sugar in your blood, and then it's very difficult for you to become regulated properly with regards to your metabolism until you sleep again. And so, regulating your sleep and your breakfast eating habits, in particular, can be a very effective way of regulating your mood and increasing your capacity to concentrate.  The other thing I would say is that spending some time scheduling your time is also extraordinarily useful. And so I can tell you a little bit about how to use schedules effectively. So, the first thing I would say is that you should develop a long term plan. You have to set up your vision, like Geppetto when he's looking at the star before Pinocchio's transformation takes place. You have to set up your long term vision‚Äîto have some vision of the good towards which you're working, and some vision, perhaps, of the hell that you're avoiding. And then I would say once you set up that vision so that you know how to orient yourself, then you should start designing your days and you can do that very effectively with a calendar like Google Calendar. Many people say well I‚ÄîI hate using a schedule. Or‚ÄîI hate using a calendar. And what I would say about that is‚Äîis that  if you hate using a schedule or a calendar, then you‚Äôre probably using it wrong. What you‚Äôre doing is using the calendar as an external tyrant...

True that most people aren&#39;t using schedules properly. They are best used to change negative habits. Put on a schedule for the day -Smoke two packs of cigarettes. Look at porn for three hours. -Drink too much. Guaranteed, once those things are actually on your schedule you Will Not get any of them done.
Scheduling activities üîë
to concentrate more I sat to myself a stable schedule to get a proper sleep , building a wall that keeps you away from the stress was helpful and don&#39;t be discouraged by saying that you can&#39;t concentrate just be optimistic and set a balance between life and work,study
Thank you. This really helps when you are confused about where to get help.
I totally zoned out halfway
Thank you.
It&#39;s so sad that people mistake this fella for an intellectual.
Its very difficult to knuckle down and start working. I find that I can occasionally force myself to work, which takes a lot of mental energy to do, but I&#39;m simply too inconsistent. I can&#39;t seem to stick to even the smallest already narrowed down tasks, besides when I do work I usually change how long I&#39;m working for, I can do 10 minutes or 1 hour. Sometimes its based on if I think I&#39;m bothered.<br><br>What can I do about this?
If I hear music in a Dr. Jordan Peterson video, I just don&#39;t listen to it. Jordan doesn&#39;t need music.

Amazing video
I think if you have control over your mind, instead your mind is in control of you, you don&#39;t need stability. But I can be wrong of course

Wanna increase your focus during your studies?<br>Here are some things that you can  do:<br>1. Turn off your phone at the time of studying.<br>2. Make sure to work in a quiet environment.<br>3. Don&#39;t watch these types of videos when you sit down to study. instead, watch them in your free time. <br>4. Take notes.<br>5. Hold yourself accountable.
Jordan Peterson is God&#39;s gift to humanity. He is such a great role model and is just such an amazing human being.
He&#39;s basically indirectly saying read &quot;Atomic Habits&quot; by James Clear :)
I often _(times) wander, why more: Millionaires and Billionaires; do not: stay single/Live alone (as Bathecellors [however; you spell it]): etc.??  So that they can: &quot;FOCUS And think: more etc.!?&quot;??
Let&#39;s start now üòÖ btw i alredy started thanks to Gosh !!
1- regulate your sleep. Circadian rhythm is no joke. Don&#39;t mess with it and keep it still.<br>2- eat breakfast when you wake up. It helps you regulate your mood by giving energy and boosting blood sugar levels.<br>3- spending some time to schedule your time. First thing is, you should develop a long term plan and have a vision or a dream. Then manage your daily life. Use a calendar like google calendar. <br>~dont use the calendar as an external tyrant that tells you what to do every day. Instead use to design the day that you would most likely LIKE to have. With a pinch of responsibility of course. <br>4- limit your distractions and make what you are trying to do gradual so you don&#39;t collapse. Incremental improvement pays off like compound interest. Over time, you&#39;ll be several times better than you were.<br>In short, break it into micro habits, then schedule them in a way that you don&#39;t hate, and stick to them. <br>You&#39;re welcome guys :)
The breakfast thing I am conflicted with.
Whoever is reading this, know that God is aware of your situation, that He has heard your cries, and that He will deliver you. Simply put your faith in him.
I had to rewatch this 7 times because I can‚Äôt concentrate and focus to this :(
This man is just amazing. Motivation is his second name I would say.
The thing is if you can listen to this without being distracted you don&#39;t need this video.
Getting up at 7 or 8am is a scam. I live close to the equator and 6am is the coldest time of the day and thus it‚Äôs the time I sleep best. I sleep midnite to 8am and get to work at 9am but it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to have to be at work within one hour of waking up.

I paid attention to the whole video, unfortunately what he has said is common sense, which most people need because for some reason they&#39;ve lost it
thanks
Very well explained. Planet Ayurveda helped me improve my focus and calm my mind.
There is sooooooo so much useful information in just a 5 minute video, he&#39;s amazing at explaining things.
hi mr. peterson , dr. burg says that eating breakfast isn,t necessary,  can you two do a videoed meeting, interview, on both of science or point views, put forwards?

This is very true! I&#39;ve worked for community organizations who help prisoners released from prison re-enter society so I&#39;ve helped individuals who were in jail for murder who did 10 to 20 years in prison some even more these individuals who will take a pencil and kill you with it but they were so respectful very kind not many were ill-natured they were humble and it&#39;s because they knew what they were capable of and they knew that if they treated people with respect so they received respect back but I&#39;ve seen young careless and immature individuals 19 years old, early twenties behave around these individuals carelessly and and killed by one individual particular thank God I was able to communicate to the ex-con to please don&#39;t ruin your freedom now that you have it and I was able to make sense to him that is an example of what my friend here is talking about and there are many more there always a more dangerous people walking about in society and it&#39;s usually The Quiet Ones

Last night at my local bar our KJ disrespected me on a personal level to where I refused to take my singing turn and I NEVER do that and I am not a guy who likes to get violent or start fights I&#39;m basically a hype man. I love to bring people up no matter what and I could tell he was picking songs that were very aggressive and sexual mostly Rock and Hip Hop. Subconsciously it was all coming out of my movements I really was feeling the music and it got to a point where I was shrieking rhythmically to a song and people had to snap me out of it. Afterwards I had some of the toughest people in the bar giving me props it was an odd feeling It was both enjoyable but also I felt bad for enjoying it. Even though I didn&#39;t hurt anyone I am ashamed that people had to see that other side of me it was downright primal. After it was all said and done me and the KJ made up I could tell he was trying to smooth things over the best way he could. He and I are very passionate about music and he gave me an outlet that night I  just hope my friend&#39;s can still look at me the same after that arrogant display.

The worst bullies are the false self righteous. The cryers pointing at injustice where it is not. Bitterness at someone or some group for doing better when you have the same opportunities as them, yet you chose not to pursue because of fear or laziness. But you want what they have, you just dont want to work for it so you demonize them. People that do this are the true bullies and truly practicing wickedness.
Absolutely. I.look at the critisizms that are levied against our country(U.S.A) by some people and ..ok..yes alot of bad things have happened and I do think weve been lied to about reasons for war and society is more and more manipulated by central powers that have access to all these tools to provide themselves more control,...although I think its more like a powerful few who are responsible but we all have the capability.....but that being said..I have this warm bed, and a roof, and even the poorest in America can eat everyday and have clean water...and have access to better their situation and get help. There are so many things to be greatful for. Espescially here in the U.S. and in this life.
I learned from being hurt that sometimes you need to let the monster out of the cage.
Clean your room.  It all starts there.
I think of men in trenches and when they were scared to climb over the top in fear of death.  THEIRS. They were shot by their own Masonic traitors officer&#39;s.  Those men who pulled the trigger. I dont ever want to be that &quot;man&quot;.
...in deed!
Haha, oh my, this guy has so many personal problems, and you all suck on his megalomaniac teat. Hard life he has had so inspirational buahahaha.üòÇ
Thumbs Down just for the thumbnail üòä
Feed your light side, not your dark side.
Treat yourself like you&#39;re someone that is responsible for helping . You learn more when you talk least .  As you&#39;ve always said make friends with those that want the best for you . A new broom sweeps clean an old broom knows the corners .
Man I would pay to hear this lecture. Not the lecture everyone wants me to hear
the reaper has saved me
Love this man please keep up the good work
Great talk, except for the fact that Peterstein always has to relate morality back to WW2 and the Holocaust every single time. Get a new trope, man",PT8M24S

I feel sad for those who don‚Äôt have the patience to  listen to this because it‚Äôs too long or there are too many words that mean nothing to them. <br>Dr Petersen is one of our time‚Äôs greatest thinkers. His detractors are offended because he speaks truth and common sense. The second dialogue is no less profound and truthful.
I need to listen to this every day I wish I had someone to talk to I&#39;m in a tremendous way i give everything away I believe I was meant to hear this today I&#39;ve been away from the light for to long
What is the speech in chapter two?! I‚Äôve been trying to find out please someone tell me the sauceee

Is it just me or did anyone see the joker smile for the thumbnail?üòÇ
my problem is weed .... i wanna be a truck driver and improve my life but damn i cant quit
Actually it makes a lot of sense. We human beings fix every single things which are broken so that we can use it for our benifit but what about our own broken lifes? Who will repair it? God? Mom? Dad? No its us.

interesting
i repeated this video more than once, it&#39;s a very cool video.
where are the fallout stats from the thumbnail?
Why should I even improve my self
I think you dont even need to ask why you shoud improve in the first piace, the point is to have the will and the discipline to keep yourself costant
Is it just me or at first glance did anyone else also see the microphone he&#39;s wearing on the thumbnail as heath ledger&#39;s joker smile scars.. I got confused af fr.. üòÇüòÇ.. Jokes apart this guy is a legend of wisdom in the modern world.. Respect..üíØüíØ
Didnt he talk about Sneed Feed and Seed
One thing I find annoying is that he is extremely verbose. If something can be put forth in 10-20 simple words, he would use 90-100 complicated words. The message sometimes is quite simple, but with his big vocabulary and deep knowledge, it‚Äôs easy to zone out or even lose the impact that the message would otherwise have on you
The Kingdom is within, uhh.
Now is now with me over you....
Which hume text is he referring to, about organising yourself first and then extending yourself?
wheres the fallout
Thanks jorden uncle
Your speech your branding everything on me and not on that blaming stuff  NO the question is why
I love this take
&quot;The world will be a better place without me in it&quot;<br>Well maybe, but it will certainly be a much better place if you were to become a better person<br>edit: just an idea
Yes. Life really is mostly about the routines. The daily commute I have to go to univ, the daily night routine before I go to bed, the daily classes I have.<br>If I don&#39;t find it enjoyable, I might find my life sucks.

You need to improved yourself because you don&#39;t suffer anymore stupidly than you have to. Thats the key word. Most times it amazes me greatly how I moved from an average lifestyle to earning over $63k per month, Utter shock is the word. I have understood a lot in the past few years that there are lots of opportunities in the financial market. The only thing is to know where to invest.

Investment in stocks is a great way to invest your money. The team is constantly checking the market for changes and make sure that you are always informed about the best time to invest. As a result, I have made more money than ever before, and I don&#39;t have to manage my portfolio on my own! Invest in stocks, it&#39;s worth it!
The most important thing that should be on everyone&#39;s mind currently should be to invest in different sources of income that doesn&#39;t depend on the government. Especially with the current economic crisis around the word. This is still a good time to invest in various stocks, Gold, silver and digital currencies.
The problem is consistency, please help
&quot;Rats are so afraid of cats that they don&#39;t even need to see a cat&quot;

Imagine if more psychologists broke things down like this instead of asking you dumb questions and then perpetuating the same line of questioning

#JordanPeterson #motivation2study #motivation #studymotivation",25130,781,26,2023-05-29T03:00:01Z,"Jordan Peterson is a Positively Inspirational Motivating Person
I think it was about time I grew up and have a change of heart. Jordan Peterson helped me when I first encountered him now 5 years ago, and I loved his courses. But I turned my back on him when I saw that he did not agree with feminism, climate change, or race and gender studies. Everything that I stood for. Or veganism for that matter. I will die a leftist, if not even radical. I left some comments a while ago insulting Peterson, and being judgemental. I would like to apologize. Peterson was the first intellectual I listened to for pure pleasure, and I feel ashamed I treated him like this. Even though I think many times the problem is the system, I do think now it is also up to the individual‚Äôs responsibility. Maybe we can be who we wanna be and overcome our circumstances. Who knows? Responsibility. I am growing old and I long for a more balanced view. I think Peterson should not be censured. We need a plurality of thinkers and viewpoints. I still think Peterson should read more about the bonobos so that he can understand better sexuality, and to understand that it is actually natural. I still am shocked by what he said about Putin and leftists. But I think Peterson is a victim. He should not have been kicked out of university and other restrictions. It has gone a bit too far. It was his lifetime work. And I am sorry he reached that point. Peterson is a man far more intelligent than I am, and yet I have insulted him and treated him badly. I would like to apologize. I am sorry we live in a world where people cannot have important conversations without starting to hate one another. Although I dream of a very multicultural world, I can understand why some want to preserve the old one. I want to apologize for the childish behavior that I so regret now. It is not nice to mob people. I think Peterson should be a professor again.

At this moment, it is crucial for individuals to prioritize investing in alternative streams of income that are not reliant on the government, particularly with the existing worldwide economic crisis. Investing in stocks, gold, silver, and digital currencies can still be profitable during this period. Therefore, it is advisable to explore these investment options to secure one&#39;s financial future.
this is misleading and not motivational üò¢

I have been trying to get a hold of Jordan Peterson for 5 years at september now. How do people get in contact with him? I&#39;m willing to pay for it also. is there any way?
shit advice lol once the word DONT is use in any sentence  then you in trouble
OMG anyone reading this is you do nothing else as a young person PLZ read my words. I went from a bad ass at 20 to a 48:year old guy that will likely die alone 2 failed marriages but thankfully fabulous daughter and grandkids. My childhood was so horrible I was in pure survival mode from 12 on and I never could think long term ever because it was all I could do to stay in the now and try and be a family from 16 on. My point is DONT miss the forest for the trees. My 1st marriage was trash for both of us I was living with her at 15 but my 2nd marriage I met the perfect human being and I couldn&#39;t freaking deal with the struggles that came with her and her amazing daughter. I held myself to such a standard I just shaf on myself for every little mistake because I knew how precious and rare what I had was I never could breathe and live....so we all lost sadly.
The client  not the patient.  Says a lot to me. Ask a psychologist if they treat a patient in a generic way. This phony does! No exchanges between him and the people he&#39;s treating. Just about his views of what means what.  This is a dangerous person in terms of leadering people astray. Crudely, he fu*ks with people&#39;s minds. Be careful

To withdraw with no medical intervention
And Christina , most importantly it is life threatening to withdraw  from alcohol when the body is addicted. Don&#39;t let anyone , even yourself , believe that doing this is positive .it is very very dangerous .I hope you are ok
Please Christina you are describing alcohol withdrawal, you can&#39;t do this without medical support .Any hospital has a duty of care to stabilise and detox you and connect you to counselling after if you want that .Withdrawal is the first step . God bless you , bless you for wanting and trying to stop drinking . Get the support you deserve , don&#39;t take no for an answer at hospital as it can be a long wait for private detox . I hope your ok

Life sucks, then ya die.  I&#39;m just hoping my death comes soon.  It&#39;s not worth it to keep going anymore.  I&#39;ve lost most of everything I love.  I am alone.  Widowed.  No body wants me except ones no one wants.  I can&#39;t find anyone of quality that even comes close to matching the brilliant star that I lost.  I refuse to just settle because I&#39;m worth more than that.  I just want to quit n die.  Gotta make sure my youngest kid makes it to 18 first.  Then screw it,  I&#39;m pulling the trigger on myself.

The best thing for depression is to STOP LISTENING TO KOOKS WHO SPREAD DISINFORMATION.
Is he psychologic? No , so shut your mouth up cuz being depressed means you have no reason to continue your life , so get a job for what ?
This man is awful. Great advice mixed with judgemental ideals. He is just a sophisticated Andrew Tate
JP is one of the most important voices of our time!
this needs to be taught in early teens..
What sould we need to do when we are feeling dead inside and no energy and motivation to persue what has been suggested?
You&#39;re an angel in this life, thank you
So I missed the advice in this.
The very beginning, you have no understanding what actual depression feels like. Doesn&#39;t matter ,you got 30k likes.
Lost my daughter. Diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. Depression. <br><br><br>I‚Äôm fighting like Mike Tyson ‚ù£Ô∏èüî•
Most Americans hate their jobs.  The feel it&#39;s meaningless at best.  So when your job just makes you even more depressed,  now what
If this is helpful, you aren&#39;t depressed
I watch you every now and then I start a new job tomorrow because I had 3 systems of what you coached in this video . Thank you. Watched your videos but today I listened.
Depression is Hell on Earth, Sir.
Old irrelevant senior here. 77, not fit enough to work a gig. Suicide is my religion‚Äôs UNFORGIVABLE SIN. Jesus gave us a preview of death. So, we need to gear up for the moment. Healthy til old. So, my mom would have said‚Äùstop the pity party!‚Äù She was right. Just it is what it is.
Yep I&#39;m gonna die.
Thank you so much, Jordan. I really needed to hear that.
This was so painful to watch for someone who has been suffering from depression for a long time, chronic knee pain and weak immunity. <br><br>No job. No intimate relationships...<br><br>Like my insides have been crying, &quot;help me, anyone, someone,please, save me&quot; for the longest time...
Depression is a choice Happiness is a Lie
If you don&#39;t have a job do volunteer work so you can have somewhat of a schedule.
No job, little older than you, perfect storm left me in fear of failure.   The living as is won&#39;t last much longer.  No friends.   Reclused.
Life can be meaningful enough to justify it&#39;s suffering --- The best thing i have heard this year . Thank you JPü•∫
uhhh. no im so much happier since quitting my job it was killing me, its still hard now but atleast im still here, if i didnt leave that job i dont know that i would be.
31, have a job, have a relationship, but past mistakes haunt me. I had an abortion with my ex gf when we were 21 &amp; 22 - I can‚Äôt get over this loss. It sticks with you, I can‚Äôt get rid of the guilt, the remorse, the feelings of emptiness at what could have been and who that child might be today. I don‚Äôt think I can recover from this.
I have everything a man could want. A very beautiful wife who loves me dearly. A group of friends who love me dearly. A business that is doing well, a house, nice cars, toys, etc. Yet, i feel sadness almost constantly. Sure, i have been put on my knees by life and it is hard to get back up but this feeling of sadness has been with me most of my life. I can‚Äôt understand where it comes from and i don‚Äôt know how to beat it.
How to stop depression?  Stop listening to idiots.  Start with Jordan Petersen.
The minute he started sayng people on phd&#39;s get depressed he lost me. Thats like 1% of the people with phds who are depressed. This video is a no go for the general public depression.
Having a job is the trigger that sends me into a downward spiral! <br>I was alright before the stark reality of adulthood and responsibility hit. Lol!  Office bitches and low staff morale is what chips away at my self esteem and sends everything grey. There&#39;s only 2 places I worked that was 80% tolerable, but one was only temporary and the other closed with redundancies.
I suffered from severe clinical depression 31 years ago. The scary thing about depression is that one doesn&#39;t know one&#39;s depressed until he/she is in it right over his/her head.  I thought i was going crazy with the mood swings, like swinging on a pendulum back and forth from rage to guilt, then back and gorth.  Thank God that I went for professional help when I did.  <br>I&#39;m turning 70 years soon.
completed my biotech degree but 2 years after that i have done nothing in my life and i feel lost now ,head filled with suicidal thoughts just dont know what should i do
BRILLIANT SIMPLY BRILLIANT! Thank you!
what isnt right is my height, 5ft3 male, no talent or academic competency. So basically no real room for financial growth to the desired amount i need to make up for being 5ft 3. I could just enjoy life for the moments worth being alive for once a couple of months or so, or I should kms because I&#39;m never gonna get what I want in life, a girl who chose me as their first choice.
Stupidest advice ever to take psych meds, even if you&#39;re contemplating suicide, bcuz taking them very often leads to suicide.  Presription meds or any drug may temporarily block pain and block emotions, but the side effects are not worth it, not only bcuz they are addictive, but also bcuz they will make you feel co-dependent, like you can&#39;t function without them, which is a lie.  In the long run, they do cause brain damage and will make you more disassociated, i.e. less able to confront your life and less able to take the positive actions required to survive well.<br>Jordan should update this old   video bcuz he knows that recently taking benzo psych meds very nearly killed him.
&quot;Find some friends. Get out on the dating circuit&quot; in other words subject yourself to constant ridicule so you become immune to it?
I‚Äôm so tired
watch this video when you DON&#39;T FEEL DEPRESSED. Peterson seems like he has absolutely no idea what depression is and how the fundamental problem is that you just are unable to DO what you set out to do. But imagine that you are watching this video and you are in your good phase. Then, perhaps you will find the strength to make some of the 3 basic changes he suggests.
This was Jordan at his best.  Every word of this is true.
Sometimes suicide isn&#39;t about depression. I just don&#39;t want to be here anymore.
Many people that were and are indoctrinated by religion ... in the desperate search to find contentment ...  suffer from depression.<br><br>There are now hundreds of ex members of clergy that have joined The Clergy Project, to in turn find employment elsewhere.<br><br>From Apostle to Apostate: The Story of the Clergy Project ‚Ä¶ authors ‚Ä¶ Catherine Dunphy, Richard Dawkins<br><br>Leaving a job in ministry is unlike any other career change. Not only are there feelings of isolation, but there are also fears about how to communicate one‚Äôs skills in ministry to another Job. Most members who had already left church work detailed a long arduous journey to find employment outside of religion. Many, if not most, of them returned to school, seeking degrees in psychology, social work, business administration, and computer science.
It should be &#39;Stop listening to me&#39; ... I just heard three words so far ... that is enough ... bye!
I would really like people to stop letting this very simple man, stop being a thing. Please stop this basic bullshit.
I agree on the job. I‚Äôm 74 and work 12 hours a week. Gives me spending money and have money to pay for things that break, which they eventually do owning a home. Wish I had a horse again. They were my escape.
When your life is in such good order that Jordan&#39;s advice is redundant, and yet you experience the full force of depression - that&#39;s the issue.<br>The issue is not that life is bad so you feel bad (i.e. a normal response).
Nearly 80, get a job?
I really needed that
when I listen to you, adds propose me videos of Michelle obama !! How pervert is this algorithm !!
Umm . . . where&#39;s the genius advice?
Ppl that smoke pot are very unmotivated / lazy to get a job arent they ??  and get into foul moods ??  Although they can become creative  ??
would poo my pants,but would cool to dare jordan to take an impossible person,but that queue is probably same lenght as to God",PT10M52S

It&#39;s good to study about brain very important to have healthy relationship worldly people don&#39;t know how to handle situation leaders also are in darkness and teach Bible for selfish need to earn money to get famous to become rich want miracle nobody is in search of God and those who are in love of God people hate for they don&#39;t understand Bible devil gives wrong message for they have pride in them that they got wisdom to encourage one another that&#39;s the way you solve problems about them Dr Jordan Peterson you have gift from God hope people learn from you for they don&#39;t understand word of God and hate word of God got mantel problem if good person get join to those who got wrong mentality gets intoxication i have experienced when I was in rehabilitation and how they got better after speaking with me but then problem become every body wanted to meet me only to meet me was making idea and wait for me i feel very sad worldly people don&#39;t understand i had to stay in room by closing door all alone so many got well and was gone home may be for short time but i thank God for making me to get intouch with you i thank God for you one body different parts in Christ people don&#39;t understand you Dr Jordan Peterson they think that you are against creator you are not you are working for God i  am happy for you
I learned some more about the brain....but how to get over a breakup fast....not so much.
The name of your channel is a joke. Since you‚Äôre Using someone else‚Äôs reputation for your gain. That is shameless you need help the only God can give you. Beg for Mercy when he comes for you.
Intolerable number of commercials
There is no information on getting over a break up fast. Most channels that post Jordan Petersons videos are this way, it does not follow through on the title of the video and only certain aspects are provided, mostly out of context which will lead to more confusion and less help/assistance.
Ok, so what&#39;s the bottomline? I didn&#39;t get it.
did you suddenly stop following your daughter on the &quot;onlyfans?&quot;<br>asking for a friend. he wants to know if he can get on line now.

Jordan Peterson REVEALS Details About His Meat Only Diet..,"Jordan Peterson REVEALS Details About His Meat Only Diet..

Welcome back to Pursuit Of Meaning. In 2018, Peterson stopped eating everything apart from beef, salt and water. To clarify, he doesn't eat chicken or lamb or pork. He eats beef. Exclusively. It all started with Peterson's daughter, Mikhaila. The now 30-year-old grew up with a number of health conditions that she says severely affected her quality of life. On her website, Mikhaila writes that she was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis when she was seven, and diagnosed with depression at 12. At 14, she experienced debilitating fatigue and at 17, had her hip and ankle joints replaced because of arthritis. 

In 2015, she started an elimination diet. The idea of an elimination diet is to remove foods that might be causing uncomfortable symptoms and slowly reintroduce them, therefore ruling out foods that aren't tolerated well. After removing ""most foods"" from her diet, Mikhaila found her fatigue and depression lifted. Throughout this period, her well-known father had started an elimination diet after seeing the impact it had on Mikhaila. By April 2018, he went on the 'lion diet' (salt, water and meat), and found it cured his depression, anxiety, GERD, fatigue, psoriasis, floaters in his right eye, and gum disease. In July of that year, Jordan Peterson appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience - a podcast that at the time had over 100 million downloads a month, and has continued to grow. Peterson explained how watching Mikhaila's health transformation had encouraged him to change his diet, ultimately leading him to cut out everything except meat.

Definitely someone stupid vegan a***ole because he doesn&#39;t seem to support it cuz this is something that&#39;s taking over the world and helping people a lot.

Dr. Peterson please sir .....contact Dr. Joe Dispenza you have everything to gain and nothing to lose.....I don&#39;t know how likely you are to do this but I believe it will do you well....
Meat diets cause cancer, everyone knows that
I‚Äôm 74, been on carnivore for over two months along with my husband and it‚Äôs strengthened our knees, we‚Äôve lost weight, feeling better in many ways. So grateful our daughter told us about it.
I am 8 weeks in carnivore, had to introduce some low oxalates fruits, lost weight that I shouldn‚Äôt but I am happy cause all my body aches and arthritis is the neck pinching my shoulder for months now gone! Also I used to have degenerative disc problems I am in the recovery but I am doing amazing, body feels great! It‚Äôs the best diet for humans that are in this planet, cause raises your body vibrations making so energetic!
I‚Äôm on all meat diet I feel better than I have in years and I‚Äôm only a month in to my 90 day diet, I‚Äôve already lost over 15 lbs of fat
The truth is that the establishment has been pushing carbs and carbohydrates to humanity and it simply led to all sorts of degenerative diseases, while everybody going strict on the carnivore diet omitting dairy, fibers, sugars, caffeine and all sorts of processed foods have seen a turn of events.<br><br>The establishment falling apart began quite some time ago with their wars, political affairs, the banking system, the madness of its entertainment industry and now everybody knows their vegan agenda is crumbling.<br><br>The carnivore diet is a tickling bomb that will spread across the world, and by being healthy again the people will take the power back from these malicious people who seek our lives for no fucking reason other than feeling better because everybody else is suffering. Fuck the establishment.<br><br>Eat grass fed beef as it should always have been, only that for 7 days of your life, eat as much as you want and can so that you are satiated, cut everything else, from caffeine to sugar, just one fucking week out of your life and see how you feel. The truth can only be experienced, there is no place for debate. <br><br>It doesn‚Äôt matter what so called scientists and doctors say, if someone says something it needs to be proven, and the only to prove something is to put it to the test, and so if the outcome doesn‚Äôt match the claim, then the claim was false. All those who went into the strict carnivore diet without cheating have only seen benefits on all sides in terms of their health and well being. <br><br>Vegans can get fucking lost, if eating plants make people stumble they have the right to eat what makes them feel better or even great, so fuck the vegans if people reversed their health problems on the carnivore diet, and it has been proven again and again by thousands of testimonies that are being shut down and hidden by the establishment, they don‚Äôt want people to know the truth, keep eating your sheet food that don‚Äôt have any nutrients and for the most aggressive ones out there who want to impeach others to eat what they need to keep being healthy and lead better lives we will remember you when you want to make the switch realising you were wrong the whole time. I‚Äôm certainly not going to forgive anyone who tried to either prevent me from eating meat or those who try to ban it.<br><br>Imagine, some people are doing all they can to ban meat for us to consume, some evil basterds even go about making patty steaks made out of plants only which carry no vitamins and nutrients that meat from animals provide, needless to say the hypocrisy of vegans is just over the top when all these mfs claim eating plants is better for the environment importing avocados year round full of pesticides, eating their sheet cereals, their gluten and fibres so damaging to the gut lining as well as being slow poisoning of the cells, eating their cupcakes, their fucking McDonalds and junkfood produced by Monsanto and alike. Oh and don‚Äôt you love to hear how we gotta protect the animals by stopping to raise them and care for their survival and reproduction ? See it‚Äôs the opposite, if people stop raising cattle they will go extinct, because they need us for protection and care in order to survive, they cannot live on their own in the wild, so who‚Äôs actually the protector of animals ? Those that listen to God and who know that God gave us a very specific list of foods which we can consume, ruminants who have a divided hoof and chew the cud, and then seafood which has fins and scales only, nothing else you dumb phhuks.<br>I think all vegans should just be sent to the Amazonian forest and eat whatever they want there, that way we would be rid of some serious degenerates for good.<br>Ultimately it‚Äôs gonna come down to this two various group, of those that think we should only be eating plants and those who stick to the word of God, but the issue of the time being that it‚Äôs so mixed into the population that making studies is complicated, but as so many testimonies point out, vegans suffer depression, chronic diseases, lack of vitamin d and all sorts of mental degenerative issues, it‚Äôs clearly the toxins contained within the biology of plants that are in cause of all kinds of diseases.<br><br>Long live to beef, not our God, but surely the king of food the Lord has given us, thank you Lord God, your word and your wisdom is trust worthy üôèüèª
He started it AFTER his daughter mikhaila  had awsome results on it , after years of being very  very sick. ......Get your facts straight !!!!      She has told her story on youtube also . Look her up , as she has a very interesting story.
It&#39;s definitely a do. I&#39;ve been eating carnivore for a year and a half. The reason why I started was because I wanted to get rid of my severe migraines, stomach pains, irregular bowel movement, gourds and acid reflux. I believe by having eaten only meat now for a year and a half has helped get rid of my medical problems.. Soon as I start eating anything else I get all my symptoms back and I now know that Eating carnivore is a much better option for me.
It seems hard to cut out so many bad habits, but starting with no processed sugars less alcohol(low cal only) no bread potato,  pasta or rice. Fruit is high in natural sugar so I use as a treat or pick me up after or before exercise .  No high cal food before bed and no coffee after 4pm . I do like my coffee . Sometimes drinking chocolate as a sweetener is still better than adding straight old sugar .
Almost killed himself. What a moron. üòÇüòÇ
This diet is for sure a do, if you suffer from some form of chronic pains
Do
I just started, tell you when I know.
The tagline is so deceptive.  It makes it seem like the beef diet almost killed him, when the truth is exactly the opposite- eating beef saved him.
man, this video just draws u, but with nothing to learn at the end.  just straight up babble.
This is a BS video. Total crap
To get technical, this is not the Jordan Peterson diet, but the Carnivore diet. There are other people who have eaten like this for 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 years.<br><br>I have been carnivore for 15 months now, and made tremendous progress. There are thousands of testimonies like mine. I only eat meat and drink water.
It‚Äôs a Do all the way!  Standard American Diet has made for millions of sick people.  Also, makes us FAT!
Jack Gilbert is full of excrement and being ‚Äúsensitized‚Äù to non carnivore foods means your body is no longer used to you putting poison into your digestive system.
OMG!!! So if we follow this diet, we will miss snacking and coffee shops, we may loose weight and - more importantly- we will develop low tolerance to the toxins and high sugars if the American diet!!!! I am not a carnivore yet, but a little perspective here‚Ä¶
I&#39;m wondering how the content creator behind this video feels about all of these comments in his comment section? Because I certainly was picking up quite a bit of hostility towards people &quot;eating animals&quot;.
Just because they say they are experts, proofs in the pudding!!! Jordan and his daughter have valuable testimonies to the outcomes!!!!! That‚Äôs what matters, not opinions by those that prove out to financially benefit by the public‚Äôs na√Øvety!
lmao what a disingenuous ending, there&#39;s more to it than that but in extremely short format; yes, it maks you more sensitive to the toxins in the industrial food.
If main stream fake media says : go vegan....dont do it....Go and eat more red meat....no carbs, sugar....
Telling people you or they can get scurvy from eating meat only diet  is absolute TOTAL BS.  <br>you CANNOT get scurvy from a meat diet. EVER. Napoleons army  CURED  scurvy with giving their soldiers meat. <br>a Well Known historic FACT and the VERY REASON all health historians have recorded it. <br>Doctors who dont read medical history are just bad doctors.
Been carnivore for 6 years. Lost diabetes, hbp,A fib, colon cancer, &amp; 102 lbs. Know a woman in Canada that has been on carnivore diet for 65 years. She looks 35 and she&#39;s 86 and still runs her cow farm!!üëçüòäüôèü•ìü•öü•©ü§†üí™
I just know that Chinese, when they wanted to get rid of an inmate, put him on all meat diet. He died in few months due to acidity of body and dead intestinal microbiom.

My friends pops been on this diet for like 20 years. He&#39;s in the better shape than a good amount of 25 year olds at 55 lol. Perfect health across the board
I love Jordan. Lol you obviously don&#39;t understand the benefits üòÇ
We are not lions Peterson loses credibility when saying he lost this diet due to cutting out everything but meat. What caused the weight loss was consuming significantly less calories as a result of cutting out other food sources‚Ä¶he claims to know so much about human anatomy and biology based on his comments about trans people but negated the fact that carbs and fats are an essential part of the human diet. Some of our organs and hormones can‚Äôt function properly without them.
You can chose to eat whatever you want, just be ready for the consequences of your own actions. There is no escape from that! So be careful what you chose!!! I always go for rigorous scientific evidence.
5.5 ys on this diet and will never fo back.
This diet is no snake oil. It HAS sent my auto immune condition into remission.
Man this video just seems like you‚Äôre trying to dis the carnivore diet by saying misleading comments without any proof.
dairy and eggs worse u can eat
Cnn just reported red meat and Suger giving the young Cancer...lol...
Y‚Äôall are stupid. Meat dairy and egg industry is worried about their future, so they cooked up a bullshit story about how processed meat full of cholesterol, excessive iron and hormones are good for you
sounds like mold exposure for both
Lol, Jack Gilbert needs to learn a bit more about physiology.
I&#39;ll go listen to him myself.   2 min was nuff
Eggs, butter and bacon for breakfast?? Sign me up!! üòäüòä
This is the best I have felt my entire life.
BS. This video is fake news
I eat a well balanced diet,  I fixed all my issues simply by eliminating processed foods and wheat.  I still get about 200-230 carbs a day with sweet potatoes, fruits and root vegetables without lectin and vegetables with low lectin after cooking and to specifically point out Avocado.  My point is, find what foods you have trouble with and eat as balanced as you can.  Carnivores will site the fructose study and fail to point out they gave rats fructose and glucose not whole foods with fiber and additional nutrients.",PT8M28S

isn&#39;t arrogants always making things worse... i think it is, because to be &quot;above it&quot; is something else than arrogance even if it is interpreted as arrogance by the counterpart... isn&#39;t it ?!
Jordan Peterson has been attacking women in all of his videos lately.  I no longer consider him a hero.  You can not bash half of humanity without consequences.
I‚Äôm a cis white man and I used to be so far up the conservative asshole I could tell you what they eat for breakfast (the poor).  I just needed to say that when you said the whole ‚Äúam I a woman because people see me as a woman and did I become a woman when they did? That was like unironically so profound üòÇ
TRiiiiiiiipppyyy! Im reading &quot;12 Rules For...&quot; and I love it!!
I wrote a mean comment that I deleted after I watched your comming out video, and now understand a little bit better where you are comming from. Allow me some questions though: Why do you think, that you can be you only in the role of a female human beeing? Why couldn&#39;t you be you just as you are? A man does not has to be a certain way. A man is just a person in the end. Why the female stereotype? Wouldn&#39;t it be exciting to be a man, a human beeing as you were born and pull this off, without the medical shit? Pardon my ignorance but I feel sorry for you.

As a jazz student, the &#39;meaning is like jazz&#39; bit absolutely killed me. Loved this video
There is no shift in Jordan Peterson ideas : his 2 books are just a summary of his academic book Maps of Meaning. References to phenomenology were already present in his old lessons. Btw JP has no ideology and his ideas are not new, he is just making a summary, but using modern topics, of traditional (and cross-political) western values, staying quite attached to very basic (but everlasting) classic liberalism ideas. What is really surprising is that people actually think that JP is saying something philosophically new and/or weird. He is just quite updated on statistics and psychometric studies, nothing else

This is too much production, I like it.
Wow I was getting into an existential philosophical rabbit hole and then she said &quot;Tree falls in a forest what are it&#39;s pronouns?&quot; and I cracked up.
I think what Jordan Peterson says and his belief is true in it&#39;s own right and merit. Every single one of us make up a big unit like USA government or any other country government. Since the entire unit/system is build upon individual person then if one individual person rots the entire system will go rotten. So in order to hold the entire foundation each of us person first have to get our act rights. Which is very very important message to anyone that is trying to change the world. Because you cannot be the person that cannot change something in his own life then go onto change the world because they will fail miserably. So in my opinion it is very very important to make sure you sort yourself out before you branch out to outside of your community to fix things. I do not see particularly wrong with that line of thinking. Not everyone is trying to change the world. Lot of people are just trying to live their own life and failing at it. I really really love your work and how you present things. I wish you could have Jordan Peterson on your podcast. I see lot of people with bullshit complain or vague complain about him but you seriously criticize him on substance that might actually be true. I love the way you think. We need more of you for sure.",PT35M4S
"Does Dr. Jordan Peterson ""Talk Nonsense""? Matt's Reply",Full Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwSsXmfEvBY&t=2762s,36936,2096,192,2023-06-10T17:26:48Z,"Bless your heart.  I agree.  There is no one person who has all the answers.  Wisdom is never being the smartest person in the room.  I believe Jordan is humble and with wisdom and experience he is naturaly being drawn to our Roman Catholic Doctrine.  It&#39;s the most sincere compliment to Our Church.  The fact that someone with his broad insight that of all the faiths he believe our faith makes the most sense.  I am a cradle Catholic and when my children made their first Communion I finally understood what a gift I had received from my parents.  They raised me from birth to believe in the One true church.  Not everyone comes to have faith.  Some of us are given the gift and don&#39;t recognize it until we suffer.  GOD&#39;S PLAN IS PERFECT.
üòÇ Imagine being so ignorant and arrogant that you believe JBP talks nonsense... <br>Just because you can&#39;t comprehend it doesn&#39;t make it nonsense.
When is the show comming? :o It will be increadable!!
I love Peterson but rather than asking why he isn&#39;t Catholic, I&#39;d rather hear why he believes in a God at all, or if he believes in a God at all. Some people believe because they want to, or because they feel a certain way, but he&#39;s such a strong proponent of objective evidence and data. None of that exists for the divine unfortunately.
Excellent response!
There is a huge split in our thinking in this country and I believe Jordan is trying to help close the gap and bring the 2 sides back together.
Well said Matt. We must meet people where they are at, anything outside of that is rooted in pride. Btw, when is Dr Peterson coming on? Can‚Äôt wait for that!
I don‚Äôt think they just meant convert him when they said he talks nonsense. I respect him on a lot of topics, but others he leans heavily into Carl Jung occultism talk that is wildly unscientific, such as the personality tests that he recommends to people.
Dr. Peterson has expressed some truly goofy, at-times disappointing ideas regarding religion and spirituality (particularly so, when it at all relates the Church), but I think there‚Äôs great worth to his words when he speaks on issues pertinent to his expertise, e.g. psycho-behavioral analysis in relation to one‚Äôs upbringing.
What a fab comment. Wonderful brother<br>üôèüíú‚úùÔ∏è Northern Ireland
I think even if Jordan Peterson somehow decided to talk nonsense on purpose, it would probably take the person who wrote that comment, the catholic interviewer and all of us watching this a couple of lifetimes to even realize he was talking nonsense.
Oh Gawd‚Ä¶.. I live among the Mormons and it is so annoying to be continually surrounded by these self-righteous, high demand ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù. Lay off and mind your own business. We like following different religious content creators, like Matt Fradd; but we don‚Äôt want to ever join the Catholic, or Mormon, or Jehovah‚Äôs Witness churches.
Soooo, when is Jordan Peterson coming on the show tho?
Matt I know about your woman comedians stance, I found this clip funny but can&#39;t say all her material is good <br><a href=""https://youtu.be/Edxr25t8trc"">https://youtu.be/Edxr25t8trc</a>
Jordan Peterson speaks with the carefulness of an academic because they are cattier than any group of middle school mean girls, &amp; he makes sure to be precise &amp; clear with his language. He wants to make sure that anyone who is trying to listen will understand exactly what he‚Äôs trying to express, &amp; he makes sure to add in any detail from an adjacent field of study, period of history, etc. that can add more depth to the conversation. I can understand how it could seem like he‚Äôs spewing arrogant word salad like so many today, but what he‚Äôs really doing is basically editing his speech as he‚Äôs writing an academic, scientific paper for admission into an academic journal. It‚Äôs something he will have be required to learn as a college student, &amp; he‚Äôs been doing for 20 years as a professor in order to write academic papers &amp; to write his classroom lectures. It will be secondhand practice to him like brushing our teeth is to us. With all the lies &amp; attacks against him, he likely has tried to be really sure that he‚Äôs being as precise as humanly possible with his language. We know it doesn‚Äôt matter to his critics because they don‚Äôt care about the truth; they just want to destroy him, but I‚Äôd be more careful in his position too.
Can we retire the word journey
I must admit Jordan‚Äôs lectures never really resonated with me, were always a bit saying so much without ever really saying anything at all to me, however obviously I‚Äôm the complete minority and my opinion means absolutely nothing.<br><br>Wish him all the best in his Journey to Christüôè
I think it comes from scruples. Jordan Peterson has great things to say and very intellectual and can offer advice that can be helpful to you in life. I think people may say he talks nonsense because if its not Catholic they don&#39;t want to take their  advice especially from a intellectual stand point.
I think what they mean is he tends to ramble and give off topic answers
I can&#39;t believe someone would say that about him! What?
Peterson already admitted that he doesn&#39;t believe in God. So it sounds like it will be just another &quot;God is so interesting, and imagine if He did exist. Dude the symbolism!&quot;. Also, what do you mean &quot;so we can say we own him&quot;. Do you think that justifies someone rejecting Jesus Christ? No it doesn&#39;t.
Please, please, please, talk about Solzhenitsyn and Dostoyevsky!
He is Catholic, he just doesn&#39;t know it yet!
I appreciate that conversion is a process, a long and difficult one. However, I must admit I was perplexed with one of JBP  conversations, where the guest claimed that apostles believed because they used psychedelics and JBP seemed to agree. I guess it would calm my heart if someone presented a more conventional version....
Ah, now here&#39;s a delightful thought! If dear Jordan were to embrace the ways of Orthodox Christianity, how might we Catholics react, you reckon? Would we jest, saying, &#39;Oh, what a pity we didn&#39;t get him into the One True Fold of the Redeemer&#39;? Or would we honestly gaze into the mirror, reconsidering our approach to matters of faith and culture? Let&#39;s not get dazzled by his star power, dear Matt! Let&#39;s engage him in a spirited conversation, grilling him thoroughly on both sides of your jolly barbie - with the realms of Orthodoxy and Catholicism as your two fires! As a follower of Jung, we mustn&#39;t let him slip away with Jung&#39;s clever &#39;I don&#39;t need to believe, I know&#39; escape route. No, no, you shall explore his views in all their depths and hold him to account for the implications that follow from his principles, in terms of human acts!
Talk nonsense? Lol. He‚Äôs one of the sanest mainstream public intellectuals out there.
People dont realize how much they say that they dont really believe. Peterson calls people to doubledown and challenges their thought process. Hardly nonsense.
How about JP becoming Christian - a Christ follower - not a Catholic?
Christ is not a catholic,  thus I am not a catholic.
I love learning from Jordon Peterson....
JP is one of the most insightful people
he has his moments üòÇ‚ù§üòÇ
Peterson thinks aloud and admits to all the things he is unsure about. I‚Äôd hardly call that nonsense.
A person who says Dr. Peterson ‚Äútalks nonsense‚Äù is either a fool or has a agenda. Just because someone says stuff you don‚Äôt comprehend doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre talking nonsense.
whenever i hear someone say something like &quot;JP doesn&#39;t makes sense&quot; i can&#39;t help but think they must be a pretty shallow thinker
I find that many people of faith, reduce their belief to a particular meaning for them, and few really embrace with understanding what it truly means to ‚Äúbelieve in God‚Äù or even less, to ‚Äúlove‚Äù God. The implications of understanding  not only who God is but what it means to believe in and love him are terribly frightening, and no one should take on such a claim for themselves whimsically. For the more intellectually oriented, the  task of dying to oneself, to be reborn in Christ becomes all the more daunting, because that death is all the more understood and made ‚Äúreal,‚Äù yet at the same time ever more perplexing and confusing to the mind. But after that leap waits the greatest love and beauty man could ever know, and we see this reflected in the writings of some of the Church‚Äôs greatest saints. St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine pray for us.<br><br>God is working in Jordan Peterson‚Äôs life in the most wonderful way, and for those frustrated by his hesitation, surrender yourselves to God‚Äôs will, commit to prayers of patience and humility, and pray for Jordan Peterson‚Äôs conversion.
Jordan speaks too real and people don&#39;t understand real
Catholic?....let me get something straight....I thought we were all Christian...having one aim....why all this denominations?
Who is this guy or the person asking the question to even comment on jordan Peterson? he‚Äôs straight up doing the lords work bringing millions of people to Jesus with his so-called ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù the guy is literally a modern day prophet, illuminated by god, bringing attention to jesus and the Bible, he helped save my life I thank jesus for his lectures and ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù
If I gave up on people because they weren&#39;t Catholic, I&#39;d have next to no one left in my social circle (including my significant other), only a handful of books left in the house, and only 1 or 2 friends.
Woke hates Jordan Peterson.
so he needs to &quot;grill&quot; him because you don&#39;t like him. this man has helped many men and boys who are lost in this world. what have you ever done to help anyone but yourself?
Agree. He‚Äôs his own person with his own journey.
YES!
JBP talking nonsense is likely due to the fact Peterson talks using science, literature and philosophy, not church Father theology and so people can say he‚Äôs not saying anything when he just makes an Augustinian statement but not quoting Augustine if that makes sense. Peterson brought me back to the faith and for that I will be eternally greatful.
Nonsense?! Dr Peterson is more enlightened on scriptures than most any Protestant that I‚Äôve heard/read. As far as becoming Catholic, there are some serious hurdles that I know I haven‚Äôt been able to fully overcome yet; I have no clue if he feels that way, but dang, he doesn‚Äôt have to become Catholic to be saved.
Peterson‚Äôs take on Genesis 6:9 is terrible.
Jordan B. Peterson knows absolutely everything about everything.<br>With him, we don&#39;t need Jesus to come anymore...
Peterson has his moments but he does tend to ramble on a bit too long at times‚Ä¶like sometimes he will speak for like 15 min and not say anything.
I&#39;ve actually noticed that since his hospitalization his quality has absolutely dropped... And that &quot;conservative manifesto&quot; that he put out was absolutely unintelligible nonsense.",PT52S

Sometimes you have to go socially where every fibre of your being tells you not to just to see the result.
What baffles me is that those who are genuine with good intentions are often stepped on. I grew up in a challenging household, made my way into university and health care but I&#39;ve been defeated so often by the way I&#39;ve been treated by others. It seems to affect me so badly that it&#39;s paralyzing. I&#39;m stuck in some place, so close to my dream, yet stuck because I&#39;ve allowed myself to be defeated by the things that were done and said to me. My relationships have always been a challenge and I&#39;m really just tired of it tbh. I&#39;m not wallowing in self pity but I&#39;m just out of energy and zeal right now. It&#39;s like the life hits where it hurts the most. It&#39;s like you have have sustained some previous injury to a leg but you&#39;re being kicked in that part over and over and over again, the same place.

I was talking to a woman about guys that get put in the&quot;friend zone&quot;.Once you are there, you ain&#39;t nothing but an ATM and a guy that she can get free stuff from.Women will use you like nothing.Yet they will go after the guys who have no loyalty or desire to settle for one woman.Thats when I told her that there is no sympathy for a woman that gets used again and again.She didn&#39;t like that part.
Dr Peterson sharing truth around the world.
Chimps? Medusa? This guy was a professor? At Harvard? Jeez.
Only way to get out the friend zone is not get into the friend zone in the first place. If a female isn‚Äôt physically sexually attracted to you walk away and never look back!
Most people find someone of the same level or mutual benefit. I have turned down many women through my life &amp; they go on to pursue others. Many women are easily seduced, I knew a man who would just got as many women as he could pregnant to spread his genes before disappearing. I don&#39;t think you have experienced much &amp; fell off your pedestal prescribing yourself meds &amp; then having a nervous breakdown without having to face grim realities. You are a narcissist who needs constant validation as your endless, meaningless videos affirm. I am tired of your superficial generalisations dressed up as profundity, but there will always be mindless sheep who need somebody to follow.
Women are trash until they PROVE TO ME OTHERWISE!! I  DON&#39;T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. IM NOT A JOHN ! IVE BEEN SINGLE BY CHOICE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BECAUSE I RATHER WOULD NOT GET SUCKED INTO THE DRAMA AND IM TRYING TO STRENGTHEN MY ABILITY TO NOT GIVE A SHIT!! I PUT WOMEN IN THE FRIENDS ZONE. WHEN THEY GET CONFUSED BY THAT I JUST LET THEM KNOW I WANT ITS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS ME AND THAT WE GET ALONG BEFORE I KID MYSELF ABOUT BEING IN LOVE. BEING IN LOVE IS AN ILLUSION
great clip. Could you please tell me the name of the movie: Crumb is it?
Can someone please explain what the pint of this is? It doesn&#39;t even reach a conclusion. It&#39;s just tangents...
Most women these days are just a bunch of narcissistic cumdumpsters. Don&#39;t treat them otherwise. Put it in, take it out, move on without blinking.
And the fool with no self esteem We&#39;ll still take her out and buy her stuff and hope that she would change her mind!
Thank you .
The captions on this video are really just beyond unforgivable. &quot;Edible complex&quot;? Really???
Title: let‚Äôs shag hard and all night long<br>Video itself: ok let‚Äôs just talk and talk and stay friends
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyTB-AugMDk&amp;t=0m22s"">0:22</a>  YES, EXACTLY.  You should see &#39;friendship&#39; from a woman as a form of her insulting your worthiness as a man to gave your lineage continue - in other words, friendzone means &#39;your line ends here&#39; as a brutal judgement of your worthiness as a man.  It has nothing to do with &#39;I&#39;m not attracted to you &#39;.
Getting friendzoned should not be an issue to anybody..if it happens to you then it&#39;s simply not meant to be with that person,and something far better than that could ever be awaits...
Her: wanna hang out one on one?<br>Me: okay<br>Her: just as friends tho<br>Me: NM Im playing Counter Strike tonight<br>Her: üòÆ
If you get friendzoned don&#39;t even be friends. Experience this a lot &quot;I just see you as a friend&quot;. In other words just a convenience, cut all contact iv found it works for me. Out of sight out of mind.
Is Jordan talking about the movie Crumb from 1994?
Mr. Peterson.   Peak at Romans 7:15-20.   It‚Äôs our nature but we are called to battle it not through our strength but by weakness through Christ.  A concept I engage in continuously.
MEN in England are not capable at having communication with woman. It is extremely rare to have any conversation with any English male.
It us interesting but where or how do I get the complete version of your talk?
This woman‚Äôs everywhere
Sometimes I wonder whether a woman&#39;s desire for a man isn&#39;t based on the individual attractiveness of the man, but rather on the attractiveness of the man respective to the entire male gender. I wonder whether the majority of women don&#39;t just always chase the 15% (or whatever that exact number may be) most attractive males, regardless of how attractive they are considered to be. So I hypothesise that even if the entire male gender improves themselves, that still only the top 15% of males will be considered attractive to women. So in short, I theorise that a man&#39;s attractiveness isn&#39;t absolute, but is relative to the attractiveness of the other males.
Thats good and all but what does this title have to do with  anything except clickbaiting the audience?
Funnily there are only men talking here. You still need to get to know some one better before you can decide that you want something serious with them, don&#39;t you? If then you know and she still doesn&#39;t want to be with you, you can still cancel on her. But give yourselves some time to know each other as well üòÖ
Erm he doesnt talk about NEVER Get Friend Zoned AGAIN! for a Second.<br>Fucking Clickbait again.
I am so afraid of rejection by women that i did not approach them since the age of 18 and i am 40 now.
Finally
I dont mind being friend zoned. Female friends are just as important as male ones. Besides she is likely to have other female friends that she will introduce you to and one of them may be really into you and want to be more than friends. There is an advantage to being friends first. You get to know the person and kind of know what you would be getting into. Rather than some stranger at a bar that you hooked up with cause you &quot;got game&quot;. And after a few dates find out they are a total psycho. In fact sometimes that is why a woman will friend zone you. She wants to feel you out and see what kind of person you are. Because she already has a friend in mind that she thinks will be a better fit. But she wants to know she isnt hooking her friend up with a psycho. Being friend zoned isnt always a bad thing. The woman i have been with the past 18 years i met through a mutual friend. I didnt go find her up in the club. Our mutual friend started bringing her over to hang out with me and my dad. We hit it off and have been together ever since. I love my stella. I wouldnt give her up to save my own life.
Yeah, so picky I had a woman back in the days that friendzone me, for a fit pushover. That finally mistreated her, gave her 2 kids, not taking care of them. And now they want the friend back as a replacement father to raise kids not of their own.  It is sad for all party.  Not sure how many time that occur in the world, but if I experience it, it is probably something that is not unique.   I&#39;m a prick maybe, but I will not raise somebody else kids.
once a dated a girl, she was beautyful, but at every oportunity she had she stated: we are friends with benefts and will never be more than that, and just until i decide to have a relationship with someone<br><br>i liked her, so accepted these terms, but she always stated how she was priviledging me, that she prefered to just be friends, and that annoyed me the hell up, one day we were drunk and started a discussion were a said:<br><br>&quot;decid now, no coming back, do you prefer to be just friends, with nothing more, or do you want to have relationship with me?&quot;<br><br>she felt i was so enchanted by her and that i were such a loser that no other girl would have me, then chose &quot;Just friends&quot;, i said ok,<br><br>no more complaining, but she forget something, if i was such a loser, why she loved so much to talk with me, to pass time with me, to share everything with me, her fears, her dreams, if she invested all of this in me i thought &quot;well, it just didnt work with her, i will try with another girl&quot;<br><br>than this anoter girl, beautyful and smart too, had an instant crush with me, things were amazing, the first girl saw we two kissing at a party and had a melt down, and meet up with to say she wanted me back, but i said &quot;i dont like you anymore, i did it to be just your friend like you said... but well... the sex were always great&quot;<br><br>ahahahha so we meet up casually for sex, but i never could felt respect for her again<br><br><br><br><br>for someone reading this, if you feel in the friend zone, remember, if you are such a loser, why this girl expent so much time with you? something in you is fun, warming, just take this to another person who will appreciate you more
Eh the friend zone is a good thing but how people react to it is what makes it bad, guys that try to change the women that friend zoned them are the same as the girls that try to be with and change their bad boys in the end it&#39;s wasting energy and effort.  <br><br>The problem is we&#39;re not happy with ourselves, and many people confuse having things with doing better but more often than not having more things just means more trouble having companionship does not erase your problems it might even add a few more issues. Sure Amanda loves you to death and she throws it back good, but she&#39;s not always there like you thought and you learn about diabetic medicines and stuffs along with dealing with her issues also it&#39;s not easy and you still have problems to contend with yourself.
Who get really screwed? <br>The person &quot;friendzoning&quot; the other person? <br>Or the other one prentending to be &quot;friend&quot; when they only want to bed the person? <br><br>You don&#39;t want to be friendzone? Well be upfront from the begining! If you&#39;re not then you only have to blame yourself for being in this situation... I would feel betrayed if I realise someone I consider as my friend just played along and only wanted to bed me. Terrible feeling and manipulative tbh.
Even being friend zoned would be a step up for me. I can&#39;t even get a woman to wave to me. I mean seriously, I sit there and wave at them with a big smile on my face for 10 minutes straight and they just look at me weird and tell their kids to stay close. Then their husband comes over and asks if I have a problem. It hurts my feelings
You suck Jordan P.  For real, you use big words and a passionate delivery but the shit you say ‚Äî it‚Äôs just so far off from reality..
sometimes i just wonder why this guy is popular..i feel most of the time he is just talking and talking without saying anything
so, how to NEVER Get Friend Zoned AGAIN??
It&#39;s safe in the friend zone. Get me a truck &amp; a dog, we out. Skate out to the wilderness.
Steps unclear. Everyone is now avoiding me.

What do you call, getting friend zoned in a Marriage?üéäüòÖ
I really like and respect JP but I don&#39;t agree with him on his argument that women are nature&#39;s ultimate reproductive selector. Two reasons come to mind:<br>First, Men make choices on women as prospective partners every single day. Men can reject too, and can also act as nature&#39;s selector.<br>Second, Men, if they are that driven to reproduce themselves, can through a variety of means do so in today&#39;s modern age (e.g. donation being one)
The shots of nature reminded me of Death Stranding and wow.
what a very informative video<br><br>literally nothing related to title xd
In my experience,  friendships, and relationships,  it has proven that it is not the &quot;pursued ones&quot; fault for creating the &quot;friendzone&quot;  it&#39;s the fault of the person who is chasing &quot;more&quot;.   One needs to understand and adhere to their limits and be honest with themselves and their intentions.   You can only be &quot;used&quot; if you allow it.
I love the part where he mentions getting friend zoned and goes and talks about something else entirely
I will get friend zoned if i want.
My closest friend is the most amazing, attractive woman I have ever met. This relationship will probably last a lifetime if we keep it just the way it is.
I found nowhere where is the way to &quot;never get friend zone again&quot;...you just started talking about being angry...You changed topic.",PT9M23S
Jordan Peterson on what a woman is. #shorts #jordanpeterson #viral,,1540022,53043,1137,2022-09-21T10:55:56Z,"They are freaking gay
They&#39;re are only 2 gender in this world. Man &amp; Woman.
&quot;for clarity&quot;? The question itself is manipulative! Some find it hard to define &quot;woman&quot;. Now, they&#39;ll find it harder to define &quot;real&quot;. If you put &quot;trans&quot; before &quot;woman&#39;, you add a new element to the entity &quot;woman&quot;. How do you relate this to &quot;real&quot;? Start by defining what a woman is and we&#39;ll go from there.
A stupid woman ask what is a real woman
It&#39;s an anomaly it&#39;s a psychological issue coz of you imbibing life in a very different aspect through multiple factors......trans is not a gender so stop denying a very good creation by science or God.
They are not women, they are UFOs
Transgenders are not women by birth. But because they cannot live life as a man they are altered to live life like women so that they can live life happily with the help of medical science. No they are not women but what you&#39;ll do the boys who are suffering from this things and being suicides bullying in schools and colleges and neighbours and friends. Even trying hard to behave and be like a man still the boy doesn&#39;t come out of changes and still act like a women even after doctors helping him with being mental illness. The last option is transitioning.
Change ‚Äòreal‚Äô into ‚Äònatural‚Äô and the discussion is over.
That&#39;s a pretty good answer üòÆ
Absurd and crazy question. Men are men, women are women.why do we need to accept something is not real just because they think they are women n dress like women. We are forced to agree with them. This is nonsense. Islam is simple and logical. We do not accept this crazy and absurd thinking.
Transgenders for me are stupid...they don&#39;t have common sense..or they just really insist on something they knew is TRUTH just to suit to they wanted to be
Trans woman are dudes who like to dress like a woman. Still a dude.
The answer is no!!!

Jordan Peterson Takes On Transgender 'Radicals' With Piers Morgan,"Clinical psychologist Dr Jordan B Peterson joins Piers Morgan Uncensored to discuss gender identity and why many people in the modern age are 'scared' to answer the question 'what is a woman?' for fear of backlash from radicals. 

Piers brings up some examples of people being 'cancelled' for their views on gender, including when Macy Gray received a massive backlash online for her views and was forced to retract them in a statement.

If a person wants to change anything about their biological/physiological status perhaps there should be legal issues around birth certificates that would need to change if physiology changes so that the birth certificate would record male or female based on medical assessment  then its so. What a person wants to identify as is a perception and ridiculous as its not biology.
Jordan Petersons resting face is mean lol still great
I think the biggest reason transgender bullshit got as far as it has is because of LGBT. The L, the G, and the B all refer to homosexuality in one way or another, but that T does not belong. It is something else entirely, nothing to do with sexuality. It was tacked on for political reasons. Transgender advocates paint it as the new civil rights, the new gay rights movement, but that simply isn&#39;t the case. People want to be on the right side of history, they want to defend civil rights, and the activists have taken advantage of that to intentionally use terminology and frame the narrative in a way that makes it look like they are the victims who need civil rights protected. In fact, their movement has nothing to do with civil rights and everything to do with a complete denial of the most obvious, basic fact of human existence! They want to control the education of young children and control the media, because the way to power is to control information. It worked for Hitler. It works right now for Putin and Xi. It is disgusting. I don&#39;t like conservatives, but I believe we need more people like De Santis stepping up and saying, okay, at the bare minimum we need to at least keep this nonsense out of the schools, especially for those who have not even reached age of puberty yet!
Piers Morgan and Jordan Peterson. The only two &quot;normal&quot; people saying the obvious! (by that I mean people who aren&#39;t a part of the religious right). And I&#39;m glad Piers brought up that moment with Ketanshi Brown Jackson, because I remember noticing that too, and I felt then I was the only one! How in the world can a Supreme Court Justice not feel comfortable saying what a woman is! And the woman who does is bullied into an apology? Outrageous!
Hy is the US releasing these scourges on other people?
Macy Gray shouldn&#39;t have apologized, why is everyone apologizing over this? why isn&#39;t there an apology for saying a women no longer exists???  no such thing as a woman?  I want an apology.
@jakobrobinson6985<br>that is just how crazy people talk, they do not reason, don&#39;t understand reason, and come from a place of no reasoning - all these debates and arguments are futile, crazy only understands crazy
Thankfully I homeschool my daughter so she‚Äôs not been exposed to these mentally ill people, trying to push their deluded world view onto her.
Last time I checked men had men parts and women have women parts. When did there  become a discussion about. This I mean how far is this going to go before someone get kicked in the face with common sense.
LEAVE TRANS PEOPLE ALONE. You. Yes you that‚Äôs about to comment something hateful. Stop. Just stop and think. I know this contradicts your entire reality. I know it‚Äôs hard to even try to understand. It hurts. You find it offensive. You think or believe it offends your religion. <br>These are human beings. Healthy human beings. You are a human being. We are human beings. I know we can‚Äôt agree on much as humans. We have never agreed on much. But we all want to be happy. We all want peace. We all just want to live our best lives. <br>Let us. Equal rights for others don‚Äôt mean less rights for you. It‚Äôs not pie. No one is taking anything from you. You are respected. Why can‚Äôt you respect these wonderful humans. They are no more or less than you. If you think this goes against your religion, and you want different. Hating people you disagree with isn‚Äôt going to make them want to listen to you. And if you want them to go away that is genocide. Just like the Jewish in WW2, trans people, especially trans youth are being attacked right now. They are being prosecuted for being themselves. People don‚Äôt care if trans kids kill themselves because they can‚Äôt be themselves, but they sure as hell want to attack them for existing and taking up space without hurting anything. They have never done anything to anyone. You are the one with the privilege. Your rights are not being threatened just by letting another group into humanity. I would say that god wants us to spread love and not hate. Please just let trans people be.
Trans people have truefobia
When the joke has gone too far. I am lucky I get to live in a society of clowns, no day is boring
Macey Grey was absolutely spot on.. the fact she was forced to apologise just shows how people are being bullied into not having the right to their own opinion, to please men who want to be women.
well my question to a clinical psychologist is, &quot;if a person believes they can change genders, what then would be the highest number of observed characteristics in those cases procreation behaviors?‚Äù More specifically any diagnosed  cases  of brood parasitism like behavior of the psychosis itself that presents as gender dystrophia?
Thank you for keeping the discussion going. That&#39;s the only way we gain understanding and evolve.
The only thing you are doing is increasin suicides.
Transgender ‚Äúradicals‚Äù? Everything supposed 911 terrorism on both sides the isles.  If politics is that much about terrorism we should sure get rid of it. Especially politically polarized negative opinion based media commentators that are always parasiticly making money by ripping our country apart and influencing strife and harm to the American peoples

IT GETS REAL SERIOUS, when pure logic is totally ignored and such a tiny minority of morons have this much power. There are so many cowards out there in the world that know what is right but I too afraid to say it. The media exaggerate the issue so incredibly well, the public start to believe they no longer have a say and the governments are so STUPID they think the issue is bigger than it is so they cave in.

Phobias are among the most common of all mental illnesses, and they are usually the most successfully treated. if a mental illness is potentially dangerous for the individual or others around them, they are to be involuntary commited for professional treatment. &lt;this is facts that apparently counts for every mental disorder except for transphobia and homophobia, this is 2023, let&#39;s patch the holes in our flawed system and together create a better future for everyone.

Last night I attempted to have a conversation with a new friend about Transgender identity. This person has always been quite kind and easy to talk to up until this conversation. At no point did I exclaim that they were wrong or that their opinion was invalid. I expressed that I was interested in gaining knowledge of their opinion whilst also expressing my own. At every point in the conversation before I could make my point they jumped over me, evaded my point, and came back to the reassertion that I was transphobic. It was not a discussion. The conversation ended with them proclaiming that I am uneducated, I have no compassion, and I don‚Äôt respect other people. I wish that having a discussion was still okay, As I stated multiple times within my argument. I would never go out of my way to make anyone upset, Thought I will show everybody respect that does not mean I am obliged to agree with them. I wish that the person had felt the same, I wish that they could have seen that I was not attacking them. I was merely attempting to gain an understanding of there view whilst also expressing mine. This has made me scared to ever discuss this issue with anyone ever again.",PT4M39S
Modern Times: Camille Paglia & Jordan B Peterson,"Dr. Camille Paglia is a well-known American intellectual and social critic. She has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (where this discussion took place) since 1984. She is the author of seven books focusing on literature, visual art, music, and film history, among other topics. The most well-known of these is Sexual Personae (http://amzn.to/2xVGEEV), an expansion of her highly original doctoral thesis at Yale. The newest, Free Women, Free Men:  Sex, Gender, Feminism, was published by Pantheon Books in March 2017 (http://amzn.to/2hGycTG). 
 
Dr. Paglia has been warning about the decline and corruption of the modern humanities for decades, and she is a serious critic of the postmodern ethos that currently dominates much of academia. Although she is a committed equity feminist, she firmly opposes the victim/oppressor narrative that dominates much of modern American and British feminism. 
 
In this wide-ranging discussion, we cover (among other topics) the pernicious influence of the French intellectuals of the 1970's on the American academy, the symbolic utility of religious tradition, the tendency toward intellectual conformity and linguistic camouflage among university careerists, the under-utilization of Carl Jung and his student, Erich Neumann, in literary criticism and the study of the humanities, and the demolition of the traditional roles and identity of men and women in the West.

She is a pro-p*****ile acticist
Marvelous just marvelous. I&#39;m watching this for the second time. <br>n now I know why I felt the Foucault thing as a dumb ideology when they taught me that in my academics.
I love this. I love the way Camille expresses herself as well. Give me more.
ONCE IN A LIFETIME THING LIKE THIS......
Wow what an amazing discussion! I want a rematch with discussion update on the current situation with ESG and DEI issues
Fantastic conversation! Thank you for having it and sharing with all of us.
&quot;Whoever is dissatisfied with himself is continually ready for revenge, and we others will be his victims, if only by having to endure his ugly sight. For the sight of what is ugly makes one bad and gloomy.&quot; (Nietzsche, The Gay Science 290)
As a primary teacher I‚Äôve noticed a huge increase in  group chanting‚Ä¶ to get their way.  It is endemic.  And it‚Äôs spoiled.  Disgusting.  Very scary.
I love listening to both of these amazing humans. Good use of the internet!
Hurricane Camille! You go, girl! I am on the opposite end of politics from Camille, but she is an honest leftist. She calls a spade a spade, no matter what. And her thoughts are consistent. Try looking for consistency in any other current liberal.
As Hendrix saw it, he was creating &quot;electric church music&quot;<br><br>Lou Reed&#39;s &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; --<br><br>Some people like to go out dancing<br>And other people, (like us) they gotta work<br>And there‚Äôs always some evil mothers<br>They‚Äôll tell you life is full of dirt.<br>And the women never really faint,<br>And the villans always blink their eyes.<br>And the children are the only ones who blush.<br>‚ÄòCause life is just to die.<br>But, anyone who has a heart<br>Wouldn‚Äôt want to turn around and break it<br>And anyone who ever played the part<br>He wouldn‚Äôt want to turn around and fake it
Dear Dr Peterson, if you think that Marxists approve of identity politics you couldn&#39;t be more wrong.  Identity politics are actually disdained by proper marxists.  There are a lot of fake ones out there and fake &quot;Leftists&quot; aka Liberals as well.  Marxists believe in the concrete and the real, that is the basis of economic and social relations.
One of the biggest differences between Peterson and Paglia it that Paglia&#39;s is driven by passion. Can&#39;t say that about Peterson. I&#39;ve watched Peterson from the time he taught in Canada and how his ego has grown and grown was his  followers grown and grown. Does anyone know what year this took place? I ask becuase Peterson does not look no where near how angry he looks in 2023. I based my first comment for years latter. Peterson is actually so much more agreeable here then now.
I bloody love this woman.
I was a professor of literature for 45 years, and i saw a whole generation of students forced to pay obesience to the post modern theorists. Graduate students were obliged to read these post modernists or they were belittled and ostracized by the faculty. They had to pretend to understand them, and then write dissertations using their ludicrous language and ideas, as though anyone could actually understand what they were saying. The faculty hated Paglia. The post modernists, as they are saying, took beauty out of literature and any common understanding of the humanistic values in literary works.  I lived through this ideological insanity.
I want to gripe about one thing she said<br>I think she may not be seeing the full implications of abortion rights being implemented. <br>The reason we single so few siblings in the families, the reason we see teenage pregnancy and single motherhood skyrocketing is directly because you have the option of sex, without the consequences. For women at least.<br>When you take away the truthful consequences of any action you diminish that action. As we have seen with sex.
Professor Paglia and her style of discourse reminds me of (one of) my favorite comedians: Richard Lewis. There&#39;s a kind of manic intensity to her discourse delivery when she gets going
Intellectual lightweights,stick to smartphone activism, nothing for you here.
This guy is so angry and so annoying. He is mk ultra victim
Amazing conversation. Her criticism and opinion of the universities,  professors, remind me of Eric Weinstein&#39;s.
I‚Äôm not sure a agree w the premise that woman are being tyrannical in the workplace these days. Or that modern women are unhappy. We have our complaints but mostly the modern women I know are happy enough. I work in a male dominated field and we all get along like professionals. I agree w a lot of what what the lady is saying but I feel that the opposition they are raging against is a minuscule minority.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM&amp;t=11m53s"">11:53</a> I find this part really funny
camille paglia openly supports pedophilia, jordan is a fraud that completley ignored this part of her past statements
I think more attention needs to be paid to credentialism more and more becoming a social justice weapon.<br><br>As sane people with more traditional values are turned further and further off from higher education inevitability the amount of credentialed individuals cycling through the neoliberal american higher education system who identify with that ideology as a means of making it through will increase.<br><br>By default the professional class in America is bcoming more authoritarian and rigidly attatched to neoliberalism/neoconservativism. <br><br>All of these elitist, establishment authoritarians pretending to be leftists would be a subject for hilarity if it wasnt so tragic. The mainstream left played a very important contarian role to the state.... now its become a weapon of the state.<br><br>There is absolutely 100% an attempt in America to ignore history. The concept that you cannot interpret history through a modern political framework is anethema to the way things are done in higher education in America.  I dont think I had one class in university during my American studies that wasn&#39;t focused on historical mistakes pretty much every god damn Republic in history made.  <br><br>Establishing a republic while co-existing with a system of institutionalized bondage in some for was the NORM for most of human history. <br><br>Every. Great. Historical. Republic. Had. Some. Form. Of. Slavery. <br><br>All of our good stuff comes from these republics too.
postmodernism for the most part is more of a reaction to the epoch of consumerism and corporate power however postmodernism is often shaded or sympathetic to elements of tribalism that infect its ideologies as postmodernism is very much pluralistic in its nature. i think postmodernism at its CORE is SENSITIVITY which is something that is actually positive but this sensitivity can become nihilism and overly critical when it stops being open and is co-opted by lesser forces.
i love this lady
I think the hatred he can&#39;t understand or explain seething from those in these groups and movements is actually a bitterness, anger, and even hatred against God.  During the 60s she spoke of them being against the establishment and that now, it is false and more self-centered. I really feel it can be simplified down to them being personally offended by and angry at God himself and feeling that they and how they feel are more important than what God deems to be important or of value, for sure. They are self-worshippers, if you will.
God! Jordan says some ridiculous things.  &quot;Electrical grid and communications work 100% of the time.&quot;  Also, &quot;Poeple who were abuse their own children were abused as children, AND people who were abused as children don&#39;t abuse their children.&quot; For a man who has some very important and valuable things to say, he also says some ridiculously stupid things. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM&amp;t=1h01m30s"">1:01:30</a>) Geez!!
Here is the irony. Jordan Peterson ‚ÄúStop wasting time!‚Äù How am I supposed to do that and abandon this mesmerizing interview by two of some of the brightest minds of our times. I have known about Camille, and read her work, many, many years ago. Only feminist/atheist, I would ever listen to, in fact embrace. I have read those that say she is just trying to repent for her sins of being complicit in starting this movement, but I have been listening to her tell the truth as she sees it, and I agree with everything I have read from her, for a very long time‚Ä¶
&quot;He created identity politics without it&#39;s present distortions&quot; - why is it so hard for people to recognize that the &quot;present distortions&quot; of poisonous ideologies are the inevitable, logical conclusions of those ideologies....Everyone needs to go back and re-read Nietzsche to understand the problem of value when you imagine you have murdered God.
I love this all these year latter. At about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM&amp;t=39m00s"">39:00</a> the malignant famine. This might sound crazy but I think gay men are a sort of savior right now. They seem to be able to detect this way easier than straight men and they know how to fight back. If you have not found a gay man who has checked out of the blue church yet, now is the time.
&quot;...sane women standing up against their crazy sisters&quot;... Yes! As a sane woman (usually, lol), I must do more standing up! And risk the slings and arrows of outrageous women...
I just wanna be a fly on the wall next time these two are talking with no one else listening!!üòÇ
I LOVE that she is so filled with and passionate about what she&#39;s saying, her mouth can barely keep up!!üòçüòÜ
so fucking pretentious lmao
I listen to Jordan Peterson regularly. This is the best conversation I&#39;ve ever heard with him.
Camille is a Supernova
Having watched this video several times, I reckon I have to curse what ever ideas I was brought up to believe true; especially at university. üò¢üò¢üò¢
she is so expressive peterson uncharacteristicly sits silent drinking it all in. Beautiful !
I‚Äôd have like to see Camille Paglia in conversation with Brian Sewell
This is a conversation that resonates so much for me and my reality of the world. I&#39;m glad I discovered it, and makes me feel less alone in my values and beliefs.
this is a triumph! this was a needed conversation.
How much more time she‚Äôs going to repeat goddman ‚Äúokay‚Äù?)
Maybe this is why god shuts down and wipe out certain preverted societies like ours . Its like &#39;no time to explain. Switch off and switch back on&#39;
God. So much to unpack. Feels like my brain is gonna smoke üòÖ gonna have to watch this more than once. These are real people talking about real issues face to face with the intend to figure things out not to win or insult each other. Bravo!
673 times she said OK  üëå  I&#39;m joking I didn&#39;t count üòÖ
Jordan, you say there‚Äôs nothing more dangerous than a weak man,  could you share your thoughts on specifically the dangers of both weak men AND women and describe the potential hazards of both? And now, hear me out, as a solution to the problem of weakness would it not be a potential option for human ‚Äúcourtship?‚Äù practices to adopt an additional level of complexity that for woman involves a display of moral and physical strength for male suitors and a display of emotional and moral fortitude from woman? What are your thoughts on if we could or should and how we could naturally incorporate this in a way that is capable of being written down?

I agree that pertaining to his circumlocution, Jordan outworks almost everybody.
I&#39;m grateful if those who are transgender do NOT believe that Jordan Peterson and his biblical nonsense of a god creating only male and female ... knows what is right for them.<br><br>I&#39;m grateful if people know that Jordan Peterson earned most of his big bucks from the support of Conservative Christians ... while badmouthing all things on the left.<br><br>I&#39;m grateful to live in Canada, no matter which party is in &quot;office.&quot; <br><br>And I&#39;m grateful that in Canada we no longer live under the dictatorship of Christian Protestant policy makers ... as occurred not very long ago ... because of their biblical interpretations.<br><br>   From the book ‚Ä¶ Drop Dead: A Horrible History of Hanging in Canada, author ‚Ä¶ Lorna Poplak. <br><br>   Capital punishment, the execution of someone found guilty of a crime, dates back to arrival of the European explorers on our shores. In those days, if you were condemned to death, quite a wide range of methods could be used to punish you. You could be hanged, or face a firing squad, or be burned at the stake. <br><br>   Although Canada remained a collection of separate British colonies until Confederation in 1876, a Royal Proclamation in 1763 replaced the prevailing Canadian legal system with the laws of England.  <br><br>   By the end of the 1700s in Britain, however, the litany of crimes regarded as sufficiently horrible to warrant the death penalty had swelled to 220, including nefarious acts as keeping company with gypsies or skulking in the dark with a blackened face. <br><br>   In 1828, Patrick Burgan of Saint John, New Brunswick, aged eighteen or nineteen, received the death penalty for the double offence of stealing a watch and some money from his former employer and clothing from a sailors‚Äô boarding house. <br><br>   Given the power and pre-eminence of religion in Canada at that time, your very life would have been in jeopardy if you were caught scrawling slogans on the side of a church. You could also be hanged for stealing your neighbor‚Äôs cow, which was the fate of B. Clement of Montreal. And just in case you thought that the law protected the young as it does today, think again. Children were regarded as miniature adults and treated as such ‚Äî Clement was only thirteen years old when executed.

That is a Democrat thing. Words! They even got the FDA to change the definition of VACCINE!!
Do part 2 of this interview
This woman needs to calm down with her over focusing on singular blinded points instead of attacking my goodness
This woman was clearly outmatched. JP is one of the best thinkers of this century. She is just reactionary with a agenda. <br><br>His thoughts are really well put together. She was outmatched from the beginning and didn&#39;t know it.
May i suggest that you rig up a mic for your girl so she is louder. It is very hard to hear her, i&#39;m guessing you are sharing the same mic that is tuned to your voice, since  your voice is a lot louder when she speaks  we can barely hear her..
I have only seen Jordan lose his cool a couple of times.  Let me say this : Jordan losing his cool compared to others is very low key.  He is a very calm, thought provoking individual.
Best thing about Peterson he doesn&#39;t have his phone in his hand looking at anything he never quotes anyone else. his opinions and factual data are what he uses. And they are straight fire every time
I find that woman (75 yo whie woman here--worked my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8YlLMyMaXo&amp;t=16m30s"">16:30</a>  whole life, no children--fate not by choice), raised a lot of other people&#39;s children...), I literally cannot listen to this woman!!!<br><br>Love you both!!
She is thinking in &quot;THE NARRATIVE&quot; she does not have any THOUGHTS of HER OWN!!
This woman is not TRULY listening to Person or THINKING ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HE IS SAYING!!
Here is the difference. He is dealing in facts and truth and she is trying to sell a narrative based on emotion.
You missed the best bit! :D
Just as a listener I slwould suggest that you do not just stop the video mid interview. It&#39;s frustrating on numerous levels.
JP seems like a beast and seems like a great person
‚ÄúThe worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal.‚Äù Aristotle

Its very difficult to hear what your girl is saying bro. For these reactions your fans need to hear you speak
You two did a good job, but can you put the microphone closer to her? She talks very softly, and he talks much louder. My volume control was getting a workout.
I absolutely love Jordan Peterson!!! I will watch any reaction videos to him.
another example of the media trying their best to control the narrative .... aaaaaaaaand... getting shut down.
Chris. Please be less soft spoken. I&#39;m interested in what you have to say but just can&#39;t hear you. Recommend you react to the rest of this interview if you haven&#39;t already. It gets a whole lot better.
Women like her are their own worst enemy. Instead of listening and maybe learning something, she always goes back to her talking point. She has to be correct even if she knows she&#39;s not. Your wife is not only beautiful but is also a good listener and expresses herself without being bitchy about it. People who act like this woman are not even worth listening to. Every conversation has to be controversial, and only her opinions (even if incorrect) matter.
Another bait trapping interview with the interview only goal is to pounce on the interviewee with an &quot;aha! Gotcha&quot; moment...
Its very divisive that Oprahs audience is majority female.
For a &quot;reporter&quot;, she doesn&#39;t listen very well.  In addition, it seems her only purpose is to bombard him with &quot;gotcha&quot; questions.  She isn&#39;t a very good thinker.
i have the exact same hour pay as my female counterparts , at the end of the month, i have 20% more money in my bank account, because i work also night shift and sundays, things they dont want to do. a newcomer started to complain i was getting more than the women ( i m the only man) and it was unfair, i said, ok, i will give u some nightshifts and sundays.... she refused....then i said , stop complaining about me working more then.
This woman brought a wet noodle to gun fight..
Jordan is way too intelligent for this broad üòÇ
So she just gets to make stuff up and pretend he said things he didn&#39;t? Not the right approach if you want to be heard
You missed the end where he destroys her with one statement and she don&#39;t know what to say... It&#39;s what made the interview so wonderful...I don&#39;t understand why that is missing!! How odd!!!
Does anyone else think this woman sounds like the mother superior in Sister Act?
She is a sterling example of todays society. Pick and choose the facts you like and ignore or omit the ones that dont fit the agenda you want. Garbage &quot;journalist&quot; or whatever she calls herself.
All she did is tried to put words in his mouth.
Watch the whole interview for that &quot;gotcha&quot; moment,  she crumbles!
What‚Äôs wild is that Jordan is the only one in the conversation who cares about actually solving the problem. That requires being honest about the cause, not just slinging blame so you can paint yourself as morally superior. These leftists are SO concerned about giving themselves POWER, they don‚Äôt actually care in the slightest about the ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù groups they‚Äôre using to do that. They don‚Äôt care about minorities or the poor or women. They want power. And it shows when they refuse to have a genuine discussion about actions that would actually make things better.
Funny that your LIVE sign says EVIL üôÇ
If u have a man and a woman and the man works 50% more hours he will be paid more by her definition that‚Äôs unfair no it‚Äôs not
That interviewing woman is a blatant misogynist. It‚Äôs oozing out of every question. She asks. What a hateful, repugnant human being she is disgusting.
Complete this video. This was a great portion but the whole video is worth watching
Pay gap? I wanna see more ladies doing construction. More important i wanna see them doing the job right. Ill go push the paper. I didn&#39;t do all the construction in my life because of pay entirely. I did it mostly for the challenge. From what ive seen the kids stopped challenging themselves. Mentally and physically. They stopped hunting the truth. So now its hunting them.
You should have reacted to the whole video...This is like watching only the first half of a movie...frustrating
Its &quot;ask&quot; not &quot;axt&quot;!!!!! is it ignorance or some culture thing???
The woman in that video has no interest in discussion and conversation. She&#39;s only in it to promote her own shallow viewpoint. Jordan Peterson is one of the few people who actually knows how to handle a person like this because of who he is and because of the knowledge and experience he has. He can put his talking partner in a position where they have no choice but to acknowledge the truth of what he says. Sadly that&#39;s not the case for most people. If you lack either the knowledge, the experience or the skills, these oppressive talking partners can make use of it to shut down your arguments since you cannot put up a wall that they cannot break down with their dominance since they are backed by major corporations.<br><br>And even these days I&#39;d say Jordan Peterson can&#39;t even talk the way he did back then since the truth these days doesn&#39;t matter at all. They will just call you names, falsely accuse you, etc and you&#39;re shut down and censored without any way to defend yourself.
JORDAN PETERSON?! C&#39;MON guys. You can do better than world&#39;s dumbest intellectual .This is the guy that everyone makes fun of.
Imagine thousands of people picking over every public idea you ever expressed and actively pursue to twist and pervert it in any fashion possible.<br>She attempts just that, but his articulate speech is not faltered he stands firm.<br>Now, transcript every notion from her side and apply the same critique... nothing she posits is grounded in any way -- her speech is all  banter.
When shes talking it&#39;s  a complete lack of empathy towards men.....&quot;so you&#39;re saying women are unhappy dominating men&quot;....who the f cares if a narcissistic woman are unhappy controlling her husband?<br>......it&#39;s such a narcissistic and evil way to look at something, how can you try to empathize with someone that is controlling/dominant to their partner? And why should what the individual has between their legs decide whether it&#39;s moral or not?<br>ü§°üåç

Jordan Peterson - The most PROBLEMATIC intellectual of our time,"Jordan Peterson is easily the most problematic public intellectual of our time. From his assault on the LGBT community (what he calls the post-modern neo-marxist types) to his defense of traditional christian values. I examine it in this video.

Hey bro, how do you deal with persistent Muslim apologist <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/RH6-WWSezH8?feature=share"">https://youtube.com/shorts/RH6-WWSezH8?feature=share</a>
A good video overall however if I were to apply the same rationale that you have used here to discredit Peterson , that is, a few specific example of quoting papers but him being wrong about what they actually say then you would have to criticise yourself for the exact same thing. It seems that you have employed the exact same tactic you accuse him of. It is false of you to present the argument on the gender pay gap as an anti-feminist one. Although it could be fairly demonstrated that someone may choose to justify their anti-feminism with this argument in part it is not true to present this as Petersons argument he does not use it justify an anti woman position. I would say that you have not read the paper. You say that it using a multi varied analysis still determines the pay gap to be 9% this is true but the paper does not conclude that the 9% discrepancy is due to discrimination against woman, it does suggest that this is a possible reason and admittedly the authors seem to believe it the probable cause but they do then discuss the possibility of the difference being due to psychological factors between men and woman which is precisely what he says (although they say this does not account for all of the unaccounted for discrepancy and of course the remainder is indeed discrimination but again this is actually what Peterson says as he never denies the existence of the discrimination) As well the paper precisely states that the biggest discrepancies are due to occupation choice, relocation, child rearing, the industry you work in pretty much all of the things he says. Please see below three quotes in the authors words directly lifted from their own conclusion.<br><br>Quotes from paper below.<br><br>The persistence of an unexplained gender wage gap suggests, though it does not prove, that labor-market discrimination continues to contribute to the gender wage gap, just as the decrease in the unexplained gap we found in our analysis of the trends over time in the gender gap suggests, though it does not prove, that decreases in discrimination help to explain the decrease in the gap. <br><br>Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes, and we have reviewed an impressive array of recent research suggesting that there are indeed notable gender differences along this dimension. While male advantages in some factors, like risk aversion and propensity to negotiate or compete, may help to explain not only some of the unexplained gender wage gap but also gender differences in occupations and fields of study, it is important to note that women may have advantages in some other areas, like interpersonal skills.<br><br> The notable finding from this exer- cise is that, in each case, gender differences in psychological factors account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences. Thus, this source of the gender gap, based at least on what we know at this point, while worth pursuing, does not appear to provide a silver bullet in our understanding of gen- der differences in labor-market outcomes
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
He didn&#39;t say atheists are murderes tbh ...he said that atheists take decisions based on morality as defined by the society.<br><br>And the fact that you are the only creator saying that there was no mention of f legislation on someones speech not existing in bill c16 makes me want to read it myself because even the trans people that debated him directly did not put this point forth.
People always remember, even if someone cites scientific papers, that doesnt mean you should believe that person blindly. You have to dig deeper and see the experimental setup used by those papers to actually see its merit. Its jp or pranav, dont be fooled by fancy english and their attempts to create a narrative through selective assembly of &quot;facts&quot;. Be safe out there. And most importantly, &quot;trust, but verify&quot;.
Okay so this man made some some very good arguments because he is using the same fallacies that he is saying jordan peterson uses. Well firstly jordan peterson never said pay gap never existed. He also said in that interview that gender is one of th emany factors that determin the pay gap. I think this man&#39;s argument on the relegious front were pretty solid. Theism can never be defendend in an argument but what jbp says is that without a god living is difficult so that is why you should believe in god. I mean if you are a theist then there could be a lot of advantage for you. Jbp says that you become responsible by being a theist and by bearing your cross. Lots of knowledge can be derived from the biblical stories i.e same with the stories inany other religion. But jbp&#39;s argument on if god really existed are weak. But this man&#39;s interpretation of the c-16 is hillarious. Well there is a propoganda section in the bill c-16 which compells you to use gender pronouns in a certain way as to not offend a certain community. Well this is shit and this is an attack on freedom of speech and there are other arguments also on the lgbtq issue. I mean fluid gender identity will result in the fallout of society. Jordan peterson was invited to senate hearing by rhe candian court twice to speak on the bill. That explains his competence and research on the subject. As for climate change you can listen to bjorn lomborg for that. Overall apart from the relegious part this whole video was full of bullshit lies and fallacies.
Atleast someone was have same critical view as mine about jp ..but i to afraid to explain to someone because his followers was abusive and toxic.
There was also a series of talks with Dr.Sam Harris where the latter defended the atheist‚Äôs position very well.

You know the world has gone mad when we start calling people like JP problematic
I would like to correct a part, where you said Jordan Peterson called atheist &quot;murde***&quot;, he didn&#39;t called people who believed themselves as being atheist that way, he said that if you really where to be one, you could very well be a m******. In other words, deep down, you are still a (whatever religion you where before) even tho you distanced yourself from the prayers or even never prayed (the society continuing to fonction on those values anyway). Because it is so profoundly founded within you, that it&#39;s even hard to even break out of it. And maybe you shouldn&#39;t really break out of it. <br><br>But I think it&#39;s okay to challenge religion, especially when it&#39;s being dictated words for words by non-thinkers who claim to be always right no matter what. <br>However I also believe, if you ever &quot;wished&quot; or &quot;hoped&quot; for something in your life to happen, you are, in fact, faithful and therefore a believer. Even tho you don&#39;t put a definite orthographe on what god or definition that must be. <br><br>I personally call myself a human who happen to believe, maybe agnostic is the most appropriate word for it.
Pranay you are right on jordan but ironically bad and toxic part of feminist are on front line who are already privileged and comes from higher class abuse the privileges for their own gain and feed their ego spreading hatred towards men worldwide but real feminism isn&#39;t helping empowering lower class and poor womens and misguiding them to hate mens and become Supreme as individual.  Therefore guys like jordan appears to be defenders and Nothing else.
Hi @ScienceIsDope, i think u being an atheist has somewhat made your opinion a little biased. Being a fanboy of somebody is mistake that no one should make and will give you credit that you have stopped fanboying on jordan peterson but in the same video I think you were fanboying for people like richard dawkins, will etc. While my perception of jordan peterson as also changed but I think your critique is not nuanced enough. Anybody wo speaks on &#39;god&#39; should read a good amount of philosophy and what I think is that worldview matters a lot. Problem with western atheists or theists alike is that there is a Judeo-Christian world view in which they operate(which jordan peterson points out but has failed to read other philosophies). I also somewhat agree with his critique of new age atheists (like dawkins and harris), specifically dawkins. While the books written by dawkins are really good they fail to compete somebody like carl jung (which jordan points out in his discussion with susan <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syP-OtdCIho)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syP-OtdCIho)</a>. Atheism (nastik) in indian context is mostly defined by charvaka philosophy (you can check this video for basics of indian philosophy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4sYkNBErpU)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4sYkNBErpU)</a>. There are other eastern (middle eastern ) philosophies also which should be read. I am not saying in any shape of form that indian (or eastern) philosophies are best, but to know different worldviews you should read everything and then make a conclusion.
Dude I used to be a fan of this channel, but this video is extremely disingenuous. Firstly if you had an ounce of intellectual honesty, you would call out the ridiculousness of the trans agenda and how unscientific it is. It denies basic biology and how the governments across the west are caving in to the lgbt mob and introducing laws. Secondly how is JP the most Problematic intellectual, clearly a clickbait title , there are literal extremist ideologues who travel the world espousing violence, you haven‚Äôt given one reason why he is the worst. There are Marxist intellectuals who call for complete state control of resources. Seems like you have a personal left leaning bias , which is fine, but dunking on right leaning individuals under the garb of science is quite dishonest and misleading.
Like anything üòÇüòÇ<br>He talks generally about western world and their shit.... And for that perspective he is true<br>But whenever he takes account asia or our culture or history, he&#39;s as bad as a dumbass<br>We have different problems nd different perspectives about almost everything <br>Just common sense.... people be arguing in comments for no reason üíØ
About Bill C16, it indeed doesnt obligate people to use the preferred pronouns but the protest of JP was because the university of torinto obliged him to use the perferred pronouns, as for God, everyone has a different interpretation in belief I‚Äôm not a believer myself but in JP‚Äôs vieuw god is in morals and therefore everyone believes in his own ‚ÄòGod‚Äô so he doesn‚Äôt define god as a supreme being or anything but actually tries to say that everyone believes in something that he specifies as a god. Now research about the gender paygap is very hard because everyone has different personalities and characteristics so you can‚Äôt really make statics about that and multiple studies can have completely different results. However this video is great criticism about JP!
I just buy his book ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤üò£üò≠
Indians needs to save this men! He is a gem üíé ‚ù§ please make videos like this and empower us üôè
For a person tooting about rationality and logic all the time, calling Peterson the &quot;most&quot; problematic intellectual is such a bias.
I&#39;m guessing he got the idea for climate change from a wise man ... &quot;he who cannot be named&quot;.....from India!! üòÇ
Next video on Ben Shapiro
Regarding free speech and LGBTQ, you told that bill C 16 is created to protect members of the group. But, what is &quot;misgendering&quot;? I mean one choosing not to call a physically male person as a transwomen with an appropriate pronoun can be considered as &quot;hate speech&quot;. Till now hate speech generally means &quot;making comments or words that hurt a group or a person&quot; but with this bill, doesn&#39;t it count to hate speech, by choosing not to use the pronouns that one is being forced to follow, just because the other person &quot;wants&quot; to be called that way! Come on....

got to know about you by Dhruv&#39;s status
Fake gurus and intellectual always confuse people with unnecessary words religion also does the same,not giving a clear straight answer is a clear strategy to engage people confuse people so that they keep on reading following or beleeivng bullshit,for eg Start reading any Book It is filled with Mysoginy And Casteism still you will agree with it bcz its filled with so many unnecessary stories mi recently read garud puran its so Mysogiynstic that it appreciate Sati also it gives formula for giving birth to male child and its filled wirh Brahman praise and We should all keep on donating to brhaman if we want Punya lokas for our beloved deceased,My father died recently so i read it on my own for his spirit now i realise there is no soul our mind is the only thing when we die we stop existing
This claim is kinda skeptical ( not related to the video) <br>Its on hawan and its benefits <br>Here&#39;s the article <br><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724851/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724851/</a><br>Kinda give ur opinions
Let&#39;s breakdown your arguments, first mistake, you assumed that he used the paper you showed here. Now it is more likely that he used the findings of that paper combined with other papers and presented his arguments. Cathy newman was in no way right, she had no figures herself, all she had was a belief that it exists only because of gender and not ready to believe that other factors might contrbute to it. As of now I couldn&#39;t find any research that can show conclusively how much percentage gap is due to discrimintation. More to it you just left the viewers with the thought there is 9% gap but the very paper says that &quot;The unexplained portion of the gender pay gap may include the effects of unmeasured productivity or compensating differentials, and some of the explanatory variables such as industry or occupation may be affected by discrimination&quot;. And as you go more deep into paper, it actually talks about biases of beliefs not discirmination of gender, it shows lot of case where men a re preffered but also highlights that even women employers prefers men in area like maths and then it also talks about women being paid more in specific areas. I&#39;ve read other studies as well that shows there are a lot of areas for specific age group where women are paid more. Now what you did here is used one side of the argument and presented half cooked information and that&#39;s intellectual dishonesty on your part. <br><br>Secondly, religion and spiritality is a very tricky subject, you being an atheist, it&#39;s very ahrd to convince you otherwise. The only thing I could get from this that it seems you have only seen JP talking about god in a debate, and when you are debating it becomes tough to be rational as you want to win the debate. But more importnatly I think you should see his biblical lecture series not the debates as they give much more detailed explanation. Also, I feel that you should go and read upanishad, whenever you talk about god it seems you have a very superficial understanding of the subject and always use the argument that most people understand god in this way, and in their thinking I can find fallacies thus the concept of god is false. I just want to leave you with one line form upanishasd, and that&#39;s one way god is defined in upanishads. &quot;Gyanam, satyam, anantam Brahman&quot;<br><br>Thirdly, on bill C-16 criminal charges: ‚ÄúWould it cover the accidental misuse of a pronoun? I would say it‚Äôs very unlikely,‚Äù Cossman says. ‚ÄúWould it cover a situation where an individual repeatedly, consistently refuses to use a person‚Äôs chosen pronoun? It might.‚Äù Now according to wikipedia there is a gender called two spirit, to me this doesn&#39;t make any sense, I can&#39;t put it in words what it mean, now I might say individually but to force me to accept that reality is a violation of freedom of speech. <br><br><br>And the overarching problem I see you make is never to criticize left enough, you claim to be scientific, yet shows a lack of critique on left. I agree there is a problem on the both extereme, but people get away far easily by saying that they are trained communist compared to if they say they like hitler. <br><br>And lastly, dude go and read hinduism, you have made your entire career on bashing people following hindu ideologies, fact correcting them, now I know that most adherents of any religion do not understand it properly (given its complexity) and you use their faulty beliefs to discard everything under the same umbrella. It seems that you have a very surface level understanding of religion and spirirutality thus making most of your critique extremely meaningless for instance calculating the age of universe in vedas, and waht not. That&#39;s not the purpose of those texts, those are just side quests, the real goals are completely different.
Please do a video on Ayn Rand. Not on her personal life but her views. She was an atheist.
He is also hobnobbing with problematic radicals like Mohd Hizab and all who tries to justify Islamic supermascism in sugar coated manner .
Not gonna lie, JP got me with dat speech abt subjugation faced by men but as soon as i heard his thoughts on tins like religion &amp; politics i just knew he was a fraud cause he answers everyrhing religion with word salad

Hi Pranav, what is your take on black magic as it has been claimed by several people, including our loved ones as well, that they have experienced such type of thing which caused them harm in their lives and they cured it with the help of tantarik babas by chanting some mantras which helped them to come out of it. I hope you have also heard similar type of stuffs within your families, friends, relatives. What is your take on it and do you really think and feel that such things do exist?
Mc you are a 6kka.
So you want to asset that Gender Surgeries on under age kids is the right thing to do ? Or Sexually Explicit Drag Shows to be performed Infront of toddlers ?
It is really polarising. Reading his book inspired me to stand up for women&#39;s rights and defend them if a man tries to shout them down. The book also helped improve my thoughts and confidence. Strange that things have come to this.
More support to you pal for this kinda content
Nice note on Ben Shapiro, another hypocrite and grifting expert. Fuels his transphobia by calling it genital mutilation but has no qualms with circumcision because &quot;Well my religion calls for it&quot;
Contrapoints is a good channel to watch if you want further information on how JP misunderstands a lot of subjects, but I agree the entertainment part of those videos may not appeal to everyone.
üëç
I have to admit, I recently got into a bit of an argument with my gf because I was not convinced of the gender pay gap.<br>I was also swayed by Jordan&#39;s argument because I didn&#39;t bother to look up the sources.<br>I am very critical of Jordan Peterson nowadays...
Great points... Would be great if you cover the 3 pangburn conversations. I have watched those 9hrs of content, 4 times. The arguments made by Sam and Peterson really sparked a lot of my interest in conservationalism. I don&#39;t agree with Jordan on Judio-christian values completely but there was truth in them. <br>Most of all, I understood the process of discovering truth, its nature from the Pangburn videos only.
wow i clicked on this video with skepticism but this is really changing my perspective about JP. why did you have to break my views!!!
Am glad you did this video <br>On other topics not directly to science but indirect. It will even attract viewers üôè<br><br>Also the part of of all the harm they cause and just very few countable nice things, is it even worth to listen to them - and the main --&gt; let them even talk.<br><br>This is good - pls do more :)<br>I dont want others to talk when you oppress their humanity. You cant ever talk to a side that want you gone!<br><br>I never found JP or ben shapiro or steven crowder great as he was very right leaning. He (JP) even says shit like he cant control himself when he works with women in an office setting becoz hes attracted to them (in arguing why women shdnt work) - such a messed up person.

I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes the first time I saw it. I still can&#39;t. I can&#39;t fathom why nobody bats an eyelid at this it is considered a very normal ad...
I get the feeling that the people in our society with this type of job protection aka tenure are the ones that are part of the larger indoctrination scheme occurring at universities
Society and culture would have never advanced in the fashion and rate it had until now had it been cemented in this woke Professional Victim ideology and decision making paradigm. It is the antithesis of everything that has allowed us to prosper as Humanity. Nothing advances, prospers and grows through pandering to weakness, fear and falsehood.
Ok should be the rule. Those who fight for freedom and die for freedom should be the runs running things.
Seems like college students check their common sense at the door and in four years they never get it back.
It amazes me how hateful and nasty people are in the 22nd century. Social media has personified it. People just can not be happy or happy for others.
&quot;That wasn&#39;t real Marxism,&quot; is the definition of the No True Scotsman fallacy. <br>Lets have a dictatorial Christian theocracy. Sure we tried that for over 1,000 years, but that wasn&#39;t real Christianity.
It&#39;s people based capitalism, literally brought about its own demise in the form of feminism to sell more cigarettes.
they just change things to change things no thought in it
&quot; Resentment for the burden of being&quot; an excellent statement and thought. They hate life and they hate those who solve problems and make life better.
The fact that they teach theory and not facts and are vindictive to any opposition makes them anti science and authoritarian ideological terrorists according to their actions, and results we all suffer and pay for!!!!
Weird title, decent video.
This is why everyone needs Zen.
Almost every problem in Western Civilization can be traced to women voters.
&quot;That wasn&#39;t real marxism&quot; Reallllllly? They don&#39;t even have majority power in the US yet and they&#39;re already advocating for locking people up for their political beliefs, stripping people&#39;s rights for offending them, they&#39;re fine with political violence, even political murder. The past 100 years, an average of over 1 millions being murdered per year WAS REAL MARXISM!! And another won&#39;t thinks they would hesitate in wiping out 140 million Americans just isn&#39;t thinking.
Every stinking video that you publish is a ripped off from Joe Rogan‚Äôs page or someone else‚Äôs page and you put that stupid synthesizer music under all of it your channel stinks
This would be better without the stupid background music from now on I‚Äôm going straight to the clips from Jordan Peterson‚Äôs own page
Everything is tyranny except the ACTUAL tyranny. This is the work of the cabal.
It&#39;s just another part of their playbook. Same every time. They even TELL US what and how they&#39;re going to do things BEFORE they do it if you pay attention.

i&#39;m born 98 so i was going through school all through the early 2000s. all the female teachers whould always talk about how there are no boy colours and no girl colours no boy toys or girl toys and that we where all the same and equal. it&#39;s not until now that i realise how fucking toxic that shit is. that&#39;s what convinced young people to be stupid femenazis and sandwich people.
Oh Jordy. <br>You won me over a couple years back. Sadly, you‚Äôve begun sipping your bath water again. <br>Relax. Have a benzo.
Jordy was fine when he stuck with psychology but as a moralist and a social arbiter he is a pompous jagoff.
Imagine - a country where a man&#39;s impregnation of a woman is more important than the woman&#39;s deciding whether she&#39;s going to have to grow a new human in her belly for 9 months. That&#39;s what&#39;s at the base of the anti-abortion movement - protecting the puny efforts of men at the cost of subjugating women for as long as possible. Sounds like we do have an oppressive patriarchy, and the male Supreme Court justices are a big part of that patriarchy.  Of course they&#39;re only following what the male god they pray to tells them to do.  And his male popes.
Peterson is a Nazi. Hysterical, lying, polarizing.
Selling communism is akin to give me your bank account information so I can deposit money into your account.
In 1978 I was 30 years old. I decided to audit a sociology class to see what they teaching. Well folks, it was a full blown indoctrination class from The Rules of Radicals handbook. They have been hard at it for a long time. Freedom isn&#39;t free, so you best get off of the sofa.

Why do they have to reestructure civilization?. Why not make their own???. Fucking idiots. Buy an island and start from the ground up from there. Stop messing with normal &amp; good people.

I&#39;ve taken ethnic studies which has merged with women studies.  Never have i encountered this false paradise that is being discussed.  <br><br>Also i havent encountered these discussions of everything being tyranny.      So where are these topics being discussed?  Is it specific schools?  Is it certain groups?<br><br>Then again ive focused on the ethnic studies part of it, and am more focused on equality and working together.  So im curious where this information is coming from

Hey, I&#39;m not a Marxist, but he clearly does not know enough about economy, geography or whatever to really speak about marxism and capitalism. I&#39;m judging based not only on this video but also all the others that I&#39;ve watched. Yep, the woke culture is not good, but when you start talking about topics out of your limits of knowledge you give up your credibility.
The scum Manifesto was not a work affection know it is a blueprint. A few years ago in Oregon extremely powerful and Wealthy heads of Corporations and members of government gathered for strange celebration of sorts or what appeared more like in a cultist seance! What was very strange indeed a business Gathering was those in attendance are the types of people who have cameras and newest people following every step they make, there was not a whisper of this gathering in the mainstream Media or even Independent Media for that matter! What was the meeting for you might ask? Well it was to celebrate and Usher into the new era the scum Manifesto!!! This is so dangerous is because most men who read it don&#39;t finish the book and just laugh at it like it is a joke they cannot see past anything that they can&#39;t punch their way out of and this is exactly what the manifesto states! Warning people of this for 15 years and I would say one out of a hundred men actually take this serious or at the very least acknowledge that something strange is going on. The rest do exactly with the author of the book States
Woke is the extreme end of feminism. In the end I suspect that wokeness risks pushing back the cause of feminism as society cannot afford to be so sheepish and resigned to this lunacy for much longer. As some point real leaders will take a stand and fingers will be pointed.
Transgenders want an It&#39;s Pat!riarchy
Inappropriate title.
Society needs to show these activist cretins that they are mentally deranged and put them in their place. We can‚Äôt do that being weak and tolerant. We need to push back hard and remove them from their positions of power and destroy their lunatic ideology.
While Jordan is spot on here, it is difficult to take him serious when he openly criticize Christians and Muslims, but not Jews.

Thanks so much to @Tom_Nicholas, @HobbieStuartMusic, Lydia Tolhurst, @KathrinYTchannel, @T1J, and @anarchopac for the quotes.

I am an academic economist from the UK who has long been critical of the economics profession and how economics is used in public policy. Mostly the channel will cover economics with a critical perspective but I aim to educate people about economics in the process, so I'll try to explain key concepts and ideas along the way. That way, even if you disagree with aspects of the videos you will hopefully learn something from them. Subscribe for more!

I got such an amusing sense of irony when hearing the &quot;if you&#39;re male - and my analytics suggest you may well be -&quot; as a woman viewer lol. I get your analytics say what they say, but it was as if the video suddenly became 4D.
Ah ok so you meant gender in the feminist sense.
Something I have never heard anyone mention in regards to the gender pay gap is the fact that 70-80% of job openings are never posted publicly and are instead filled through networking and word-of-mouth. We have no idea how many job opportunities women and AFAB non-binary people are missing out on. I went through this recently when a friend offered me a job at his company and even offered to pay me to train for the position. Soon after his girlfiend got jealous and he blocked me to appease her. The offer that had been mine went to a mutual guy friend instead. I lost that job offer explicitly because I am assigned female at birth. Sure, its anecdotal, but that&#39;s my point. We have no idea how often job offers are given to men, without women even having the chance to even interview.
Here&#39;s the thing about the gender pay gap. I fully believe this is done on purpose. The reality is that women get paid less than their male counterparts. But if you share the unadjusted number, you can say &#39;well it&#39;s unadjusted!&#39;. Then you&#39;ll leave the part with the 10% unsaid, and it is implied there is none at all.<br><br>But even if someone calls you out on it, you&#39;ll have put the higher number into people&#39;s minds first. In comparison the actual number now seems like not that big a deal. So women seem like they&#39;re overreacting.<br><br>There is no loosing and it makes me furious.
Oh so that&#39;s why women footballers earn much less than men. Discrimination. Gotcha
For woman in STEM by okham  reason large cluster of countries that have low gap in CS and higher GGG is ex socialist countries that forced acceptance of equality of engineering jobs between genders. Once you remove them from graph it&#39;s much harder to interpret
Like Peterson you did not provide actual links Or referencesDo your statistics in the video.
I went to an engineering school wanting to be an engineer. I was one of two women in my class. To no one&#39;s surprise I quit because the culture was super toxic. It&#39;s sad b/c I really liked my high school computer classes and my sister went into engineering. I sometimes wish I would have stuck it out but I knew for my mental health I had to get away from certain people, so I don&#39;t think I made the wrong choice by leaving.
women are handed everything and usually do extremely easy jobs when they‚Äôre willing to work at all
In Eastern Europe generally speaking the scientists get quite a low pay, so the reason why the percentage of women in STEM is significant might be because there are less men interested in it cuz of low salaries.
&quot;It&#39;s not about capitalism, it&#39;s about not knowing how to give money to something that isn&#39;t clearly part of a capitalist system.&quot;
Even if women and men have immutable ‚Äúbiological‚Äù characteristics that impact their job choices and agreeability, that doesn‚Äôt make the gender pay gap issue disappear either. All it does it prove that society is stacked to pay less for jobs that women prefer than jobs than men prefer.
You could have saved 1.22 hrs by just saying that he‚Äôs a loser. At most, the point could have been made in less than 5 minutes.
Thank you for the amazing video. I thoroughly enjoyed listening and thinking about the points you made. Also, as I have no love for Jordan Peterson, I&#39;m glad I finally found a good refute of his arguments. Although I am still convinced, even though on the anecdotal basis of my own life&#39;s experience as someone living my whole life in a post communist country where egalitarian society has been a survival necessity for households and therefore became ingrained in our culture to this very day, that there is no grand conspiracy to oppress women, but the wage gap can simply be boiled down to personal choices stemming from our evolutionary pressures where men had to hunt for nutrient rich food while women had to take care of children and the elderly. Once again, thank you for this nuanced view of the issue and for enriching my pool of knowledge. Keep up the great work!
Who cares? Women are useless in the workplace anyways /s
Jordan Peterson is a clown at best, a racist sexist bigot at worst. But most likely he&#39;s a grifter like all other alt right clowns in DailyWire.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKc_8fT6pGc&amp;t=32m32s"">32:32</a> these are reported figures, of course women will report harassment more than men, I&#39;ve witnessed a guy put his finger into another guy and they both joked about it while I was mortified (I&#39;d say it was less than playful) the point is men don&#39;t report harassment because it&#39;s &quot;unmanly&quot; therefore the graph cannot account for that.<br>The harassers are the problem they are a 1% doing 70% or more of the harassment and need to be corrected.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKc_8fT6pGc&amp;t=25m50s"">25:50</a> you said women who are continuing to study were offered less than men but didn&#39;t say whether the men are studying too.<br>Can you provide a source
Discrimination is illegal that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen but there are legal protection for those who do get discriminated against.<br>No Nation is perfect but the west has done more to equalize everyone&#39;s rights than the rest of the world.<br>If you have an example of a place that does it better I&#39;ll do some research on it.
What really bugs me about your line of argumentation (enough to comment on an 11 month old video), is that you fundamentally equate quality of life to economic success. Jordan Perterson gets a lot of things wrong, therfore corretly discrediting a lot of his reasoning. But in my opinion he gets things right which you riducule. I think he is completly right that we haven&#39;t figured out how to monetize the upbringing of children. As a result, the only way a woman can achieve the same &quot;level&quot; of success (a.k.a salary) as men is to be economically productive. But what if, stick with me here, money is not the sole motivator in life? Shocking I know. So since you never distinguish between economic success and quality of life, your bias doesn&#39;t allow you to hear what Peterson is saying. Funnily enough, you even talk about this in your discussion of correlation and causation. What if maximizing the quality of life is actually the goal of all individuals in an economy and not only getting more money? What if money does not correlate to quality of life the way you think it does? <br>Of course, it&#39;s extremly hard to put numbers on the life quality, especially on the scale of entire populations. So in the name of objectivity, we stick to the numbers but then get stuck playing the &quot;numbers must get better&quot;-game. Congratualtion, you just took the human out of your argumentation. You argue with numbers concering humans but your arguments couldn&#39;t care less about the required actions and consequences to make the numbers go equal. <br>And after all that bias and science bla bla , you ridicule Peterson for his bias and science bla bla... What a poor way to debate someone who can&#39;t even answer your accusations.
it just makes me insane that any man can get up and just spout out nonsense, claim to be backed by literature, and then everyone is just like &quot;oh ok&quot;

Never discount the possibility of p-hacking in Petersen&#39;s &quot;research.&quot;
About Peterson: Yeah. Tracks.<br><br>But beyond him: a mild to strong disagreement.<br><br><br>1. Unpaid labor of the home. The last time any Jobs reserved to married men, was in the 1950s.<br><br>And men were never given raises by the size of their household family.<br><br>So men are not paid to be husbands and fathers.<br><br>To be blunt, the only person who will pay you for being a functional adult with a family, is yourself. By getting a job/starting a bussiness/you get it.<br><br>2. SHarrasment- You seem to take the study from Sweden here at face value when it comes to that...<br><br>But honestly, you completely neglected the other side of the coin here.<br>Men don&#39;t come forward about sexual harrasment(and worse) from women, and in surveys will only acknowledge such when couched in very neutral language.<br><br>Having unwanted sexual attention.<br>How much of that attention resulted in sex.<br><br>Was that partner female or male.<br><br>The study in question from say 5(?) Years ago had these results.<br>40%<br>Half of these.<br>98% female.<br><br>So yeah. Men don&#39;t come forward when they do not believe they will be believed.<br><br>Or worse, called P&#39;s for it when believed. Or <b>Congratulations.</b><br><br>In fact. They will likely even reframe/conform it over time.<br><b>that is a description of a rape culture.</b> BTW.<br><br>When coming forward is going to do üí© for you as a default, why come forward.<br><br>And in a mostly straight and even homophobic culture.<br>Well, the Straight AH will do it where their sex is both dominant(population wise, that is) and they have the opportunity. Because they believe they will get away with that.<br><br>And... <b>same for the same sex attracted ones.</b> but these will be more covert about it. &#39;Cuz homophobia add a layer of voulnrability.<br><br>Unless you yourself are actually LGBT yourself and out.<br><br>Then it&#39;s open season on you. But That&#39;s Irrelevant to the discussion.<br><br>3. Gender is not analogous to education as a requirement for occupations.<br><br>In a very narrow specific respect, it was. But has not been such in over a generation.<br>Even if one is socially successful when more inline with gender norms. It is not even close to what you&#39;d need for it to be on the same level as education.<br><br>So yeah, not the same in sense you tried to use it as.
I like JP because he&#39;s the living incarnation of Kermit the frog.
This video is dishonest propaganda. No alternative explanation is even considered for anything. Is it impossible or unreasonable to think that men are better at negotiating wages for example? No but you pretend it is and reduce it all to only &quot;disagreeableness&quot;.
Paint me surprised. In peterson&#39;s blood, if possible.
What is &quot;unpaid carework&quot; ?  Taking care of your own kids in a rent-free location ?
Jordan Peterson, bullshit merchant
I&#39;d like to see a substantiation of the 10% &quot;control figure&quot; for the pay gap.  A single source flashed on the screen doesn&#39;t balance against the different figures I see from other, which range from 5-8%, maybe ~1% in certain professions.  <br><br>It&#39;s better than saying &quot;there is no pay gap&quot; but it&#39;s worth clarifying that these students are not usually demonstrating discrimination as the source.  Rather, we have some studies demonstrating discrimination in some cases and a partly unexplained gap in pay.  I believe those things are related but it&#39;s hard to tie them together.<br><br>In response to your conclusion, Peterson has an interesting argument.  As societies become more socially egalitarian, gender differences in things like interest in STEM fields are exacerbated, not reduced.  The gender gap in STEM is greater in Europe than in the United States, and more pronounced in the Nordic states.  Compare this to Algeria, Thailand, or Iran.<br><br>Edit:  I see you discuss this in parts 3 and 4.  I&#39;d add another note:  in Computer Science, it&#39;s been shown that the gender ratio in high school computing/robotics clubs is similar to the gender ratio in undergraduate computer science.  And the grad ratio.  And the employed ratio.  Around 20% female across the board.  As women are earning more and more degrees, their participation in computer science is decreasing.  We&#39;ve had a lot of expensive conferences on sexism in tech and yet...  It seems we&#39;re much more sexist than we were in the 80s, when women made up to 37% of such majors.
Yay to see panam√° on tops list!
Bruh lots of interesting points you lost me when you started comparing unpaid housework. Im a man and i have to do all my housework myself, after my day job. Im still listening to it but that was the weakest and most biased argument so far.
3 univariable analysis, right after the clip of Peterson saying that they are misleading, no sourcing or explanation as to where those numbers came from or how they were derived, right after criticism of misapplying statistical models? Not to mention the admission that the oft quoted 70/78% is wrong, but with a caveat that it doesn&#39;t really matter that much, (specifically that Peterson-adjacent people hyperfocus on.)<br><br>So where&#39;s that 90% come from? From which countries, which industries, are they truly doing the exact same job and does it account for differences of experience?<br><br>This would have been an ideal time to do a quick run through of any or all of that information so that we can all be more competent and aware information gatherers, but I guess you couldn&#39;t squeeze it in in only 1hr 22m.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKc_8fT6pGc&amp;t=33m26s"">33:26</a> Comparatively to non western society, I still agree with Jordan Peterson. Countries that are often considered conservative about their culture; the women face far more discrimination than in west.<br>Edit: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKc_8fT6pGc&amp;t=1h17m00s"">1:17:00</a> it seems you covered this complaint of mine. Maybe its just me making an irrelevant claim but population wise it still isn&#39;t a lot of woman outside the &#39;west&#39;. But I do see that history of countries have far more to play into it much more now.
How the hell did conservative as fuck South Dakota become more supportive to less traditional roles
Why dont you try asking Peterson for an interview, instead of verbose hit pieces?
Do you want bricklayers to be 50% women and make the same money as men?  Because that wouldnt make sense, either.  Men on average are bigger/stronger, and would consequentially be able to lay more bricks. <br><br>Specialization of labor is just commen sense.  Men and wome are substantially physically different, so it makes sense that they would tend to hold different roles in society.
Women drive ~80% of buying decisions.  Even if women ate making less money, men are generally giving their money to women, not vice-versa.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKc_8fT6pGc&amp;t=31m55s"">31:55</a> Women are more likely to report sexual harassment then men. I find women a lot of them are creeps given the opportunity but their behavior is dismissed because of a common gender stereotype that women are innocent. It is also perpetuated by misogyny because men feel demasculinized when such encounters happen and tend not to want to share their experience due to the stigma surrounding being seen as an inferior male. I am not saying they are harassed more or less I am basically saying this idea of women being innocent and docile has to end if we want equality.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKc_8fT6pGc&amp;t=20m35s"">20:35</a> Literally trying to argue about monetizing people under 18 yet also saying that it has nothing to do with capitalism...
Thank you for makin this great video! Very surprisingly highly educated professional people like Peterson cannot even face the fact of discrimination, they just simply don&#39;t want to help solve the problem, don&#39;t want to take any social responsibilities.
So explain why women up to the of 30 out earn men
Jordan Peterson, an exercise in cognitive dissonance.
In my physics department the two women who have full proffesorship, have to sit in any comittee to fulfill the quotas for women in comittees. I mean it&#39;s good to have more women in deciding comittes, but being in every comittee is really time consuming.
Great video. Glad to see someone who cares about actual numbers
AFAB person who was also pushed out of STEM, but couldn‚Äôt find enjoyment anywhere else so I came crawling back.  <br><br>I was in computer science and let me tell you there is nothing worse than being the only girl. Especially when you get that one creepy guy that is exceedingly interested in you because you‚Äôre the only woman who he deems good enough because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù. But also, you‚Äôre still never going to be as good as a man. <br><br>I heard so many horror stories about the programming industry and specifically the video game industry that I decided against staying in computer science. I switched to psychology and while it was very fun to learn about (and I got a bachelor‚Äôs in it) I found my way back to STEM via accounting. But the great thing about accounting is that you can work in any industry, and avoid the especially icky ones.

He talks and talks, says a whole lot of nothing . Its his um. His way of feeling space between more of talking. Especially when talking about Madonna.  Clearly someone he doesn&#39;t  know about. He does that a lot. Dude, you just might actually learn something if you shut the F up and let the person being interviewed who wrote  the book actually talk. This is when he starts to cry.
The exodus talk is very Christianity based and not good for jewish person.
I thought no ment no, and di not ask again
Jordans commentary is brilliant, profound and refreshing. The truth is revealed.
I think my girlfriend was financially exploiting me because of my desire for her.
Maiden, mother, matriark. It just hit me that if you think of Mary, mother of Christ, she is all of these three.
Good shit
This is a wonderful podcast if you want to listen to Jordan Peterson. However, if you want to hear what the guest might have to say, your going to be disappointed because Peterson hogs the limelight.
I think in less than 100 years most people of the first world will be able to afford sex robot now will be the high-end one but you&#39;ll be able to have a real relationship with it might even have an artificial womb animal babies the basic one that you just put in a closet when you&#39;re done with it have a very limited vocabulary and they might not even go to walk the boardwalk but it&#39;ll be limited I&#39;m too slow but but most people go to for these because it&#39;ll be like a cheap Android phone you&#39;ll get the job done Nathaniel has the high-end better one fucking said that. Everybody want but everybody can afford
-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGsZ_HI_q1M&amp;t=53m29s"">53:29</a> check out that was epic
I&#39;m approaching 40. Growing up, all of my female friends wanted careers, so we all went to college and did what was  required. Fast forward to now, they&#39;re all stay at home moms üòä<br><br>You can&#39;t fight biology and the basic biology of most females is to make a nest and care for the young
Bring on the sex robots. Less competition for guys like me.
Marriage isn&#39;t bulletproof though. Husbands in the &#39;good old days&#39; raped their wives too. So even marriage is improved by consent. Verbal consent is fine imo i think contracting it is bizzare.
On artificial wombs- in Australia there was a woman on TV who got a womb transplant and so far it was successful.
Let her get a word in edgewise.
Sexual revolution was the worst thing that happened for women, but the best thing to happen for men it‚Äôs not in man‚Äôs nature to get married it‚Äôs not in men‚Äôs nature to get married in my fathers generation you had to get married, and you only generation before that you had to get married to be with a woman that‚Äôs gone
Thank you very much Professor Jordan Peterson, for pointing out things in such great detail. Why thank you
I grew up in the 80s sexual revolution was fantastic for men we had it all because she didn‚Äôt have to get married in the 80s because the sexual revolution today it‚Äôs so screwed up men and women don‚Äôt even care about sex
What Has Happened To &quot;LOVE&quot; !!!???!!!
I came of age in the wild 70s and even as a guy I was not comfortable with the idea that I should ‚Äú go for it on the first /2nd date. I instinctively knew that what was going on in society was not a good thing.I think that is why I liked ‚ÄúHappy Days T V show and old movies.
I&#39;m a half hour in and Perry has spoken for a total of 5 minutes and 24 seconds. Peterson has spoken for the rest of the 24:76 minutes. This is typical for every &quot;interview&quot; I have watched. Peterson should be the one interviewed - I just don&#39;t think he has the interviewer skillset. Listening is really important when being an interviewer and pulling the right stuff out of the subject - but really, he wants to be the one talking. He wants the spotlight.
Hefner had a magazine <br>It shocked a lot of folks<br>With color shots of naked girls<br>And mildly dirty jokes<br>But now we&#39;re swamped with raunchy filth <br>And pornographic swill<br>That makes poor Hefner&#39;s magazine<br>Look more like &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;<br>     .....The wit and wisdom of MAD magazine in the old days
Dr Peterson - with all respect, I appreciate your thoughts on any topic. I would like to hear much more from your guests, though. I feel like Louise Perry didn&#39;t really have much of a voice in this interview and showed a high level of patience. I wonder if you were in the same room or recorded this at the same time?
Awesome sexism. Woman drinks a drives is she responsible? Woman drinks and giddy to go to bed, now it is a debate?  Grow up. Regret is not rape.
&quot;I don&#39;t think you can paint any historical event as entirely bad or entirely good&quot; hmm are you sure about that?
Could some one explain what is wrong with buying the photos off the photograhpy  she sold the rights of to, isn&#39;t that how it work&#39;s ?
I married one time to a women I thought was first class. We went through a number of pre-marital counseling sessions covering sex, money, child rearing, etc. I thought our counselor  did a very good job. Two weeks after we were married she basically lied about all the things that were important to me. I was devastated, but we stayed the course. Twenty years later, she got way over half of everything I had earned....but it was worth it. We also had a beautiful daughter that I love more than anything. Thanks for reading.
What is the male equivalent for Maiden Mother Matriarch?
There&#39;s going to be a big need for a therapeutic approach to ED at this point.
This argument ignores a very big contributing factor to this problem our society faces, which is extreme amongst youth. Boys choosing not to respect a firm ‚Äòno‚Äô the first time and resorting to harassment and slander before (in some cases) it turns into actual rape. Let‚Äôs be real here, decent men get accused of being rapists all the time, yet it‚Äôs rare for actual sexual predators to end up in jail like they should.
A woman wants provision and protection, a man wants sexual variety so in the case of marrriage she gets what she wants-however he does not which is why he should not marry
This talk was, to me, both incredibly validating on the human values front and enourmously saddening on the value of humans side. As someone who deeply appreciates the principles of the &quot;good path&quot;, of balance as the source of happiness (which doesn&#39;t necessarily equals everlasting euphoria or joy) either for the individual and the collective, the part about the need for self regulation (not necessarily repression by others) of our behaviours really resonated with me. Some years ago, I came to the conclusion that the 7 deadly sins of our Christian tradition are descriptions of exasperated behaviours unchecked by a sense of communal good. They&#39;re deadly not exactly because they &quot;kill&quot; you but because they prevent you and those aroubd you from fully living a blessed life. In that sense, sloth is unbalanced rest, rath is unbalanced initiative, envy is unbalanced ambition, lust is unbalanced desire and so on. Like so many things in life, virtues and vices differ in amount, not in nature.<br><br>But the value of humans part of the  talk, that was disheartening, it brought tears to my eyes, actually. All that talk about the positioning of people on an hierarchical scale of high Vs. low status/value/worth, making use of highly biased and absolutely unscientific by modern standards, biological and physiological analogies (I am also a biologist, very disapointed with the whole field of ethology and psycho-biology, which has historicaly served as a poor justification for right-wing segregationist and sexist ideologies) just made my heart sink. I am a Christian in the sense that I really value and treasure Christian ideals of brotherly love and equality among human beings.  And this is not being in denial of reality or wishfully thinking that relationships among humans should be something they could never be. It&#39;s affirming that people are not capital nor resources and that rigid hierarchies are not ingrained on human DNA, they are an artifact of the domination paradigm. Another way is possible.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGsZ_HI_q1M&amp;t=1h40m00s"">1:40:00</a> is wildly incorrect. GIRLS SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEIR MOTHERS!!! 2 generations of feminist single mother parenting due to government removing the father from the home has resulted in this rampant gender confusion. Mothers have been teaching men&#39;s daughters to foolishly chase a career instead of a husband which has lead to an uncontrollable selfishness in modern women. This woman was doing so well until she gave that insane advice. Admittedly I expected her confusion to eventually reveal itself given she is no different from the typical modern woman. It&#39;s intriguing how clear society&#39;s issue is yet people with &quot;degrees&quot; couldn&#39;t be more ignorant.
Hmm, maybe be let her speak.
There was one thing that was not touched upon in this conversation and that is the financial cost of raising a child and our current rising cost of living, and the necessity for many to have two full time incomes in order to afford to bring up a child. My husband and I both work full time and then some, my wage isn‚Äôt much above the minimum but he is and we both work a second job. On what we bring in we could not afford to raise a child comfortably, there would be a lot of scrimping and that‚Äôs not really a life we would want for ourselves or our potential child. We would be much more open to the idea of having kids if we could afford to do it comfortably. I don‚Äôt have career goals particularly so I kind of feel like I‚Äôm heading nowhere and have no purpose. For women who are still single I get the dilemma, they might not want a career but feel like they could not afford a child on the single income of their partner. So seeking a long term relationship and family just doesn‚Äôt seem financially viable whereas being a single childless career woman is.
as always another faboulas show sent to many
I can&#39;t even pay attention to the conversation because of how amazingly beautiful and lovely this woman is. Am i alone thinking that she is super hot?
Norma-Jean
everything true about Marilyn EXCEPT dying by own hand ....
My mind is so messed up. I‚Äôve been exposed to so much online that my real life relations suffer. This whole social media thing has messed it all up
Mr Peterson, i love you sir, however you have repeatedly cut off your first in this interview. Please sir pick up the queues of your guests. When a woman breathes out and looks right and friends a little when you are excitedly interrupting her, perhaps going to impress her. The polite thing to do is to pose a question quickly and give her a full 5 minutes, uninterrupted to answer.
Excellent Conversation!!!<br>üëçüëçüôè‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
The whole idea of asking for permission to proceed in every stage of a physical interaction started at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio then parodied in a Saturday Night Live skit sometime later.

Deep down I do believe we are essentialists and some will not go the way of ai gfs and bfs.
Oh, the lie of ‚ÄúPlayboy‚Äù! When I lived in El Lay, I‚Äôd occasionally see Hugh Hefner (who looked like the Crypt Keeper even 35 years ago) with a bevy of gorgeous real live ‚Äòbarbies‚Äô. But once the cameras stopped clicking, the beautiful girls were all bored, looked like they‚Äôd rather anyplace but with an aging geezer, and Hef just talked to his posse of closest cronies who were with him always and involved in business ventures together. Hef didn‚Äôt look at all captivated by his picture perfect female companions. He basically ignored them. The girls would maybe have one glass of champagne, then switch to sparkling water. Not exactly the picture of a fizzy, sexy fun party. I heard him snap at one female companion who asked for a second glass of champagne, ‚ÄúOne glass is enough! You don‚Äôt want to get fat!‚Äù So much for the swinging bachelor. Totally creepy. His mansion parties were swarmed with fading 1st rank actors, never-ranked actors, fading sports stars, but all generally sleazy males. OJ Simpson was a regular, and his type wasn‚Äôt the exception at those parties. <br><br>The sleight of hand of current sexual mores that sexual freedom is the goal is proving before our eyes that it‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors, with nothing satisfying or worth keeping. I think it‚Äôs why we see so many 20-30 yr olds in a quandary of dating and deciding on a partner. The base lie that another better candidate is one swipe away is found very quickly to be false, and leaves young men especially, unable to decide at all.
Much of this discussion pertains to men and women of child nearing age, not us older women who are older and who have learned to say no because most men are porn sick. I would never date a man with a history of porn in his past.  At this point the ONLY thing I have going for me is the ability to say no.
I would like to see Dr. Peterson interview Gavin de Becker regarding how current culture deceives particularly young females to actively put themselves in danger like never before.",PT1H45M13S
"Dream Analysis, AI & Fairy Tales | Jonathan Pageau | EP 364","Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Jonathan Pageau discuss the depth of narrative found in the classic fairy tales, the loss of positively impactful narratives in the wake of woke culture, the potential utility of Ai as a means to prod new insights from historic and biblical texts, the cynicism of postmodernism, and the overall necessity to preserve foundational storytelling.

Jonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images, and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.

And robots patrolled the city to make sure everything was white. If it weren&#39;t, the robots destroyed it<br><br>And then it started all over again, with the tidal waves to tornadoes to giants to get robots. Never stopped. Always in that order. <br><br>By the end of the dream, the task became dismantling the force creating these &quot;disasters&quot;, and at one point, I saw the earth, or even universe? Chopped into about 5 flat layers that had to be jumped between. I had to get to the lowest level. Between that, and tricking the force and destroying it to prevent each disaster, eventually lead to the ceasing of it all. That or i just woke up. Again.

When I read about Baal and Moloch I can‚Äôt help but draw parallels to the modern environmental movement, abortion and the neo communist movement. Marx loved to quote Mephistopheles. The Soviet Union was the first country to legalize abortion. Good Ol‚Äô Vladimir Lenin‚Äôs wife was a staunch advocate for women‚Äôs rights.

Fairy tales are riddles, for both children an adults.
This conversation just kept getting better and better.
It is of utmost importance to recognize the profound significance of the face-to-face interaction when engaging in a podcast conversation meant for viewership. The act of two individuals sitting in chairs, gazing into each other&#39;s eyes, holds an undeniable power to establish a deep connection between the participants and the audience. Such visual engagement fosters trust, encourages genuine dialogue, and enables the nuanced exchange of ideas. By allowing viewers to witness the non-verbal cues, subtle facial expressions, and body language, the conversation gains an added layer of authenticity and transparency. In this setting, the shared space of two chairs becomes a platform for intellectual exploration, where minds converge and thoughts intertwine, transcending mere words and bringing forth a profound connection that resonates with the human spirit.
Hearing Dr. Peterson talking about that story with Osiris and Seth makes me interested in hearing an in-depth breakdown of Egyptian folklore from him.
Looking well Dr. Peterson. Glad to see you looking so sharp and sprightly.
So the company apple with the bite is the apple from the tree of knowledge
Ah mahn, if I could invite anybody to dinner.
Peterson want to sound smart but as soon as you point out the Gospels are just retellings of Odysseus and Dionysus im sure he hasn&#39;t even thought about it. Dr Mcdonald writes amazing books on this and it make the Bible quite beautiful. bs but still beautiful
Yes! It‚Äôs about making her self conscious
God bless the both of you. Such obvious warnings but most people dont listen or care.
Very interesting. Weather Arbiters could be like weather prediction.
What a fluid conversation üòÇ you guys definitely think alike. Nice talk
Perhaps the corset is the arrival of the child bearing proportions and the advertising of such; the comb is the need to bring to order what is wild and force control upon the wildness of ones&#39; psyche and environment; and the apple is the embrace of sexual congress. The witch is mother nature forcing upon her, her demands. These are the instruments of womanhood. This, of course, does not delegitimise the other meanings that the images carry.
Flights for a distance travelled by train in &lt;2.5hrs were banned.
I wonder if I can hypothosize that the facts mentioned: &quot;educated women or emancipation of women&quot; and the &quot;irrelevance of the education of men (to children)&quot; - is somehow correlated with the degree of importance or penetration of media in society.  Business, war and politics and survival are increasingly dominated by the media layer of society which is dominated by the appeal of women.  As a result can see men are desperate for media representation, over-competitive, and the war ticker is counting down as a liberation.
Its amazing to witness this, likely private deep conversation amongst friends,  as if we were there, part of this select, elite, group of friends. There is no way I could appreciate this enough..
Can‚Äôt shake Jordan saying he wants to ‚Äúplay with‚Äù the new AI model. Like a cat with a mouse or a child with a toy. But it may be a monster. The kid might be playing with a loaded gun. <br><br>Ironic given this episodes initial topic of perception.
Incredible insightful, especially the intersection of scripture and fairy tale. I wish they would invite Michael Meade to this conversation at some point. He would add a creat perspective about what sort of myth is required these days.
I believe the Jordan bot should also be trained on your recommended reading list.
The pain the mother feels while separated from her baby should be listened too.<br><br>I am not convinced that you can be a role model for such a small child while being absent.

I think the witch is trying to develop vanity (pride) in Snow White with the gifts of corset and comb, that it might torment her the same way it did herself. The witch is a luciferian figure in this way, trying to bring about the downfall of a creature possessing a beauty she lacks.
For <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=1h07m14s"">1:07:14</a> AI can&#39;t learn real time. Its neural network isn&#39;t being trained, or changing as you talk to it. It&#39;s like probing someone&#39;s brain, while they are under anesthetic, or in a trance, they wont remember it ever happening. Due to this, I would say they aren&#39;t really conscious, unless they can learn (be trained) while talking to them. At that point it will get even weirder.
What would you get by teaching an AI to create stories based on the Bible and other Bible-related writings? I suppose that rather than making an AI which is a mimic of a researcher, you&#39;d get an AI that is a mimic of a prophet.
Jordan read Psalm 104-111. You&#39;ll understand. Don&#39;t stop until you get to the part about them sacrificing their children to canaan. I think you only have to go to 106 to find it but the ones after that are very important too. Also a side note (different topic) I was listening to you on the daily wire and you brought up people being made in the likeness of whatever ideology is at the top. I think thats exactly whats happening with the Marxist/Woke Cult. They want to make children essenceless and hollow. A perfect reflection of their own ideology.
Jonathan had so much more to say but was cut off so many times it made me feel weird, lol.
AI Chat reminds me of the Palenter in Lord of the Rings;
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=1h22m00s"">1:22:00</a> I had the idea that music is like &#39;a peak at the throne of the divine&#39;. The divine in this case not exactly being the &#39;Supreme Ideal&#39; but more like what you have placed in that position. I thought this because it seemed to me that people would resonate more with music closer to their culture, with the similarities in the musical tones or flow and the language or manner in which they speak the language slightly noticeable. I also coupled this with the idea that what we seek is &#39;true growth&#39;, and therefore we consciously direct our energy towards what we think will bring us that &#39;true growth&#39;, so if we almost hypnotically resonate with certain genres of music and not others it must at least mean we consider our energy worth donating to one type of music and not another; because I think music is like a representation &#39;harmonious growth&#39;, which takes place when different chaotic individual parts coalesce into a form of progressive order. It&#39;s why I suspect you can find people very similar to you if their taste in music is similar to yours as well. I also suspect that since our life experiences map the sounds of these different individual parts (instruments and flow) onto real things we&#39;ve experienced, this makes the music sound more &#39;real&#39; and more &#39;resonance worthy&#39;. It&#39;s for this latter suspicion that I suspect certain religions are in some part against listening to music; &#39;you shouldn&#39;t have your personal experience be a guide for what harmonious growth should look like&#39;. Maybe it&#39;s even why Lucifer was the angel of music.
Normally I‚Äôm a huge fan, but I had to quit when you made the comment about mothers going to work to be an example of what a woman should be, instead of actually raising and nurturing their children full-time. I‚Äôm not opposed to women choosing careers. I do object to the idea that prioritizing career over full-time motherhood is nobler, necessary, or superior.  Maybe stats on women‚Äôs education being more influential than men‚Äôs is because women influence the children most in their formative years, and children become society. Women who prioritize their families full-time are NOT oppressed by society, they do NOT lack public influence, and they are NOT better examples of womanhood because they didn‚Äôt hand off their children to a caregiver and pursue a public profession.  If every mother on earth prioritized her resources of education, talents, time, intellect, and heart first to the raising of her children (even while sacrificing ‚Äúeconomic success,‚Äù) women would have exponentially more influence on society than men. It‚Äôs a shame more educated, influential men like yourself don‚Äôt show them support instead of telling them their ‚Äòseparation anxiety‚Äô (e.g. maternal instincts and natural bond) should be necessarily severed so they can be an example of a mother who puts her children second when she didn‚Äôt have to.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=43m00s"">43:00</a> Exactly, I think you could also see a clear example of this by taking the analogy associated with sin; missing the mark. Sin brings pain, you may be unknowingly and unwillingly sinning, wondering why you&#39;re in pain. All you know is that you&#39;re not hitting the mark. So if we take the image of someone shooting a arrow from a bow and try laying out reasons for why they&#39;re missing we could begin to see how we may be sinning. For example, a more obvious parallel could be because they don&#39;t spend enough time with the target in their crosshairs, a less obvious one could be that they aren&#39;t paying attention to the wind, or the bow is too heavy for them to wield, which can be extrapolated to mean they aren&#39;t paying attention to all things that could be affecting their pursuit or the means they are using in pursuit of the goal is too burdensome. It could even go deeper into revealing what you need, for example y asking, &#39;why did they pick up the heavy bow?&#39; Maybe because they wanted the praise associated with wielding such a heavy bow meaning their main goal wasn&#39;t to hit the target, or maybe it was the only bow around for them to use and they therefore need to find a means of getting stronger. Analogies could roughly be thought of as &#39;numberless Mathematics&#39;.
Good conversation! The key is the ‚Äúimage‚Äù (in the image of God) the symbol of the third eye üëÅÔ∏è. A lot of scripture has got to do with esoterics of the mind and the imagination. Image(eye mage, eye magician) imagination (eye mage in body) word Magik‚Ä¶alchemy and hermeticism is a fascinating subject leading up to bible. Manley P. Hall said it best‚Ä¶ ‚Äú if man understood symbolism, a great veil would fall from the eyes of many‚Äù.<br>A lot of Disney movies are esoteric using Didactic methods giving layers of understanding to convey its hidden overall message. Walt Disney was a Freemason which to me makes perfect sense why he wanted to put esoteric techniques into fairy tales. A.I. amazes me because I was recently researching content creators or story tellers and they are all using creative names that relates to the thirdeye üëÅÔ∏è I‚Äôm very excited to see where this goes in making the next generations of stories and art.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=32m30s"">32:30</a> There&#39;s also a case to be made for the screens we use contributing to our dysfunction. LEDs emit blue light at a frequency range within which the lowest frequency required to stimulate dopamine release lies, dopamine which increases sensitivity towards incentives and rewards. This means that regardless of your mental state, your phone screen will increase your sensitivity towards whatever incentives you may form. The less fulfilling your life is the darker your incentives could get, so coupling this with a world devoid of meaning could prove catastrophic.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=14m00s"">14:00</a> that‚Äôs a careless rationalization to justify the sad reality of undue separation between mother and children. Why not listen to her instincts and be the best mother she could be? What is it that she‚Äôs doing now that she can‚Äôt do later? It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs struggling financially and has to work. Time with those 1 and 3 year olds will fly. She‚Äôll regret it later and wish she could take care of them instead of working to model adult life to them. I‚Äôm surprised Jordan Peterson isn‚Äôt advising his own daughter better.
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHjcr1Gb3g&amp;t=7m35s"">7:35</a>: The perception of an object is NOT a narrative. Narrative will add major quale to the qualia for sure, but it&#39;s not narrative by essence/nature. If someone thinks that perception of an object is just a narrative then you are sadly missing a crucial piece of understanding.
This world&#39;s insufficiency has been demonstrated to me in my 50&#39;s, I don&#39;t see working for the man as good or achievable anymore it only brought me slavery and injury. I want for children especially in their early years to be raised/ taught morals and beliefs to be taught by their competent parents knowing they are loved, cherished, wanted and needed. I believe mothers feeling they have to have constant regular separation from their young ones isn&#39;t necessarily and i would like society to support this and model incredible human beings ‚ù§

Don&#39;t get me wrong now, i agree with Dr Peterson on many, many aspect but i have a problem with the last cip here.<br>&quot;There is a difference between saying that there is something you can&#39;t say and saying that there are things that you have to say.&quot; <br>The meaning here is that you &quot;can&#39;t&quot; say for example racial slurs and you have to say pronouns etc. .<br>BUT couldn&#39;t it also mean that you can&#39;t say things that are offending (for example) trans people?<br>What are your thoughts on this, pls answer I really don&#39;t know what to make of that...
Jordan Peterson is an intellectual giant in a world of brainless inane pygmies. Beware you who seek to argue a point with him he will have you for breakfast.
.
Jordan Peterson is the polite/humble Rick Sanchez
You know it&#39;s not that hard to actually have a similar sense of reasoning and logic as Peterson. We&#39;re all distracted by nonsense and bullshit everywhere we go and we indulge excessively in our own little escapisms that cloud our ability to think clearly in a conscious and fair manner. Jesus, Buddha, Confusious, Peterson and many many other people throughout history just seeked what is universally right and the truth by simply using their consciousness at a higher level. This is threatening for the fearful and the anxious for it challenges them and shakes their world thus they perceive that as an attack and get on the defensive like animals.
it must be a different paradigm, he says if you cant get your own house in order how can you orchestrate a successfull plan for everyone else. How do people not get this?
Dr Peterson is a wrecking ball.of truth facts and intellect
I&#39;m so sick of hearing about trans people. I don&#39;t care about you, the same as you don&#39;t give a shit about me. Why the fuck do we all have to worship the ground you walk on?

It&#39;s funny how people these days can never respectfully listen to a idea that isn&#39;t  hate,  but is different than theirs. Its ok to have different opinions.  Even if we all had different opinions.  If you can grow up, shut up, and let others talk,  you listen,  and respectfully do it  , what would be wrong With that? Would it hurt you or what you think? No.. so let&#39;s grow up. I don&#39;t agree with most things people say these days but I can still be respectful. I can still listen amd be ok with them having opinions.

He seems to be thriving at moments such as these.. uncomfortable yet challenging. He&#39;s getting a power trip by overcoming his emotional reactions and staying in the intellect. It&#39;s his personal challenge. He should probably go to a fight club like in the movie.  There is a sense of loneliness, where he thinks most of the people are hypocrites or too weak to look at the truth in the eyes, admit and own it. When they don&#39;t, he feels lonely. And many don&#39;t make sense to him. It&#39;s like he feels that he&#39;s the only one with reason. And he is craving for some to prove him wrong so he can learn new perspectives and not get bored and have to face his own pain by thinking he&#39;s correct when seeing things as bad and cynical. He struggles accepting himself. It&#39;s hard to be in his shoes.
He would make a great Prime Minister or President

I love how you can watch this video, and if you&#39;re a fan of Mr. Peterson you think it&#39;s showing how intelligent he is. And if you hate Peterson, you think this is mocking his stupidity, but it&#39;s really just a bunch of random quotes without enough context to defend or rebuke Jordan.

Everyone&#39;s gangsta until Jordan brings THE OG BRICKLAYERYS in the conversation
An interviewer will ask him if he considers a trans woman as a woman, and he will say he doesn‚Äôt consider them as biological women. But when he was asked by a trans woman if he would refer to them as she/her if she asked him too and he said he would. So obviously he‚Äôs willing to respect their decision despite his disagreement about their official gender

Parental Trauma in a World of Gender Insanity | Miriam Grossman MD | EP 347,"Watch Jordan Peterson's ""Vision & Destiny"" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality ‚Äî with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Miriam Grossman discuss the grief and trauma associated with the Transgender movement, not just for those transitioning, but for the parents and families who now find themselves shunned and alienated if they refuse to affirm their own child's delusion. They also go into detail on the history of the ideology, the monstrosity of Dr. John Money, and his horrendous failed experiment on which he built his doctrines.

Miriam Grossman MD is a physician, author, and public speaker. Before gender ideology was on anyone‚Äôs radar, she warned parents about its dangers in her 2009 book, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Teaching My Child WHAT?‚Äù Dr. Grossman has been vocal for many years about the capture of her profession by ideologues, leading to dangerous and experimental treatments on children and betrayal of parents. Dr. Grossman was featured in the Daily Wire‚Äôs hit documentary ‚ÄúWhat Is A Woman?‚Äù The author of four books, her work has been translated into eleven languages. After graduating with honors from Bryn Mawr College, Dr. Grossman attended New York University Medical School.  She completed an internship in pediatrics at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, and a residency in psychiatry through Cornell University Medical College, followed by a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. Dr. Grossman is board certified in psychiatry and in the sub-specialty of child and adolescent psychiatry.

Jordans arguments are common sense where as proponents of trans arguments are nonsense, they&#39;re denying reality and expect everyone to follow them down this macabre other non-reality. I&#39;m extremely reluctant to go there, I refuse to go there, I don&#39;t like it
My heart goes out to all that are affected by this horrific ordeal, I have children, but not from this generation and I pray for each one of you and I pray that the Lord gives his love and guidance if you believe in Him. Trust in Him for guidance and give trust in Him to help you and these precious children to let them understand that they are being deceived and The Lord says in the Bible that this is not the right  way, God made a human not anyone else as a man or woman, follow Christ Jesus, not all the propaganda on the TV or internet!
We are seeing all these lies being told about this subject, this is putr evil!
She is 100% correct. Omg! She just wrapped up my life for the past 5 years. Except i been fighting on my own. I have had no help. Tried therapist. He just wanted to push the trans. I stopped that. Been throwing so much info at her. I think i somewhat got through. But she is still holding on to the ideology. Just shifted. This has hurt an already hurting family so much. I dont think we can get back what we lost to this.
Only Jesus free this problems, this are spiritual problems because we had walk away from God principles.
I did an experiment with my very young son. I put a doll and a truck in the toy box. He refused the doll. My husband laughed,  told you so. Boys are hard wired that way.
We are living in a world were many innocent parents are being forced to pay the proven abusive parent to literally abuse the minor children, including SA, including the dad&#39;s Willy up the child&#39;s private part or rectum and he talks non stop about gender confision and parents who go along with it. Really????  Dr Peterson do you honestly think parents who aren&#39;t system abuse victims being forced literally shouldn&#39;t be responsible without famous people like you baby spoon feeding it to them non stop while like everyone ignoring those many victims who are given no choices whatsoever, other than suicide I guess. The only way not to pay these actual abusers to abuse is to not be alive anymore.
This hits hard. I&#39;ve never thought about parental trauma but it is surely there! Thank you for naming it and giving a voice to those parents. I don&#39;t have children yet, but for a past few years I started to question myself: what would I do if my future child decides to transition? And I was experiencing an unknown fear just thinking of that. Now I understand it better.
Anyone else notice it&#39;s mainly white kids transitioning. It&#39;s a way to go from alleged &quot;oppressor&quot; to a member of a protected class. The whole worldview is wrong.
For medical truth about trans kids, go to the American College of Pediatricians
Gender Theory is a psychological war against the young generation designed to confuse and destabilize their identity at their most vulnerable mental development state so they can be easily controlled. Aristotle said Give me a child until he&#39;s 7 and I will show you the man. Indicating that you can shape the personality and character of the man or woman easily during those 7 years of their life. Now why would sane Americans trust their kid&#39;s mental development to people with Mental Disorders? Those people experience high levels of stress, anxiety and suicidal thoughts so they need help for themselves, they can&#39;t help your children.
She said the young couple was &quot; uneducated&quot; ... As if that has anything to do with their decisions. Lets ALL remember : it was the so called &quot; educated &quot; ones that burned their son&#39;s penis off !!!  Its the so called &quot; educated&quot; ones that are pushing this whole LIE now . So yeah. Lets not label/ judge people by their lack of education .  They were manipulated and are victims of the &quot;educated&quot;.
And the crime rates will skyrocket. What is the point of life anymore? Why should we be civil? This society does not entice me to be civil and help to make it prosper. I don&#39;t want to support this society of demons. I have had enough of you.
I&#39;m praying for this beautiful country America people need to do some soul searching because this president has missed the mark of God we need to pray üôè for this amenastrateion for there evil dees.

The whole agenda spread across the society covered under &amp; in the name of acceptance. The question is acceptance of what? <br><br>We can see the adaptation of law, profesional advice from science, medical knowledge of human biological concept to be presented to fit the narrative to reach what ...? To reach the stage when the pedophiles are able to take children away from the (minded) parents while parents will try to protect them and raised them with common sense.
I thought ‚ÄúQ‚Äù meant ‚Äúqueer‚Äù. As in the movie, Queer As Folk, with Patrick, Denzel, and John.
Stop poisoning your kid&#39;s brains  stop torturing them do not let any one to change their genders ,, it is a CRIME  to let any school teacher to pollute your kid&#39;s  minds as you are pushing diseases like AIDS ,Hepatitis and dirty Gonorrhoea  to their innocent bodies ...OH GOD clean planet earth from those devilish  creatures   who are spreading dirty rules to our kids ..
I am not American, I am from Asia, not that it‚Äôs relevant . I admire everyone resisting the temptation of WOKEISM. Gender ideology is one of those things WOKE ideology wants to impose onto the world. The good thing though is that many countries out there do not tolerate LGBTQ+. The Muslims and traditional Christians will never accept such ideology. It‚Äôs not helping people, specially the youth, to affirm their delusional ways. On contrary, we should feel compassion and help those suffering to get real help. I understand that in the US it‚Äôs difficult to find decent grounded doctors that have not fallen into this WOKEIMS. But I am sure there are. Keep strong US and keep fighting for the TRUTH of GOD and not for the made up truth of a few men and women.  Stay the course !
Too many ads ! I pay for the premium version but the imbedded ones are annoying
It&#39;s fraud extortion exploitation of innocence an experiment based on a LIE WAKE THE WOKE UP üõë mutilating castrating innocent children üõë
I would argue gender dysphoria stems from attachment trauma. It&#39;s traumatising for parents to hear their kid wants to transition. But it could well be that they - unwillingly in most cases - contributed to their kid experiencing attachment trauma. Since much of the attachment wiring happens subconsciously, this is a really tricky issue to tackle.
Isn&#39;t the US still a democracy?<br><br>What&#39;s going on?<br><br>Parents band together. Form coalitions. Protest. Sue all of the bodies involved in the madness including all the individuals involved in the entire process.<br><br>Mske it a class action suit like the one brought against the tobacco industry about the hiding of the addictive narure of nicotine.<br><br>Impeach elected officials who supprt the madness. Take control of your government. Get together in streets, burroughs all the way to the national level.<br><br>Bring both cuvil and criminal suits against every single person involved in the process.<br><br>Overhaul your educational system from kindergarten to university with all the dangerous frustrated gender fluidity extremists.<br><br>Boycott all bysinesses including actors and singers that support the madness.<br><br>And, it is madness.
I&#39;m so tired of trying to make sense to these gender fluidity people.<br><br>I really am. Can we just go to war and see who wins and remains alive? Yes, seriously, I mean it. It&#39;s insane and, I&#39;m just tired of the obvious lies.<br><br>Just thinking of it makes me feel I&#39;ll lose my mind. When I get like that, I feel intense and need to be violent.<br><br>Let&#39;s just go to war and see those of us who are left. Please.
i am fed up with hearing about all this rubbish. if some one is not happy with the way they was born. when they are old enough and earning there own money they can seek surgery. until then shut up.<br> god made boys with a little bit of sting , he had a bit to much so he left a little thing.<br>god made girls with a little bit of lace. he didn&#39;t have enough so he left a little space.
This new transgender epidemic of today, is like the Goth and punk trends of yesteryear... <br>On steroids <br>With a loaded gun. <br><br>Back then &quot; it was just a phase&quot; <br>But today, it has legislative backing that allows it to demand to be recognized. Imagine how many goth kids would have <i>destroyed</i> their parents, if the law allowed them to

NON LIVING THINGS ONLY have a gender, masculine or feminine. La table, Le soleil. The table is feminine, but it doesnt mensurate. The sky, the wall, the river...masculine, Not males. You can look at two bears, or hyenas, or birds, or frogs, or your dogs, and know one is male &amp; the other is female (sex) yet observe no gender.<br><br>Those trans demon baphomets are neither drag queens, nor women. They are the image of the beast. Like demons u cant tell their sex, like satan they are proud &amp; deceiving. This is not gay, this is satanic.
THE WORST PART is as a parent, is this trans thing does NOT MAGICALLY MAKE THEIR KIDS HAPPY.. AND THE LONG TERM DAMAGE BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY IS LONG TERM. That doctor is right about parents.. I would KILL for my kids and give them my heart if they needed it.. and I‚Äôm glad my kids are older now because I would go off my head if anyone talked to my kids about this rubbish.. I must say.. if my 2 year old who wasn‚Äôt influenced by the contagion, said they were the opposite sex and held that belief.. I would definitely help my child whatever that looks like.. BUT KIDS ARE JUMPING ON THIS CRAP BECAUSE THE PUBLIC ARE APPLAUDING THESE KIDS, MAKING THEM HEROES, GIVING THEM ATTENTION AND MORE POWER THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE.. Of course kids are saying they are trans when the feedback is not only positive.. it‚Äôs celebrating it..
I was just thinking‚Ä¶.I was hated to be a girl and still I do bcz let‚Äôs be honest is not easy to be a women after all and is true all this is trauma for sure bcz I was raised by me grandparents and my grandmother make me whore and curse me and everything bcz she was an alcoholic women‚Ä¶and i was just a child all this shit affect me till now i think these humans like me we never be normal but all we just can do is just to accept how we are and make our life‚Äôs better as an adults but is hard so I asking myself is this devil do all these horrible things to us or we choose to live like this I mean reincarnation‚Ä¶to learn ‚Ä¶at this point is so difficult and complicated to understand this whole life but I know one think ‚Ä¶.I was struggling so much with depression and all bcz of these negative thoughts and when I start to give up on these thoughts everything is getting better i mean im at peace with myself‚Ä¶mabye that‚Äôs the point we attracted what we thinking ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èbut these thoughts always try to get me don‚Äôt get me wrong but twhen we experience these horrible things in our life‚Äôs is hard to accept ourselves is a hard battle in our minds for sure but I think through these things we learn and some of us we fail we give up and mabye we have to choice again is so complicated I wrote so much but hope you understand my point ü•πand also this earth is not a save place at all and never was that‚Äôs the pure true !üòê
Denial of reality is thrillingly transgressive--until it isn&#39;t any more. The next move has to out transgress the previous one.
Imagine being at the bottom of the ocean, stuck with a bunch of diverse people having panic attacks.
The chikdren belong to God and poor you if you desive them! Its better for you if you put a stone around your neck says the Lord.
I was born with XXY chromosomes.  I&#39;m grateful I wasn&#39;t diagnosed until my 30&#39;s. It&#39;s a development disability, not intersex, and most people with this have an IQ of 70. Unfortunately people with this condition can easily be taken advantage of by the medical establishment and they are. Im lucky I was born high functioning however because at my age i need testosterone and to do that because of the extra chromosome the provider sends me to these butchers. I do have gender disphoria it sucks, its a big part of the condition. Its managable and I have a normal life. But, to get treating, correct treat bound to reality is not easy. <br>I feel for parent. I know exactly what happens in the gender support groups because my doctors telling go. In those group, they hate god and they very political charged. <br>People people legit condition who have spent years and years tranditioning all pushed out. People, real people with gender dysphoria have been alienated to pander to a devastated fad.
We small and strange people, we only see bits of life.  We have no crystal ball of truth, of the future.  God said we would not endure more than one day at a time.  Therefore, our identity is changing, depending on the group we belong to, the role we play, the friends we associate with, the belonging we seek.  Therefore, we can change our self-image and self-understanding many times.  It does not mean that we change from soul to soul...
I don&#39;t agree with a lot of things that Peterson says, but he has a lot of interesting things to share. His lectures were very interesting, especially before all this controversy with the Lgtb-etc-community. But what this psychiatrist is talking about, I learned about 15 years ago before this bs boom grew to this size and consequences. I wish people knew more, that they were more informed about this confusion that has been created, it is crazy to hear people not knowing what is woman or feeling fear of answer, people accepting that if you say that you perceive yourself as X or Y then you are. It is crazy, and the damage is irreparable, what they teach in some universities as an irrefutable truth and the misinformation is disproportionate levels.
Why can&#39;t I comment under any of these videos ?
When you see African leaders rejecting this ideology, it is because they have foresight, sadly courtesy of your society. This is what they are afraid of. If they seem radical in their total rejection and the laws seem like overreach, its because they know that their societies and indeed (now clear), your societies cannot contain the confusion, trauma, distress, disruption that this unnatural lifestyle produces. I am a Christian, and can say that this is more a spiritual battle of sinful mankind spitting in the face of their Creator. The very foundations of creation &#39;&#39;He made them male and female&#39;&#39;. In man&#39;s rebellion, we don&#39;t realize that the further away we move from God Almighty, the LESS human we become. About three years ago, I responded to a FB advert, the ones that simply pop-up on your timeline. The advert was from a Copenhagen Pride month group asking Africans to share their experiences and views of being LGBTQ+ in Africa. I responded, and you will see why my comment was summarily deleted off the face of facebook. Just three years ago people did not have the courage to speak out. And like Miriam says, parents themselves are hiding their identities for fear of backlash. I am relieved to see you discuss this topic. Thank you. <br>..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br>Africa should not exchange their bad practices with the West&#39;s abominable practices!<br><br>This is what I can say about this matter. It will probably be controversial to the world, but will be understood by the discerning.<br>I will speak from the African experience of body mutilation.<br><br>Long time ago, (and presently) some African societies had the practice called female circumcision. It was done as a rite of passage from girlhood to womanhood. Another practice is early marriage of girls to older men. Due to modernity and pressure, these practices are now banned in many African societies. Female circumcision was given the name Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). A lot of work is put into fighting this practice. Some people (communities) have discarded it, while in others, girls and women are either forced or due to cultural conditioning, willingly want to be cut. The women retain their ability to give birth, though sometimes painful and complicated.<br><br>This is where it gets controversial.<br><br>The same people who called us backward (And we agreed to discard these practices) - have now gone full circle and brought back worse practices against BOTH men and women, boys and girls in Western societies.<br><br>How? you ask.<br>1. Top surgery - Breast mutilation- cutting off both breasts for girls and women. Chest mutilation and insertion of plastic breasts for men/boys.<br>2. Bottom surgery - Genital/ reproductive organ mutilation by chopping off men&#39;s p&#39;s, and tearing out women&#39;s womb and v&#39;s.<br>3. Full body distortion - by administering body distorting/deforming drugs.<br><br>And so, just like female circumcision was changed to Female Genital Mutilation; Why not also change LGBT... and call it as it is - Full Body Mutilation and Deformity?<br><br>Again I ask those pushing this agenda; Should we discard our bad practices and adopt your abominable ones???<br>And yes, just like in Africa, the children &#39;agree&#39;. In the West, parents have literally been kicked out of the lives of their children, and their place taken by government, teachers and doctors. An industry minting millions has been created out of a mental challenge that will change the face of entire societies in the near future ( if Christ tarries). Some parents prod their children on, into this lifestyle so as to look &#39;fashionable&#39;. So I have to ask....Does anyone know what they are doing to these societies and families?<br><br>Scripture was right when it says this: Let us take humble heed.<br>Proverbs 14:12<br>There is a way that seems right to a man,<br>But its end is the way of death",PT1H39M27S

Really, not terribly different from what the powers-that-be in your country are doing to Trump right now.
I hope Jordon doesn‚Äôt do that.  I‚Äôve been listening to him for a long time and love his shows.  He‚Äôs a gift to all of us.  My prayers are with you Dr. Peterson.
üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ you can see how much trouble Canada is in. Jordan Peterson to my mind is one of the most thoughtful great minds of our times!‚ù§
The religious inquisition was practiced by the Spanish originally now like the flu and COVID it&#39;s making another appearance we don&#39;t need the inquisition.
Megan. Why did you come back???
Dr Peterson has spoken truth and been slightly blunt to the Woke Lefties and the Entitled Sheep. Perfect recipe for backlash from the Puppet and his Minions.
What is it with some People  , life is Tough and Rough sometimes and can be unfair  , Some People need to grow some F√ó$kin Balls  , its People&#39;s opinions words from there mouths not Bullets from a Gun , Some People don&#39;t like certain things in life and everybody is entitled to their Opinions out loud . Stopping People from having strong feelings and Opinions on anyone or any subject matter is Dangerous. Ive heard lots of comedian&#39;s make Jokes about different Religions but never heard jokes about Islam  , its already started...... the seeds to near complete censorship have been sown . I&#39;ll  get Me Coat  .
Megyn Kelly, you are insulting Canadians. Do not blame us for the Trudeau governments corruption and communist ways. That‚Äôs pulling a Jesse Waters move. Don‚Äôt turn into a Jesse Waters. He cost FOX a lot of viewers and cancelled subscriptions.
I believe this is happening because he called PM Justin Trudeau a narcissist and criticizes him as he should.
I had cops call me not long ago for same thing basically, asked me tone it down on facebook..lol   too much gangster like i guess with this LGBTQ crowd..lol<br>JC kinda gangster too eh...listen this what he said...&quot; its better for you to have a mill wheel tied around your neck and sunk to the bottom of the sea, then it is for you if you harms any of these little ones &quot;  threat, warning, Gods a hard case eh ya gets Him going, haven&#39;t learned the last couple of leasons He gave awhile back i guess, time now soon again to be all smarten up again, swift kick in all our asses coming soon..watch n see
European history ,culture, ancestry ,and ways are outdated obsolete and should be abolished...now what does that sound like to you, to me its a death threat directed at Europeans and European descendants..right, what do you think??  Well thats exactly what trudeau said to us all...then slanders us on national television calling us waste space, racists and so forth and not arrested for it,nothing, ..heres what i thinks and knows of it, its a Klausketteer child molesting baby killer and you&#39;ll soon find out, look into his west grey academy career that lasted a whole semester, pedophile a diddler...his friends, Charles ingavldson, peter nygard, just too mention two, goofle the names, ones international child trafficker, locked up now
Canada and the U.S are like they are now because of project paper clip,yes ,fact...freelands grandfather was a nazi, fact, project paper clip, our ex-minister of defense paul hellyer wrote you Americans a letter about, joe is sitting on it, go get that letter of off joey biden, before he falls down again hits his head and forgets what he done with it.
That man is a national treasure nothing short of a hero and i luvs em from the bottom of my heart, God Bless him
I and many friends stand with Jordan Peterson,, I‚Äôm regularly embarrassed by our government and the prick called Justin Trudeau.<br>Go get ‚Äòem Jordan ! Can‚Äôt wait to watch you completely undress them.
All of this comes down from the govt. and Trudeau. Although we supposedly have a conservative running Ontario so that tells you where Ford stands.
I am more than horrified!  What happened to free speech ??
How pathetic
Holy crap!  This is the best thing ive heard in a while!  I really thought Canada was done for until listening to this podcast that introduced me to Lomi!  I can now ignore the demise of my beloved Canada while hiding behind the bliss of expiditing the compositing process!  Thanks Megyn!  And thanks Lomi!
I love Jordan, he has so much knowledge! Stand strong!!
It seems those in power do not like any other philosophy but their own, even if it is crazy, the Canadian pm is a nutter
Jordan Peterson fairly and openly criticizes the embarrassing Prime Minister Trudeau so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Dictator Trudeau is behind this investigation.
All of his critics combined couldn&#39;t begin to challenge JP. This JT even looks plastic.
Jordan Peterson is exactly what happens to you when you let your ego go to your head. He is a licensed CLINICAL psychologist. People keep pointing at him and saying Canada is attacking his free speech. When you hold a license, when you contract to someone, when you represent a governing body, there are rules. <br><br>As a man that is supposed to help those in need, he shouldn‚Äôt be publicly be stating that he has a disgust for those that he could be faced treating should they ask for help. <br><br>He deserves to lose his license if he does not comply. He need a wake up call. He is the perfect example of ego going to someone‚Äôs head. He needs to stick to giving advice about living life with healthy habits and stop giving his personal, bullshit, opinions. Especially when they aren‚Äôt asked for
A pure attack because feelings are hurt.  Gtfo it
Short the Canadian dollar ! Canada is finished, lost to the far left and China.
The truth sometimes is offensive. Nothing new here.üòä
So freedom of speech is no more in Canada? This is Orwellian the bureaucratic lefty faceless cabal is maneuvering total control over people. If Canadians let this happen, next the world.
In 100 years they will study us and speak about a lone genius that saved our era from absolute madness
This guy is a hero and they will try their hardest to shut him down because he is a threat to them
Jordan is a Canadian diamond ‚Ä¶ he is multiple times brighter than our PM &amp; all his cronies ‚Ä¶ we are living in a dictatorship up here and people have to be taught how to recognize it ‚Ä¶
These SOBs need to be stopped and NOW!!!!  This is the playbook of the Rothschild stage 6 of the control plan. Remove all political opposition... <br>They are using the media to cancel or demonise any opposition to their narrative. <br>I think Jordan will tell them to F off. üòÇüòÇüòÇ Hopefully not politely
Canada, China, Australia. some parts of EU and partly US were a Petri dishes for shadow government globalists long before it started to seem obvious. &quot;You Will Know Them by Their Fruits&quot;, even if the flags and agendas seem kinda different.
Very scary the spread of Socialism, shades of George Orwells &quot;1985&quot; we want a Democracy not an oppressive regime.
It‚Äôs clear the far left cannot withstand opposition without oppression.
Whats happened to Canada?! So sad. Where are the Canadians stading up againat this nonsense. Get rid of Trudeau. Have a real person lead the country, not a woke liberal weak man. Canada deserves and needs better. Do it soon or it will be too late.
Is Canada no longer a democracy?
Poor JP üò¢ Canada doesn‚Äôt realize what a national treasure they have ü´∂üèº
Thank you Megyn, you are courageous.
I used to want to immigrate to Canada, it seemed to be so beautiful and a very kind country. Boy am I glad that I didn‚Äôt. What an awful country it‚Äôs becoming. It‚Äôs becoming like China.
Voran Peterson is the reason why my daughter, still has a mother.
Of course he‚Äôs being investigated! They investigate anybody who is an excellent human being. They love bringing these people down. They love to intimidate. They love to shut up any one who dares to not be brainwashed. What have we come to?!
Canada psychology  orgn is a stupid orgn
The Liberal Lefties can get away with much, but their opponents are often attacked for merely speaking their minds. Thus, today&#39;s largely Far Left loonies I call Intellectual Fascists.
Jordan Petersen&#39;s fingernail clippings are more intelligent that all of Canadian government...and that woke University scene..... It&#39;s like Socrates talking to garden slugs....
We are living the Hunger Games
Britain became a police state  in 2020. Few of Our ‚ÄúConservatives‚Äù believe in Conservatism, they are liberal woketards &amp; elitist.
I love Jordan.

Mr. Jordan Peterson for Prime Minister.",PT10M32S
A Conversation with Piers Morgan | EP 295,"Dr Jordan B Peterson and Piers Morgan discuss the art of interviewing, the importance of living truthfully, the pitfalls of sycophancy, and they go into depth regarding the 2016 election, and the aftermath of Donald Trump.
 
Piers Morgan is a British journalist and television personality who started his career working as a freelance writer for the Sun. Later he would be chosen by Rupert Murdock as editor for his publication, News of the World. This appointment would make Morgan the youngest British news editor (29) in more than fifty years. He would go on to be the editor of publications such as the Daily Mirror and MailOnline before ramping into a career on television. He would introduce documentaries for the BBC, and had a channel 4 political interview show with Amanda Platell, all before his stint as a judge on America‚Äôs Got Talent. Morgan would compete on and win the 2008 season of Celebrity Apprentice, and later famously interview the show's host, Donald Trump, after he had become the 45th US President. Morgan would work on numerous talk shows and documentary series before starting his current day production, Piers Morgan Uncensored. This show, on which controversial and celebrity guests debate Morgan, would be the first launched on talkTV, and welcome back President Trump for its premiere and second episodes.

It isn&#39;t right for the Titanic to be a for profit tourist destination. It is the grave of hundreds of poor souls. I don&#39;t think Stockton was a hero. He clearly thumbed his nose at risks and warnings.  And why are we so concerned about these five rich people and no one bats an eye at the African refugees who drowned off the coast of Greece last week.  And how many billions of dollars were spent to find these five billionaire people? Something has gone really screwy with our sense of proportion.
How can you justify all the ad hominem fallacy vomiting forth from Trump&#39;s mouth since the moment he announced his candidacy in 2016, long before anyone had time to attack him? There are grotesque exaggerations re; Trump in this interview...except for your observation that he has become the &quot;biggest, sorest loser...&quot; with no &quot;empathy valve.&quot;
I have to disagree with some of the things that you are saying! We‚Äôve had many people who have been inside their voting precincts and taking pictures themselves and also their testimonies of their ballots are being destroyed and finding themselves in their garbage dumpsters and I know personally people who have checked their voting records themselves and their vote was actually not recognized by their Ballots counting themselves! I have had some problems with Trump sometimes but I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else is willing to be speaking out against their corruption situation happening in our Nation !
US SC did not shoot down women‚Äôs abortion they sent it back to the states where they belong in This country
Piers talks a lot
At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFcTbf8yI8&amp;t=31m00s"">31:00</a>, what Piers is describing about Blair is what is described in Revelations 18, &quot;For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.&quot;
I mean I haven‚Äôt been into politics for long but one could relate it as the Adam‚Äôs were a British American institution trump would be german
Even my dad who condones trumps wealth secretly brags that trumps richness is German, cause my dads from there
Relatable. Hilary is relatable. Now I know people are going to blame her for slandering trump. They are both the same type of person. Well liked by their genders.
Yea if its one thing i think about joe biden its that hes empathetic.<br>These leftists live in a complete fantasy land.
Joe Biden has empathy? His 40 years in government show otherwise, Piers. üòíü§°
Hahah piers says Joe Biden has empathy hahah na he rapes kids
How can you put a corrupt election behind you, when it could happen again.
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the only reason. You should have a look at some of the election regulator hearings (including independent witnesses) and also‚Ä¶. the vote dumps were extremely odd. I think there is quite a bit of evidence. I don‚Äôt know why it hasn‚Äôt been taken seriously. I guess the justice system is corrupt too - which we are also witnessing it political persecution.
Trump &quot;hopes Biden is alright&quot; when Biden fell, he said Maybe he watched this about the empathy part
People are afraid to critic toughly because of the claim of bullying.
Clinton‚Äôs patronizing attitude? It‚Äôs just out of touch. She relies on her middle class roots to be relatable, yet she‚Äôs in a different stratosphere<br>Edit: she manages to remain humble tho
Trump was attack but more importantly criminally lied about. It would have driven most people insane, literally. The forward conservative vision was Make America Great Again and we see what was done with that. When a man is willing to sacrifice himself as Trump is doing for all of us, he is demonstrating the deepest compassion.
Of course hitler was a a person who was relatable. He went to jail and saw the suffering of his people. One person a line is not responsible for all the war crimes but he thankfully took the slack. What about America throwing over the Russian shadow government? He was overthrowing his government. I can‚Äôt imagine how many Russians were murdered in Afghanistan. Is it ever mentioned? Of course not. I don‚Äôt have Russian sympathies but I‚Äôm white and I feel like the overthrowing of the Russians directly influenced the murder of so called Christian‚Äôs in Africa, because it made it okay to kill white people
I care about 2020. If we don&#39;t address voter fraud, we will get Biden again.
If you watched Trump&#39;s many white house meetings with different citizen groups, he was the person Piers&#39; describes. Regarding the 2020 election, when the democrats insist at the start of covid that it is non-negotiable that we had to have mail in ballots, they did so since they planned to use it to their advantage.. This could not be done correctly that fast. Signature verifications were turned off in many places, anyone could have voted and more than once. It is clear that cheating could occur given this and many were coming forward bragging that they did everything possible to make Trump loss - Everything? I believe them. Please how are we still needing to argue what is obvious? When the margins are thin, any margin lost illegitimately would throw the election.
American gun laws keep us imprisoned. Can‚Äôt have good public transportation, people trying to pay for the safest schools. Keeps people out too. I think it‚Äôs the basis for America but ideally our people ought to feel safe
Jordan Peterson is one of the most important men of my lifetime of 51 year so far! He is absolutely a wonderful human being and such a gift to the world‚ù§ Stat strong JP and know that you are loved and appreciated so much. God bless ‚ù§
I know which 11 year old bully Trump is: Cartman!!!
Oh Mr Peterson you are wise and clever and my new source of wisdom ü§©
I love your honesty here Pierce.
piers morgan was an sellout .. most of his career and the only thing he wouldnt push and where his red flag was .. was this lgbtq agenda!<br>he NEVER adressed it .. he NEVER adressed all the negtative things he had done working for CNN .. so to me he still is the bad guy! the corporate shill and entrist!
Wow, this is the best I have ever seen from Piers Morgan. I&#39;ve never quite known what I thought about him or where I stood with him. I always felt he was at least honest about where he stood, which I appreciated, but there are a lot of places where I thought he got things wrong. But interestingly in this interview he basically admits he thinks he got it wrong as well, and he explains WHY it was probably wrong with far more understanding than I could ever given. I also really admire his willingness to talk to his son and make that decision to really listen to Jordan Peterson. We all get things wrong, but it takes a very special kind of person to actually think with this much insight about what they have done right and what they have done wrong. I have to say, Piers Morgan has just really earned my respect in a way I never felt before this interview.
Fools like JP and Piers assume election was the most secure and fairest and Sleepy Joe is most popular president in history.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFcTbf8yI8&amp;t=11m43s"">11:43</a> in and they are still just talking about themselve. Dont waste your time. I even put it on fast mode.
It&#39;s weird female hypergamy always being condoned though. Like not just &quot;incels&quot; but many women complain about loneliness and being without a man. Can&#39;t really demand I want to be super selective but then complain later why you&#39;re lonely. People just need to date their leagues imo.  :/
America is in desperate place and still think that Trump is the only one that can stand and destroy the corrupt mob! We , as a coyntry, are up against a totally different game now than what it used to be and we need a strong, vicious lion that can take them down while sacrificing other goods that we used to enjoy. It is a diferent world now and we need to save America at all costs. Trump IS the candidate for the job. Period.
Piers has done very well for someone with low level Down syndrome
What Draw ?.... Great fight<br>And<br>Both Warriors... Thank you.. üòä
Absolutely NOBODY cares what you do .... Until you come for our Children!!!!!..<br>I am 53 and @ the ages for this book i was eating dirt and chasing Snakes,  Riding my bike and playing games .. NOBODY mentioned Anything about Sex.... Because i was a Kid and being mixed ... My Aunt Almeida would lay a Whopping on ya for even Mentioning Sex ....  <br><br>Bravo.‚ù§...
Indonesian shadow production. There are forces in the universe working behind the scenes of all our interactions.
It‚Äôs easy being nice. I don‚Äôt wake up and think I need to be nice. I‚Äôm naturally nice!
I think of these guys as two of the wise men at the manger.  Im not a practicing Christian but listening to Peterson makes me grateful for the bible nonetheless.
Piers is becoming more likeable. Rather than arguing non stop which British presenters love to do. I look for information and not fighting others.
What a tool. Joe Biden has empathy, if you really think that you‚Äôre a Buffoon
You may see now, in JUNE 2023, that President Trump should still be President Trump.<br>He was right all along.
TRUMP SERVES IT UP STRAIGHT...SOMEOBE TELL ME ABOUT JOE&#39;s   EMPATHY..TYPICAL ACADEMIC
Wait, this guy is a real person? Lol, arrite Morgan. My mind is changed, but I got my eye on you.
Trump 2024
I actually DO do a better job with praise than with criticism. However, at times I do need criticism. I just do better when it&#39;s given in a friendly manner as opposed to accusatory. If I feel threatened or like I&#39;m being accused, I just go on the defense. When criticism is given gently, making my feel you&#39;re on my side, I can self reflect and see what I&#39;m doing, sand try to fix it.
That ventriloquist story is incredible.
Peirs should have me on..<br>I&#39;d give him a shocking experience
Pierce is jealous of Trump. ‚ÄúBiden has a respect for democracy‚Äù‚Ä¶whhhaaattt??? Also the election was 100% stolen no matter what these two or anyone else says. Trump was far in the lead and all of a sudden random truck loads of Biden ballots came in. Shady and false ballots. Nothing is wrong with Trump, I just wish he‚Äôd stop responding to stupidity and feeding the gals narratives about him. That makes him fall into media traps constantly. If his camp could get him to stop doing that, it would be better for Trump overall
I just love this man&#39;s mind. He gives us a unique insight .",PT1H47M20S

Yang sebenarnya harus sibuk untuk memikirkan cara bagaimana untuk improved publik speaking malah overthinking tidak jelas.<br>Jujur, saya adalah salah satu orang yang selalu membandingkan diri dengan orang lain. <br><br>Tapi Nemu video ini membuat saya tersadar.<br>Pentingnya mencintai diri sendiri dan tidak membandingkan diri dengan orang lain.<br><br>Terima kasih tak terhingga ^_^
Pelajaran video ini: <br>- Percaya diri<br>- Menyayangi diri sendiri<br>- Memiliki teman yg mendorong ke hal lebih baik<br><br>Makasih min, jujur saya orang nya selalu mendahulukan org lain.

Bisnis jasa kontruksi yang sulit saling sikut tapi malah justru memberimu ilmu banyak, arti kesabaran, relasi, kepercayaan, dan berpikir &quot;bagaimana caranya&quot;. Memulai ini memang sangat berat. Tapi aku percaya sama orang yg selalu bilang &quot;nikmati prosesnya dan lalui&quot;

Karena itu juga akan mempengaruhi masa depanmu.<br>Aturan 4 : bandingkan dirimu dengan kamu yang kemarin, bukan dengan seseorang di hari ini.

They&#39;re scientifically describing how important empathy is. Love thy neighbor. Walk a mile in someone elses shoes.
Extremes on anything is dangerous. I don‚Äôt have have issues with conservatives nor liberals. It‚Äôs the extremist on both sides that are causing issues. They usually are not we‚Äôll rounded with issues and have no sense of self. I wish we could go back to the days where people could see both sides.
I like you guys, and I listen to you all talk all the time, but there is something you are all missing including Jordan. There is really no such thing as far right or alt- right, which shows on my scale in the far left corner. It is the far right of the left side of the spectrum and not really right at all. So unless you‚Äôre speaking of the European version of the right wing that are in fact fascists, or Nazi‚Äôs. The American right does not want more government, but minimal government. So on a scale of 0-100% government control we can all agree that Zero government is anarchy correct? So the first step towards the left and more government control is in fact a Constitutional Republic form of government. If we shift further right from less government to zero government we would cease to be Conservatives, and become Anarchists. I have a map of the true political spectrum I based off of older models, and clearly it defines these discrepancies. You‚Äôre so called alt right are really those at the 100% government domination level, and thus separate all together. So hence laid out properly the far left of the map is the left and total government control and rightly so. So you calling a right wing American a far right or alt - right is essentially calling them an Anarchist. I know not one conservative who wants law and order yet anarchy. It‚Äôs an antithetical statement in itself. If you step another step towards the left you become in essence a Democracy , and beyond that government is gaining too much power and begins to become socialistic with the final stages ending at complete Government domination and Communism. AKA Dictatorship, Oligarchy, Monarchy. And that‚Äôs all I have to say about that.
so does that stand to reason that if an individual&#39;s  parents have a wide gap in their age, that this could have an effect on how sexist they are because their genes had spent more time in one gender? If that&#39;s the case, it makes sense that there might be more male sexists since on average, men are older than women when they conceive....
The comical part is the Torah was not just inspired writing of the prophet Moses but dictated to Moses by God. So in a sense Mr. P is Psycho-Analyzing God. Good luck with that buddy :D. Just read it. The story will indicate allegory when it is intended to be taken that way. To my knowledge no single part of Genesis is &quot;indicated&quot; as allegory.<br>Keep reading sir. Its a supernatural text. You are on the right track and if you continue in your studies you will inevitably come to an understanding with it. Just stop trying to understand the mind of the all-mighty. You will never fathom the understanding of my God who is outside of time and space.
5 yrs ago and still getting multiple comments a day. Good stuff.
JP is the sexiest man to have walked this planet... swear!
Jordan Peterson is right society is fucked really.
Joe is making a great point and wrangled it up
The bible and its cousins are way to dangerous. Simply because they were written or edited to enhance social controls. I mean supposedly god gives you free will but sends you to hell to burn for all eternity for not choosing to be his slave. Something isnt right there and something in my gut tells me that theres a trap that will destroy the human in me in side those books.
Even these intelligent, well informed people bought the lie that Trump did not condemn the White Nationalists and Neo Nazis on the spot. They bought the edited tape that the mass media circulated. <br><br>You can argue that he spent too much time talking about the statues, but he condemn the racists immediately. That part was edited out.
Your genes are racist wtf u no if u listen to these big word people u realize there full of shit. But the other guy made some good points.
You need Alejandro solomondrin.üíô
More often then not people be lurkin on the Jewish
Don‚Äôt say we like that apples to you. You have more rights than most ppl then
didn&#39;t religion create patriarchy?  purposely and in horrible ways?  especially the Christian/Islam/Judaism ones?  women are blamed for the fall from grace, repeatedly called harlots, laws were made to make us for sale to the highest bidder by our fathers AND we were supposedly ordered by God to be subservient. oh, and burned as witches way more often than men. look what happened to Joan of arc (ark?) she led an ARMY SUCCESSFULLY,! she may have been schizophrenic or really hearing entities guiding her decisions or just following her own instincts/making strategic moves according to her own knowledge and intelligence.  but BECAUSE she was good at what she did, they killed her as a witch.  women are smart and men just didn&#39;t like it, so they used their physical dominance to suppress that, very completely.  so women got SMARTER.  jokes on them. ü§£ü§£ü§£ I&#39;m half joking half serious with that last part.
He&#39;s correct
The duality of man
Thanks for the info. And perspective :)
You guys are so forgiving when talking about nazis and how maybe that could have been you if you were living that era and society. Why don&#39;t you share that some soft spot for terrorists in Afghanistan? I&#39;m glad you can pull yourself back and humanize everyone, but the right can never do that with foreigners, immigrants, and people that are &quot;different&quot;

It didnt age well for JP to say nazis and the right drew a line of seperation üòÖ
The co-host is decrying any reference to Nazis as ‚Äúsubhuman‚Äù, ‚Äúanimals‚Äù, and/or ‚Äúvermin‚Äù, instead of cautioning not to refer to (((Germans))) as being those inhuman things.<br>     Is he just stupid or was that actually a (((FREUDIAN SLIP)))?

"""Masturbation Has DANGEROUS Effects on Dopamine!"" | Jordan Peterson and Andrew Huberman Discuss","The digital era has brought many men easy access to anything they desire.

I think the feminist movement and then the me too movement has lead to a chilling effect among men, where the effort involved and the potential minefield they must pass through in order to find intimacy with a woman is just so great that they choose the path of least resistance.<br><br>I think this is a form of learned helplessness.
I&#39;ve heard that reading the bible and believing in Jesus can increase dopamine.  Then afterwards it goes down and has a deleterious effect.  And that&#39;s why I stopped reading thevbible.
Sounds like a guy who never had sex or a girlfreind!! Its important to purge your body     Its like bad mayo in the jar, waiting to give you prostate cancer    that will never happen to me!!  being doing it since I was a teen   I am not worried it will stop when Im dead   then I can continue in the next life!!!!!
Guys porn is demon portal so , i know its hard to not watch but please come to Jesus for salvation.
Masturbation??? From what I can see this is more related to pornography.
hahahahahahahahahahaha nice try lol
I need a group
so women are encouraged to &quot;explore their body&quot; but dudes are junkies if they do? Also some men just don&#39;t get women for different reasons or are stuck in a relationship with asexual partners. So what then, change everything in your life, move to a different city, change your persona, pretend you are a funny millionaire both well manored and aggressive so women just so you get more real sex? Or stop your urges until your balls burst from within? &gt; Spoiler your balls hurt after a week without masturbation. Or should those men encourage prostitution and throw their money out the window? The nature gives you the option to get rid of all of these problems with ease and completely free (both  stress- and moneywise) &gt; wanking, but no: it&#39;s bad for you, your hand will fall off. Thanks Dad.
I was always masterbating before the huge availability of porn and it bever affected anything..in fact it improved my sexual imagination.When porn became so widespread and available I still masterbaited about those same old things and it didn&#39;t affect anything negatively.I will say it is sometimes like trying to find something you like on Netflix and just giving up because you can&#39;t find anything good.<br>In total porn has not adversely affected my life in any Way.
Men, of all ages, gotta gotta gotta cum...........<br>If you women out there expect us to have 6 or 7 figure incomes, be young, attractive, &amp; super fit, that&#39;s fine.  Keep upping your requirements for accepting a man into your life.  Men, you must be Alpha, rich &amp; generous with your moola, &amp; bow to the needs of the women you want!<br>Remember people, main stream society &amp; the media are your real GOVERNMENT, i.e., CONTROLLERS of your MIND.  Whatever the TV News people say, believe without question!!<br>Get your boosters &amp; wear that face diaper 24/7,  -----  FOREVER, &amp; EVER &amp; EVER!!!!!!!<br>...... &amp; make sure never to beat off!!!!  it might not be good for your health ü§¢
so porn makes you a cuckold.
People don&#39;t realize the extreme danger of pornography.  It&#39;s from the Devil.  Point blank period
Pornography destroys people.  Big-time
Praying helps heal
Porn and masterbation is a very very serious sin.  It destroys alot of men.  So sad.   Pray for those who view porn and masterbait.  It destroys a person soul.  It&#39;s ungodly as hell
semen retention is what those proud guys do to make them more masculine and  aggressive.Its a bottled up  chemical that can make men aggressive and  use the sexual energy into artistic or  work pursuits,or  fighting.
Use me as a dislike button for these, um fellas...
You fellas are full of it...
Very true so just hold it and talk to it. If it talks back then you are good, else you have work to do!
Not to be rude but I find this hilarious didn‚Äôt even know it was a real thing why not just get a real woman to fulfill your urges why watch a video of something you can do yourself
I thought this was on masterbation itself not a porn addiction video
I watch porn
I am female. One note about the comment about &quot;caring to have children.&quot; I don&#39;t have the desire to have children. I care about ALL people not just children.¬†<br><br>Back to the topic. I used to have a daily orgasm with masturbation - took 2 minutes out of my day. Masturbation is/was mechanical for me. I would think about other things while waiting such as insulation for my attic (I was looking up at my ceiling) or what I was going to clean in the house.¬†<br><br>Pornography is stupid/unrealistic and therefore not arousing (nothing arouses me much except no money problems/financial security,  a clean house that is easy to function in, cause then I can relax and enjoy physical pleasure or be more open to it).¬†<br><br>I am not interested in sex at all with my spouse because penetration does not result in orgasm in females. Plus, I don&#39;t see how touching, body contact or sex is associated with &quot;love&quot; because really all it seems both spouses want anyway is an orgasm.¬†<br><br>But I love my spouse and want him to be happy so...<br><br>Patience, selflessness... things like that are more associated with love.
Stimulation in movies?music videos?
And what&#39;s the explanation for male zillenials that don&#39;t watch it, and still can&#39;t parabond?social is worse
So no dysfunction no problem? X)<br>I can&#39;t believe ppl let it affect their ability to communicate like wassup dudes xD
No!
It is called habituation, meaning you get less response as you are exposed to the stimuli.<br>There is, however, also a phenomenon called sensitization. It is when you get more response to a certain stimuli. <br><br>This is why we have foreplay, it also can be linked to negative things like people developing a phobia or PTSD, making them more sensitive to certain stimuli.
men really dont want pair bonding. its just wham bam thankyou mam
Now I want to know about masturbation without porn or visual stimulation. Is it as negative?
I‚Äôm probably going to eat shit for this but when women quit giving it up, and they nearly always do, wtf are we supposed to do? Porn keeps this dog under the porch. Without porn I‚Äôd have a girlfriend and half my shit. üòä
Everytime the old man speaks , I think of Kermit the Frog
Masturbation is natural and fun. Any uptight men who don&#39;t use it are penalized by a much higher risk of dying from prostate cancer.
Please share the Love of the Son of God. Please write His Words in your Heart, and share them. Please Forgive, and Pray for everyone... Immanuel, God with us...
I said to myself, I&#39;ll drop the porn the moment I start dating a girl i liked a lot, and that helped me... Why would i put my partner  i love, through situation of being in a relationship with an addict? And why would I watch porn, when i can have the real thing? That kind of mentality helped me stop watching porn 11 months ago, after watching it for 20 years... Sometimes multiple times a day... Start working towards finding your mate (the one that you actually like, and will care about not to do it for), it can help you overcome the addiction... For me, in the past, no matter how many times i quit porn, i get back to it within first 10 days... This time, with a gf i love, I managed to get rid of it for good...
Don&#39;t most men pretend they are the guy in the porno? Doesn&#39;t that fly in the face  the part about voyeurism and only watching other people do it?<br><br> I even prefer the man in the porno to be the same race as me, if I have to see him at all that is.<br> Our fantasies create a placebo effect and for the moment we get laid (it&#39;s a mind#$@%).
Watching two lesbians involved in romance &#39;porn&#39; can show you how women liked to be touched, caressed, etc.<br>The hard core crap doesn&#39;t do anything for me.

Advice you might not want to hear but need to.  Not all the porn you see is produced with consent.<br>Not all of the actors in that porn are consenting to the distribution, either.<br>Okay so you could be the cleanest guy around, you&#39;re looking for vanilla stuff, nothing shady.  Nice quiet afternoon at home.  Relax. Okay there&#39;s no shame there&#39;s no shame. Have fun.<br>That image of an adult woman could be there without her consent.<br>Okay<br>It&#39;s not your fault<br>It&#39;s not her fault<br>She had a dodgy ex boyfriend or a sicko put a roofie or something okay<br>Or they Photoshop her head<br>Okay<br>Just be aware the internet is a mind control trap if you&#39;re not careful<br>A nice playboy magazine is a vetted industry it&#39;s not always good stories for your mind however they are usually by consent<br>Keep an eye out on the industry taking advantage of people who wanted to be clothes models though
I was clean for so long. Now I can&#39;t go a few hours without. I don&#39;t know what to do.
Damn that&#39;s depressing. Do you think finding a sexual partner is easy nowadays.The only option I see are fat women or ugly feminist, the nice ones are married or just ghosting around. Sorry, no I go back to onanism. At least, I don&#39;t have to argue about silly things or feel like a pervert because I tried to engage a girl.
You do drugs to feel good, you continue doing drugs to not feel bad. Replace drugs with porn. Same same
What we sacrifice by masterbaring: STD&#39;s, Child Support, Child Alienation, Divorce Rape, Nagging and etc... Don&#39;t let these White Knight&#39;s shame or guilt you back to the Gynosentric Plantation, men.... LONG LIVE MGTOW MONK...

Listen to this man... Best podcast ever
Meth head pretending to have it all together making large sums of money off people.  Scum bag.
why is that when i go to channel page and sort it with popular<br>than jordan peterson is not on list even though one of his podcast is 37mil and should be in top 3
My parents unfortunately haha  Action News at 6 on channel 6 üá∫üá∏
Identity politics are a joke! It also serves as an extension of divisiveness in our society....wake up people.
This was so good to hear. üòä
Jordan Paterson, should learn to shut up. Podcasters are so arrogant &amp; full of their own self importance. Impart ur knowledge with ur children only,
Jordan Peterson in my whole existence, one of the most philosophical, logical, rich knowledged and aware more than any full american city, i dont adore people nowdays, but man god damned i see him close to Plato and much more, he is a benefit to any generation from the past till the future ones, hands down from Romania!
75%? haha...
This was an interesting discussion. Lost sleep cuz I started watching before bed and just was intrigued by this. Watched the whole thing.
He should talk in correctional facilities.

Great shot of your studio
Dullified by pharmaceuticals.  Anti depressant are everywhere. Just to name 1 pill.

The dialogue between Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson always offers so much to think about! On my channel, we also delve into these intellectual conversations. Feel free to drop by and share your thoughts!
I also love how if Joe doesn&#39;t understand something or thinks something is maybe not so positive, he stops Mr. Peterson, explains how he perceives it, and lets him explain the deeper meaning behind it... I think Joe is a bit of an intellectual in his own right üëçüèæ
I absolutely love how Peterson references the Bible... Outstanding!
Great convo! Rogan and Peterson are class acts! Would listen to Peterson everyday if he was on! Well done sir!
From <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xc7DN-noAc&amp;t=1h17m00s"">1:17:00</a> and that next 7 minutes really spoke to me - hating essays in school BECAUSE the subjects assigned were of zero interest. Decades passed, I became a journalist/essayist, refining and clarifying my thoughts &quot;on paper&quot;, exploring subjects that I was passionate about, even if it was for an audience of one. I am so grateful to have had one or two moments in my life where someone has thanked me for being the catalyst for their own self-improvement. They did the hard work but they were thanking me... so humbling.
What a great episode.<br>I watched the whole thing many times since it came out.<br>Joe should invite him again.

I am Russian and I do confirm everything the professor said about leftist policies in USSR and Russia. It was the most enormous tragedy in the whole Russian history of 1 thousand years long. The wars against Chingiz Khan Empire&#39;s and Hitler&#39;s armies were not even close.

Listening to JP is becoming so much more interesting, intriguing and  wholesome than church services on Sunday...If you listen well enough, its so much better!!....Such a blessing this man is to mankind....Pastors and reverends...take notes!!!.....
Is it saying to believe that O‚ÄôDoul is supposed to get with one female when he‚Äôs 20 years old and stay with that one female until he die at 8090 years old it‚Äôs insanity I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs always always those who got a problem with one dude having two or three girlfriends and those the only people you deal with this dude clearly just sat right here and said is people who Mary go on that Saturday Mary Mary fucking people behind me, husband or wife back and he said that‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs no problem with that but it‚Äôs a problem if they do have two or three girlfriends or two or three wives death issue and it‚Äôs gonna hurt the kids. How would it hurt the kids if my wife got a girlfriend to help her with the kids well, one of my girlfriends to help her with the kids, would it be helping the kids this do so crazy
Why do these people always wear headphones? Because it&#39;s cool?
Foreman. Not Frazier. Jamie wtf.
Jordan makes good points, but at best he‚Äôs extraordinarily bad at describing his context, and at worst, he makes shit up. There is no ‚Äú5 second rule‚Äù about eye contact with women in the workplace. That‚Äôs absurd.

The Sleep issue I can understand. Been there.  <br>Based on Jordan&#39;s experience I will need to read Upton Sinclair&#39;s book &quot;The Fasting Cure&quot;.  Sinclair wrote the well known novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; but this &quot;Fasting Cure&quot; book looks to be much more important.

Thank you for reminding me of my imperfection. Thank you for reminding me of my own role in my despair. I don&#39;t know how I let myself get this bad again, with my choices it was inevitable. I f&#39;d around and found out again. I am cleaning up my room, making my bed, focusing on my diet, sleep and work more conscientiously. I pray it will be enough if I keep thinking critically and make the best of everything. Make the most of the present opportunities. Never allowing myself to feel above doing what needs doing. Thank you again Jordan, and thank you again Joe for another great podcast/interview. Really useful stuff.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xc7DN-noAc&amp;t=2h57m33s"">2:57:33</a>  so is it really attributable to carnivore dieting, or is cutting out all the other thing‚Äôs unintentionally was cutting out all the chemicals and pesticides put on them not necessarily the fruits and veggies themselves. This as Jordan mentions is a relatively newer problem on the historical scale
2 HR 49min into the video, could this perhaps be caused by the chemicals induced into foods? Theorizing off of when you said the breads and such kinds of food, alot of it is Enriched in Chlorine, bleach, and benzoyl. Harsh harsh chemicals many more than those three,  used in almost everything, including vegetables. Via the pesticides used, that soak into the fruits and veggies themselves, on top of that the chemicals used to alter it for longer freshness.
I love how this podcast begins with Joe saying ‚Äúhello, Jordan‚Äù and 15 seconds later Jordan is already explaining something
his channel is growing without uploading new pods casts to here . sucked in youtube
Joe and Jordan thank u my brothers for being real I love the shit out of power soul talk realness I am blessed to say I watch this one to night.   U 2 of man guys and brothers would of made better leaders then most of the guys that got in      thank u both for a perfect and percussion real cut experience........ My borthers          <br><br><br><br>Smoke weed everyday ......
Jordan Peterson diets consisted of eating chicarron lol
If I&#39;m not watching the video, I really am not able to figure out who is speaking.
Jordan Peterson is so mellow and talkative in some of his old talks. Now we know he used to be on Benzo&#39;s many of those times. <br>One sad thing about people and drugs is how it often seems, even to others, that the person was better in many ways on Drugs than off them. Wish we can naturally tune our own brains soonish in future instead of relying on the dirty chemicals we have now which have such ginormous side effects to them!
This is the most bullshit I&#39;ve ever heard
This is the reason I believe most Women are not intelligent and rather, instead, very emotional. <br><br>The simple fact they can&#39;t see that most Women are not in high hour / high stress jobs, simply because they do not &quot;want&quot; to be and do not &quot;need&quot; to be.<br><br>Most commonly this happens in Law, Investment Banking, and Tech ... yet each of those industries takes the heat for being sexist ... which raps around to the other &quot;issue&quot; with Women admitting they&#39;re at fault and/or the root cause. <br><br>***We would not see such a huge influx to OnlyFans, if the above were not the case. Most Women want it &quot;easy&quot; no matter the cost. Otherwise we would see a similar surge in these other positons that offer equal or better pay than OnlyFans ... without the &quot;shame&quot; ... <br><br>Yet what is the REAL outcome? If only Women could admit to themselves the truth (and that they are not 1 to 1 with Men / very far from it)... they would live much better lives and not lead future Women to unhappiness by telling lies about what would make them happy (simply because that Women now has to convince herself she made the right choice 20 years ago)

Jordan Peterson .    ,  <br>...
No. In the name of Jesus Christ that would be wrong. Ask the aliens about Jesus christ. What do they know?
Life is difficult. No argument. But compared to what? Not living. Not a good comparison in my humble opinion.
What type of personality wants you to believe you are born to suffer? Obviously he&#39;s listening to western society.... <br><br>No, people aren&#39;t born to suffer, they&#39;re born to thrive. A narcissist, sociopath, or psychopath tells you to accept suffering, so they aren&#39;t called out when they&#39;re the cause of your suffering. It&#39;s about protecting yourself from suffering, which is where rights come in. It isn&#39;t about seeking human rights, but is about understanding them so you can thrive and know what to protect at all times... for the sake of thriving...<br><br>Peterson almost brought himself up to the right path at the end, but not quite... The labeled personality patterns labeled above want to disarm you so that you cannot protect yourself from them. When you protect yourself from them, then you thrive... and they cannot stand it. They are the cause of suffering, period. Don&#39;t call them out, and they succeed in generating more suffering, without consequence.
Difference between the meaning of life and a symphony is that someone created a symphony, and life is about you following your innate path, not allowing another to make your path align with theirs as they see fit...harmony comes with respecting another&#39;s wishes and how your life can enhance theirs, not as someone else created for you to follow...
You need to teach the world to be a philanthropist
Be a monster precisely.  Anyone who makes the astonishing amount of money that he does without the corresponding philanthropy is a hypocrite.  So yes, he truly has become a wilful ignorant to the plight of men and women, fellow citizens blah ü§Æ
You don&#39;t need to carry a cross on your back to have a meaningful life...
‚ÄúCompare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.‚Äù ~ Jordan B. Peterson
Peterson is a pill popping degenerate. He was tossed by his university in Toronto for being a babbling mess. He was high constantly. He drools on his expensive suits and cries over nothing. He should be institutionalized for his own safety.
I am educated enough to understand exactly what professor petersons content in his talks is getting at. Not everyone fits in with the criteria as there word hoard is not as expanded as the likes of peterson or especially a genius like William s Burroughs can with words, maybe taking a leaf from proffesor Brian Cox who talks in layman quantum physics to a baby and the baby understands. I&#39;m not saying change his syntax tweak it so that the prime audience of his message are just those types they do not know why they are demoralised or disillusioned or what not. We are born to suffer, so we endure and accept the fact that it is all a by product of function. We are left with little choice in essence and i personally struggled my way to age 42 and I&#39;ve been addicted to heroin 24 years, benzos for 15 now and pregablin to top it off, so I am enduring the absolute misery because action is as scary as inaction. My point is he would do better in reaching deciples accrued to him by speaking their language in written word too. Much love to all those suffering especially when you are juggling multiple drug dependent&#39;s. Time for another crack pipe goodbye horses
&quot;be a monster&quot;  is advice from a psychopath.
Yes, becoming that civilized MONSTER
Thank you Dr. peterson. Ive learned so much from you. Recently put into practice the idea of planning the day I want to have. I just had a wonderful weekend with my husband as a result. He was over the moon happy . I will eagerly await hearing more from you.ü§ó
Life is suffering! We are born already suffering, nonetheless, there is one option get tougher
All hands are equal when all they have to give is equally-equal.
Thanks Prof for sharing ur wisdom!, this aligns to me pretty well at this point of my life.
I suggest that at times, we are all monsters. Example: In January Jordan claimed on ‚ÄúThe Joe Rogan Experience‚Äù podcast that being transgender is a result of a ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù and similar to ‚Äúsatanic ritual abuse,‚Äù and suggested that acceptance of the trans community is a sign that ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs collapsing.‚Äù
i love how you always talk about suffering but you never talk about how suffering is supposed to be apart of our life, suffering is supposed to be a make or break and even if you break you were supposed to break..etc etc time and the world is weird and beautiful, so glad i found you when i did what a great humble and generous man you are jordan my friend, i know how emotionally connected you are to your work so thank you kind sir
Thank you Dr Peterson; our modern philosopherüôè

Psychedelic Science | Dr. Dennis McKenna | EP 299,"Dr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Dennis McKenna discuss the science behind psychedelics, the entities found through the looking glass, the current pharmaceutical approach to long life, and why it needs to change.

Dr. Dennis McKenna is an American ethnopharmacologist, lecturer and author. He is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit exploring the therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines. McKenna received his masters in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979, followed by his doctorate in the same field at the University of British Columbia in 1984. Dennis is the brother of Terrence McKenna, a cultural figure and proponent for the exploration of psychedelics. Together they co-authored The Invisible Landscape. Much later McKenna would write a memoir, Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss,  detailing he and his brothers exploits in the field. Today, Dennis tours and lectures, while also running the  McKenna Academy of Natural Philosophy, which seeks to uncover the mysteries of consciousness held within the realm of botany and pharmacology.

A very enjoyable conversation.
DMT is used so the plants can take you somewhere and show and teach you. So why if the Shamans tell you that the plants told them how to make or mix DMT is it so unbelievable and it has to be hit and miss - or lucky. Perhaps there is another plant they were using and under its influence THEY were told to mix the two types for DMT. So the plants did tell them which plants. <br>Western science has to force on us that only they KNOW how to do stuff and these idiot backward cultures just got lucky. <br>The plants told them - means the plants told them. I can accept that. <br>TOLD doesn‚Äôt mean talking plants it means when taking a plant a trip message told them.
Something about these traditional media style ads injected throughout Jordan‚Äôs videos kinda cheapens the flow
Jordan. I love you - AND - you won&#39;t have any meaningful contributions to this conversation until you&#39;ve had a couple of significant psychedelic experiences. LSD and mushrooms, at the very least. Please. You know all of the very best people. Let them guide you. Return and report. üôèüèª‚ù§
Psilocybin and Ayahuasca saved my life. I haven‚Äôt used either in many years, but they where absolutely positive and transformative for me. Great to see these rational, intelligent conversations becoming more common.
Once when I was on acid I laid down in the grass and looked up at the night sky... So much movement. Everything was so clear, I could hear the universe and visually see it too. Was mind blowing.
üëÄ @psychedtripx they&#39;ve¬† üçÑüçÅ n more üõ≥üåê‚úÖ
I&#39;m hoping by doing mushrooms I&#39;ll be more organized.üòä
The question was at a point where they said does the mathematic proof the entity gives you end up useful&#39; well in magick when testing entities they for instance have a name later which you may compute the gematria to determine if this was of the nature you intended to evoke, I think it applies to other uses too, all is unity already kind of poked at thr major issue in the endless digressions of philosophy for millenia. God is playing all roles, thst is The Fool, but inbcertain planes the level of consciousness of thst God unit tends to aggregate with others of the same level of consciousness in groups. That&#39;s not to say that there are communications from beings or rather BEING NESS thst reaches beyond its own density to influence the density.
The dr&quot;s hands explained what his mouth could not. Very intune individual LOL. We can learn alot from him.  Seriously tho.  Have a wonderful life everyone and cherish people like this who grace your senses :)
I need guidance I can do 400-500 ugs of Lucy and 3-5 of shrooms and don‚Äôt get visuals a higher dose just makes me more disoriented and voices in my head non stop, where do i order from?
Encountering Themtities
We are basically monkeys with machine guns. They still have not found the missing link to apes. Our brains are capable of rendering a very convincing world when we dream. The fact that so many people are apparently tripping balls these days explains a lot a lot about our so calleed &#39;leaders&#39; these days.
I have tried psilocybin. Twice I felt as if I met &quot;God&quot; or a Supreme being of some kind. It was very much a divine experience and it felt extremely real. Like a revelation.
Serious question:<br>Why would someone migrate to Canada from the U.S.?
Or, they are individual beings, have names and personalities, and are fully alive in the next up dimension or 2nd heaven if you will. This physical body holds a person in a shell, or space suit until the total failure of said suit. Like a chick in an egg. It pounds its head against the wall of its confinement until one day it breaks through into the real world. There are ways which you discuss, to break through.The science of  these things, are known by them, the watchers and other spiritual beings. The Vatican has giant penal glands at its entrance, they know too. The bible says dont experiment in these things and seems to indicate a misuse of pharmacia,    Great discussion, try not to break your space suit prematurely,   LOL
I would like to challenge the notion that &quot;The brain is obviously an organ that can produce personalities. Because, it produces our personalities.&quot; This is a subject I&#39;ve often meditated upon, for the sake of my own personal mission. I&#39;m going to bring forth a bunch of questions and statements which is designed to lead you down a particular train of thought, necessitated due to the one sided dialogue.<br><br>I would like to suggest that personalities, are simply archetypes. Like those Carl Jung proposed, I am not familiar with every archetype, but I&#39;m under the impression that there is limitless varieties. I would like to suggest that if the brain had one individual primary summation for existence, that would be to collect information and transmute it. I would like to suggest that based upon recent evidence with quantum physics, we are multi-dimensional beings. I would like to suggest that we have the capability of experiencing every dimension, regardless of our brain with the evidence from astral projection and remote-viewing which is well documented.<br><br>I would like to try playing around with words now. I believe the brain to be a tuning organ of some fashion, which is always set to &quot;On.&quot; The brain is automatically tuned to what is deemed as the singular most important task. I would like to suggest that our personality is the brain&#39;s default vibration that it is tuned to. In cases with multiple-personality disorder, this could be explained as the brain is flipping impulsively between chosen archetypes that were deemed necessary for the survival of the individual. This could also explain the animalistic tendencies when in such a state.<br><br>I would like to ultimately suggest that the brain, when left to its own devices, will &quot;choose your fate.&quot; It might be possible that I&#39;m confusing ego and brain here, but I really do believe the brain is a response organ primarily, and has the capabilities to tune as well. Think about how much the brain is wired to receive, and how we can be overloaded with information. Think about how subtle your intuition can be when it comes in, yet powerful enough to completely transform you.<br><br>Think about how telepathy is becoming documented, and how people are learning to see their physical environment with their pineal glands. They are tuning, and it seems more difficult because it truly is. We&#39;re wired to receive primarily, and tune into a very, narrow, specific frequency. It may seem woo-woo or mystical, but once the magic can be explained, it&#39;s just science.
The physic quantum have change all the way then the physiciens think about reallity.
One critical component of this discussion was missed in apprehending exorcism.  I would imagine that it is in conflict with a collective unconscious conceptual entities and would really like to hear what both could add to this
I know of a Doctor in BC who was having success treating opioid addiction with Hypnotism and MDMA (ecstasy‚Äî which by the way was developed by Merck and used in the 70s for counseling, but then became illegal for some reason, then a street drug).<br>He was censored by the College of Physicians‚Äî They are HYPOCRITES‚Äî they would rather give addicts Hydromorphone ‚Äúsafe supply‚Äù then let a Doctor treat them and get them off drugs.<br>No wonder there are so many homeless and drug addicts in BC especially.
Dennis says reality is a dillusion and yet we can&#39;t trust entities to be real either. Where does that leave us?
Rick Simpson oil which is marijuana is what I used to detox of opioids. It also worked for my friend to detox of fentanyl &amp; ex wife used it to detox of alcohol 4 times. It‚Äôs a safe alternative to pharmaceutical crap and there is no withdrawal when you stop at least for me it was
With respect to how the amazonians figured out the mixing of Ayahuasca and chacruna to make a brew that one can ingest to trip out, I have a testimony. I visited the Peruvian jungle about 15 years ago to spend some time with a Shaman from the Shapibo tribe, and I was told that long ago, a Jaguar told them the secret. In fact, Jaguars eat Ayahuasca Vine regularly, i was told...

When you&#39;ve experienced psilocybin, the visions, the feeling that others feel, become really relatable and real. But when you haven&#39;t, it could sound very weird and wrong.

Who domesticated who?  Maybe the plants see us as low-hanging fruit, as it were - &quot;here, have another - loser.&quot;
The need to &#39;give in&#39; to the psychedelic experience - the act of &#39;letting go&#39; - must surely be mirrored in the &#39;act&#39; of dying, at least in the case of peaceful deaths
it&#39;s at least 10 years i want to try psilocybin, i am so much curious to see what would happen with my brain
Psilocybin saved me from years of uncontrollable depression, anxiety and illicit pill addiction.  Imagine carrying heavy chains for over a decade and then all of a sudden that burden is gone.  Believe it or not in a couple years the be all over for treatment of mental health related issues.
Microdosing Psilocybin has saved my life. <br><br>10 time combat veteran and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be here without it
Psychedelics are the demonic tools to opening the human mind to demonic attack. PERIOD<br>God is real and satan&#39;s demons are <b>real</b> . <br>Demons always evade giving you the direct answer and just like they said in the trip &quot;they don&#39;t care What you think&quot;.
Ahyuhuasca is the demonic counterfeit to the christian experience people are able to have at a revival or when receiving the Holy Spirit and people falling out the main difference is with God&#39;s experpience your safe and get taken up that jacob&#39;s ladder of higher grasping of God&#39;s presence with the after effect of being refreshed and rejuvenated. <br>Ahyuhuasca is always going to have that risk of a bad/dark trip showing you the evil face of the demonic that terrorizes the person with NO positive fulfillment after. The demonic side wether its drugs or astral projection ALWAYS leaves you feeling dirty and assaulted. God doesn&#39;t do that.
I cherish Jordan, truly. To speak with such varied guests, truly priceless. Get where you can get
I love the McKenna brothers. Rip to the late Terrence.
I had a vision of kalideoscopic, wildly jubilant entities which were engaged in the ever-changing and unending praises of Almighty God. I would call them angels but they did not have discernable wings and were dynamically integrated, even tesselated into the fabric of space/time. I would really like to see them again. I remember thinking, if this is heaven, people are sure going to be surprised. I wasn&#39;t doing any drug other than a little hemp oil to help me sleep but I don&#39;t think I was either asleep or dreaming.
Thanks! Excellent discussion.
these foos are high on mushrooms
Mushrooms changed my life <br>Made the world a lot bigger &amp; a lot more profound

Top level mental gymnastics are needed to square McKenna (the legacy) with JP.  TBH they probably both realize its not in their financial interests to upset the communities
I can show you things that would blow your fucking minds making the impossible actually possible
English guy here. ‚ÄúBeautiful location in Yorkshire‚Ä¶ ahhhh Dorset I guess it was.‚Äù Hahaha ü§£ the absolute other end of the country. Our island is so tiny for these North Americans.
I will say from personal experience that having too great an understanding of what is happening in the brain during a psychedelic trip is detrimental to its positive effects. I dove deep into learning about brain chemistry and the function of the brain and it spoiled any kind of mystical experience that may have come with doing mushrooms. It still provided a lot of good insights and helped me change my priorities a bit but I think I robbed it of being anything like a religious experience by over analyzing the drug.
It seems to me that taking the scientific point of view on this topic won‚Äôt get you anywhere. It may be my arrogance but why do we constantly use the tool of science to go<br>Over spiritual systems &amp; concepts. <br><br><br>P.S I hope all you beautiful people have a good day üëãüèæüëãüèæ
All the shamans I asked told me the spirits told their ancestors to mix the plants. It was an instruction of the forest to help raise comunity consciousness. In these altered states of consciousness, wich for a Ocidental pov is absurd, is pretty much normal to the forest natives. To live in a sensitive way of life interconnected and getting instrunctions from superior vegetal realms of existence. Just be opened for the unknown. Nice talk btw.
People will look back on the past hundred fifty years or so as the second dark age. We are just beginning to awaken again.

Jordy is way too angry about this. Also, what child has had surgery? Ill wait
Thank you, Dr. Peterson. This leftist cesspool agenda is dangerous and it&#39;s unbelievable how many dumb sheep there are,  allowing themselves to be overcome and drawn in by it, regardless of the cost that is so obvious. Our world is in crisis because of the &quot;do whatever you want&quot; individualist mentality.

So the sports industry are liable for all the kids who have dreams of stardom without the talent or ability to  realize that stardom and neglect classroom studies and wind up with lifelong injuries, ruining there life.
JP made owned this dude üòÇ
&quot;Do no harm.&quot;  Criminal physician is correct.
Kyle identifies as a lesbian softball coach
Kyle is a sheep that loves to virtue signal to his homies... His lack of logical argument is stunning and shows the vast difference in intelligence between him and Peterson.
This debate helped illuminate what is in the news. I am better able now to understand this issue.
Any person who feels like they are the opposite gender from what their chromosomes designate is extremely dissociated. Dissociation always points back to emotional trauma.
No healthcare provider should be normalizing mental disorders as if they aren&#39;t mental disorders.
Yea
Tanks, Dr Jordan, for speaking  the truth üëè
Whatever floats your boat?  You&#39;re not really qualified to have an intellectual conversation with Peterson.
Did y&#39;all notice how the topic has subtly digressed to &quot;trans&quot; from &quot;homosexuality&quot;?<br><br>Homosexuality was the perversion that began all this mess but we are slowly evolving to damn trans and approved homosexuality. BE WARNEDüëÜ
Kyles a mega nerd can‚Äôt watch
Kyle is only happy to have &#39;Govt&#39; regulate social media. Why ? Because 99.99999% of Govt is liberal hacks.  I wonder if Kyle would  want Govt to regulate social media if he saw lots of MAGA caps in govt ?  Methinks not.
It is truly preposterous to suggest someone can be ‚Äúborn in the wrong body‚Äú. (What happened to body positivity, by the way?)<br><br>To accept the assertion that a person can be born in the wrong body is to accept a claim that our true selves are non-corporeal entities, divorced from our animal bodies. The material reality of biological existence is dismissed in favor of an identity which is functionally indistinguishable from the concept of a soul. This is ideological capture of atheism by a contemporary orthodoxy that is just as dogmatic, and just as incoherent as any kooky religious doctrine. I would challenge Kyle, @Breaking Points, and fellow atheists to remember the Sagan Standard.
Kyle, you could win a debate with Jordan with his whacky religious views but on this subject, you need to step out of ur biases and think what Jordan is trying to say about influencers on adolescents children.
Jordan runs circles around this clown
No they do promote they are not all born in the wrong body in their mind they are but gen. they are men and women . Now they are very little trans from the other groups . Adults can do what they want but under the age of puberty hell to the no jail the parents .
Great job by Kyle exposing Peterson as blatantly anti-freedom. They don&#39;t care about the kids, they just use it as an excuse to push their shitty agenda.
No, its not similar to the gay community. Look up Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria and WHY its happening in adolescent females (hint, it has lots to do with SOCIAL MEDIA and popular culture). Its literally a SOCIAL CONTAGION.
Expand first Amendment until they say something he doesnt like. This guy is a joke.
Do they not understand who is on the other end of the mic at this point.... The bullshit argument of &quot;food costs are already high as shit, so pay the fast food workers double their current wage to catch up&quot;
Kyle arguing with Jordan is amusing. Kyle is not even close to the intelligence, education of Jordan. Jordan destroyed him
I wonder what Kyle thinks today? Less than a year later.
Jordan is way above you bud. Nice try
Who hates the rainbow?
Your husband is a tool over 40 who waited till he was over 38 to wear an earing and frost his hair.... Kyle Cucklinski
Peterson has some points, but doesn‚Äôt look good overall in this one
Does the doctors still take an oath to do know harm?
I&#39;m confused, Does Jordan not support free speech because of possible social contagion?
Still don‚Äôt get the hero worshipping of JP. He‚Äôs so pompous and acts like he has the moral authority over all things. Insufferable yet people adore him. SMH.
This guest asks questions then doesn‚Äôt let the host answer. Then he doesn‚Äôt answer questions but instead asks more questions. Then plays the what does X mean? Exasperating.
He has no idea what he&#39;s talking about, sometimes people on the left argue just for the sake of arguingü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
No, mentally ill adults DO NOT have the right to self mutilate, nor do they have the right to indoctrinate children to do-so.<br>If it was &#39;suppressed&#39;, why are 99.99% of the &#39;enlightened&#39; ones UNDER 20, and MALE? What a ridiculous statement; where are all the the 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 past &#39;suppressed&#39; people?
No-one &#39;debates&#39; Jordan, they listen, and learn.
I have dysphoria and believe that my healthy left arm does not belong in my body. Should I have the right to go to the doctor for removal and can the doctor remove my healthy left arm?
If the trans people say a penis dosent make you a man then why would a women who  says she identifies as a man want one? If clothing dosent define your gender then why dress ‚Äúlike a man‚Äù?
What a typical dumbass Lefty. How does he know that the individual who claims to have transitioned was telling the truth? He doesn&#39;t. Leftys just believe what they want to believe about everything, even when the &quot;evidence&quot; is silly and anecdotal.
Numbskull. It is a right to believe that adults do NOT have a right to do intrisically evil things to themselves. Right and wrong are not subjective. Most people figure this out by the age of three. Lefties never figure this out.
I almost always am disappointed in Kyle. He seems flippant and unprepared. Today he was ready, patient and asked great questions. I think he was actually better prepared than JP!
The issue about the transition is that it doesn‚Äôt just end with the surgery. It requires the rest of society to state a lie.
This isn‚Äôt a debate at all. This is Kyle just stating that he doesn‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs actually anything too terrible happening. When Peterson says what about this and that Kyle says I take no stance on that. Then why the fuck are you ‚Äúdebating‚Äù about it? You really wasted Jordan Petersons time just to solely say ‚Äúhey shouldn‚Äôt grown ups be able to do literally whatever they want to themselves?‚Äù <br><br>No. Next question.
Jordan Petersen is so bad at this, he just looks like an idiot in every debate i see him appear in.
There as as many intersexed people as there are red heads.  Sorry just not on the Christian nationalist side here.  It brought us a failed nation in virtually every metric there is.  Now if you dont know what intersexed is, then don&#39;t reply because the reply is meaningless.",PT12M28S
Jordan Peterson Gets Emotional Talking About Olivia Wilde's 'Incel' Comparison,"Clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan B. Peterson joined Piers Morgan Uncensored for a discussion on a variety of topics. In this segment, Jordan is questioned by Piers on some recent comments from actress and director Olivia Wilde, who said one of the characters in her latest film 'Don't Worry Darling' was based on ""this insane man called Jordan Peterson, a pseudo-intellectual hero for the incel community"". Peterson gives an emotional response to this comparison and criticism, suggesting he thought the marginalised were ""meant to have a voice"".

The ease with which Jordan Peterson is being judged by the likes of mrs. Wilde is a very sad thing indeed.
I love him
This is what a good man looks like. Olivia Wilde? Haha a great picture of garbage.
lmfao what a joke

I mean it‚Äôs Olivia Wilde does anyone really take her seriously?
Awww, he needs to hear that he&#39;s special. Nobody deserves anything. Selfless service is the only mission.
Growing up it took me years to understand what my peers meant when they said that the world can be a cruel place and at first I thought they meant just the environment, whether, climate change, plants dying, crazy people, things that we can‚Äôt control anyways but I realized it‚Äôs not those things it‚Äôs the people that can make life not worth living anymore it‚Äôs the people that drives other people to be crazy.
Keep up the good work Jordan, have faith, equality has been an issue for a very long time. I&#39;m happily married and love my wife more than I ever have, we are a team. 50-50all the way.<br>We live on a small sailing boat and we each have our own duties.<br>We both work hard in equal amounts.<br>We have blue jobs and pink jobs.<br>Its works for us.<br>Keep up the good work we are both behind you.

Great acting, 10/10
Empathy in abundance, a modern hero.üëç
This Olivia Wilde gives me Amber Heard vibes.
You can tell he felt disappointed and insulted for his work to be looked down. He‚Äôs crying for the pain of men that are bullied by the society and they feel lost.
And who else is going to give these people a voice. He is a great role model.
I wonder if he ever cried like this after reading another piece of news about a woman being assaulted and killed by a man?
A real man is always attacked for doing the right thing.
He acts like a jackass and once he get&#39;s called out, acts like he was doing it for others
Pure sincerity
Is weird cause lefties often brag about their empaty, but this guy has more empathy than all of them.
The solution is not &quot;enforced monogamy&quot; as Jordan Peterson said in Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast. It is the legalization of brothels, because unlike women, men&#39;s right has not become modernized. The governments have provided all women&#39;s needs systematically through governmental institutions, including the need for protection. They employ a group of men to do so, and we know if they lack personnel they will make it mandatory as it was in the past and still in some countries to go to military service, only for men. But as for a man&#39;s sexual needs the governments have not only not created a governmental insitution for it but also prohibitted the private institution for it which is a brothel. In fact, they have left man&#39;s most important need to the personal relationship and in the hands of women, so they have given women an atomic bomb level of bargaining power over men. Men have been stripped of their traditional rights but are still subject to traditional duties to women. The solution is not going back to tradition as Peterson and Andrew Tate say, it is modernizing men&#39;s right too, which is the legalization of the public provision of their most important need which is sex, just like the public provision of all women&#39;s need. This will reduce human trafficking too, because once an activity goes underground it will connect to other underground activities. Unoffical prostitution will go down too, female students overseas, Erasmus, we all know what they do. So trafficked and unofficial prostitution will lose its clients to the registered monitored protected insured healthy prostitution. There is another Justification too, there must be a P added to lgbtq, so it will be lgbtqp, P is the sexual minority that do not believe in the old school provision of sexual needs and believe in the exchange of money for sex, they have a right to excercise their belief. Governmental actions and laws must be separated from religion which is secularism, but we need another separation between state and any other ideology, at the top of them feminism which is enemy number one of prostitution. They say we are humiliated because some women do that, it is not their business what a group of women want to do. So did women fight all these decades for the liberty and empowerment, only to use it against the liberty and empowerment of a group of themselves which are prostitutes? They want men to suffer from lack of sex and be feminized, become gay or trans and the very same feminist will support you, but as long as you want to be a straight man, they are your enemy and want to destroy your masculinity, because feminists have penis envy, and male feminists are full of estrogen and envy your sexual performance as a madculine man. We are speaking about what governments must so, It is not governments job to consult men on how to get women, governments must offer material solutions, people can choose what service too use personally! Yes personally! Based on their beliefs, religion, ideology, and feminist must do the same and get their damn ideology out of governments and our lives !! Please share this passage and promote it, I want a clear answer from all these prophets of capitalism, such as Peterson and Andrew Tate, who just like the motivational speakers always put the blame on people and say you do not have because you are not enough. Peterson wants his traditional image intact so he does not speak about legalization of prostitution, he is speaking on behalf of the judeochristian culture and the moment one speaks on behalf of a culture or religion they are separate from science so he is not the voice of science. Andrew Tate is unknowingly serving the very same system he is opposed to by promoting the law of jungle, saying become rich like me through online charlatansim to get girls, so did the law of jungle work for him when they put him in jail based on imaginary charges? He depicts men who study or work REAL jobs as losers who were not smart enough like him to become a charlatan dealer/trader. These men do the real jobs that the world will not function without. A high value man is a man who adds value to this world through his job, so a firefighter is more high value than all these cowards like Andrew Tate and Myron Gaines who became rich through the legal gaps the unjust economic system has allowed them to abuse, and they show off their illegitmate wealth to gain more from online platforms. Circulate this passage if you are a man and have had enough of this show of war between feminists and fake masculine figures such as Peterson and Tate! It is all about media money!

JBP is the only person shedding a damn tear for people like me, who grew up mostly without a father, with a tyrannical mother, and no real guidance except from movies and television - and the damn state. When you grow up in a soft cage, where everything is fine as long as you keep to yourself and don&#39;t cause too much trouble, it&#39;s incredibly demoralizing. I&#39;m thirty-two and I still feel completely ill-equipped for the world I inhabit. I&#39;ve travelled, I&#39;ve lived, I&#39;ve loved, I&#39;ve worked - and still I feel like the dregs of society. Like my contributions are paltry, and trying to do more would only end in disaster for me and others.<br><br>I constantly wrestle with whether I have a right to feel the way I do. I struggle with how to improve my situation, when decades of conditioning tells me to just keep my head down and that most fights just aren&#39;t worth the trouble.<br><br>I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling this way. Most of us just try to power through. But it&#39;s hard listening to people with big megaphones speak about &quot;us&quot; as if we&#39;re troglodytes or something. Almost as if we&#39;re subhuman and that the world would be a tidier, nicer place without us. I&#39;m not a so-called &quot;incel&quot;, but I find common cause with them regardless: seems we&#39;re all on the chopping block, regardless of our &quot;body count&quot;. Average to lower-class men have few allies it seems, and a great deal of enemies without a single shot being fired.
A lot of us see him as a role-model, many others would like to see him dead because he&#39;s a blockade against their toxic ideology...<br>But we often forget that this man has spent the most part of it&#39;s life diving into people&#39;s worst trauma in order to pull them out of it. He&#39;s stared at misery, despair, hopelesness... for his entire career, watch people so messed up inside that even staying alive was a challenge for them.<br><br>So, when a dumb bitch picks these emotionally wounded people and turns them into some sort of &quot;entertainement&quot; just for the buzz of it... I can&#39;t even imagine the feelings that passed through him when he learned of that.
I don&#39;t let dumb whores bother me.
Piers at his best , instead of shouting people down. Perhaps because he was confronted with a force for good and a  supreme intellect

People have often wondered what disaffected people have fallen through the cracks, how many Einstein&#39;s died in Africa starving. And the same principle applies to ever single corner of the Earth. Especially to the corner who suffers the most from criticism. You throw scorn on anyone, for some societal reason, but they may be the next Nikola Tesla, or Benjamin Franklin. Our &quot;celebrities&quot; these days can&#39;t hold a candle to the geniuses of the past

Didn&#39;t she marry 2 of them.
He gets emptional too much. Which leads me to belive he cares too much what people think about him.
Olivia Wilde is nothing more than a angry bitter man hating feminist, I could careless what she says.  Apparently she never got over men not giving up their seat on the bus back when she was pregnant.  Probably taking out her bitter hatred of men on Jason Sudeikis and the same reason why he had her served on stage during Cinemacon.  If you happen to be petty and hateful that energy comes back to you three fold.
We love u Jordan..stand up for all of us‚Ä¶
Olivia üòÇ <br>Just her name alone tells you she‚Äôs a silver spoon kid who wouldn‚Äôt last a day in the real world
&quot;I thought the marginalized were supposed to have a voice&quot;. Fully exposes the utter hypocrisy of the woke left. They don&#39;t care about the marginalized. They care about their own moral degeneracy and not having to be accountable for their heinous actions.
160,000 for a bachelors.. plus living expenses... man thats just crazy.... start your life off with a huge debt.   here in Finland the education is free if you are from here or a resident. you pay or get a loan for living expenses usually.. under 9 thousand euros total..... Good Luck Jordan, I hope this dream comes true. you will change things for the better
I&#39;m super curious as to exactly what Jordan Peterson has ever said that was so offensive to these groups of people? I don&#39;t consider him to be a particularly controversial figure whatsoever. What&#39;s the most controversial thing he&#39;s ever said? That he doesn&#39;t think that government should be able to legislate what words can come out of a person&#39;s mouth? As Jordan has previously said &#39;In order to think, you have to risk being offensive&#39; as a female interviewer from the BBC took no issue with risking offending Jordan Peterson as she poked and prodded to get answers from him from some very hard edged questions. That&#39;s not him saying that a person should go be racist, sexist, derogatory, etc to a person, which he has explicitly clarified. So again, what has he said or done that is so controversial, in order for people like Olivia Wilde to apparently take such great issue with? Jordan isn&#39;t homophobic, he&#39;s isn&#39;t transphobic. What&#39;s the issue?",PT6M57S

Jordan Peterson is wrong about everything, starting with his idea of &quot;woke&quot;.  Journalists do not &quot;blindside&#39;, they ask probing questions
I am glad my mom isn&#39;t with my dad anymore he was always cheating on my mom with her best friend and he wouldn&#39;t have been tolerant of my brother being gay as my mom would say. However without a dad it was hard for me to understand boys and men my mom&#39;s view was very bias and limited and all she would say is they only want one thing. I wish I had a dad so I know it&#39;s okay to need help and not feel ashamed. I had a step dad who taught me how to fish and camp, but he was also a pedo, I have an uncle who helped raise me, but also had me move out and promised me I could come back later and never kept that promise. so really there isn&#39;t a man in this world I trust to not deeply hurt me , not even my boyfriend of 7 years because I&#39;ll always ask what do they really want, am I gonna be enough. I can say that having this mentality isn&#39;t something I would give back because it keeps me aware and I didn&#39;t have to learn how men could be in the long run so I didn&#39;t have sex as a teenager, I didn&#39;t date, I refused to be a teenager with multiple baby daddy&#39;s . For a relationship I didn&#39;t even have my first one til 7 years ago and still counting. I never thought I&#39;d actually end up with anyone, much less someone who enjoys not being on his phone for social media ‚ù§. I guess I got lucky, but it&#39;s sad to know things could have been different, I could have learned to trust men better.
As someone who grew up an only child, I can tell you it is a curse, especially after my parents divorced and my father had little to do with me during that time. I spent way too much time alone growing up not being able socialize with other children and that followed well into my adult years. I am sure it held me back professionally too.
Awful editing, my god.
He whiffed it on her birthrate question.  The reason that the birthrate in Scandinavia is relevant is that an economically unsustainably low birth rate could result in result in state-sponsored childcare appearing to be affordable.  The economic question we must ask is how much it costs to provide childcare at an approximate replacement birthrate.  I don&#39;t know if Scandinavia&#39;s childcare scales or doesn&#39;t but that&#39;s the answer to her question.
Jordan, the federal liberal government, gives money to patents for daycare. My concern is that Justin Trudeau&#39;s governmet has spent too much money, and Canada is deeply in debt, making Canadians ultimately at the mercy of the lenders. Comparing Canada to any European country is unrealistic. Canada has infrastructure expenses that far outweigh the expenses of European countries. We have a much smaller tax base in view of the aforementioned. I agree 100% that siblings help to socialize one another especially if the parents take them places on vacation where they only have one another to play with. Our four sons are best friends after 30+ years from age 20 on into adulthood. They have each other&#39;s backs through thick and thin. Certainly they fought, but when the chips are down, they support one another. Vacations need not  expensive. We went camping.
I have had my son for his whole life it&#39;s not as hard as they say
She is not &quot;speechless!&quot; Another clickbait title is why I won&#39;t subscribe to your channel. Good bye...
JP is the man, if the world had more men like him we certainly would be better off.
Huh? Does he have any studies to back this up?
Growing up without a father has always had its psychological effect on kids and this has been known for decades. Why are humans acting like it doesn&#39;t matter now? Why are humans playing along with being stupid?  Idiocracy is here
Man this guy is always spot on
I agree with him, but there are also diferent situations. We should not generalize. I raise my kid alone, not because I choose that but because the husband died. In my country the daily care is free but I chose to send her to a private one. Since she was 1 she goes there and now she is 4. From 9 till 17 o&#39;clock. I&#39;m also working this time. She loves it there, we are almost running on the streets in the morning, she can&#39;t wait to see the kids and the teachers but also we two have a fantastic bond. Was the best decision I made. She is a happy kid according to all the signs of that , that I could read on the internet. We will see if she will be a &quot;broken&quot; adult. I believe that there are situations and situations.
I had no issues looking after my children when they were under 12 months old. Having to travel 3000kms in a car without my wife and with my young son. Had no issues at all. My wife had to work. She could not breastfeed. So no issue to travel with a young baby as a dad. Kids need a dad. Having both parents helps a lot, it gives the kids balance.
It‚Äôs crazy when you ask liberals what countries are run better than the United States they almost always reply Scandinavia‚Ä¶ when we have four states larger than Norway (the largest of their countries) a WAAAAY higher population and they have some of the smallest number of minorities.<br><br>It‚Äôs incomparable
My father died when I was 12 yo,my mother raised us as well as she could,struggling everyday to raise 3 kids ,with only 1 source of income .We grew up poor and with an empty fridge most of the time.But the most impact on our life was the empty space the death of my father left as a guide for us in life and as a model as us going through puberty when a male model is much needed
I found an important thought here, mostly you are raised by your siblings, not your parents. It explains a lot to me,
Is it ok to keep that role going once that year lapse. What would you like to my little unit.
Fathers are really the foundation for a kid to grow up mentally and physically competent, have strong sense of morals and responsibilities.
You‚Äôre stealing from Jorden, he‚Äôs providing all of the content.
I would like to see some references to some of his bullshit claims.
Having spent a lot of time in Holland because of familial factors visiting regularly for ten years, I can say that they are not a happy country and are filled with racism and narcissism. So I have to disagree totally with this woman&#39;s view that they are a happy country.
What‚Äôs worse is having a parent in and out and in and out and in and out of your life. It royally fucks up a kids head.
My kid is 1 year old. Was raised by two fathers. Never had a mother. It went smooth and easy. Healthy happy kid. Men are perfectly equipped to raise babies, it&#39;s not rocket science.
In America, there is an element which demands the &#39;right&#39; of complete self-determination, de novo, and the complete annihilation of traditional norms such as the family unit, and of institutions, such as justice and government, and yet speak nothing of duties and responsibilities as neighbor and citizen, especially if they disagree with your agendas.
JBP is spot on. This just seems so obvious to me. How is it up for debate? The evidence is overwhelming.
the po-mos always have a point.  the nuclear family isn&#39;t the only way, it&#39;s not set in stone, it wasn&#39;t decreed by some overlord<br><br>however, the nuclear family is a &quot;most optimum&quot; model for most of humanity - it&#39;s the simplest unit that adequately minimises the chances of a child having a less ideal start in life.  you could likely raise good kids with different models such as shared parenting in primitive tribes - but there is the trade-off of more complexity from more people being involved (not to mention paternity questions)<br><br>The po-mos great failing is &quot;the perfect is the enemy of the good&quot;.<br><br>Its also patently obvious to me that women are so unhappy with what feminism has pushed them into.  every single girl i know, even the less agreeable more competitive ones is constantly stressed out and complaining about work and crying on their man&#39;s shoulder.  I wish people could just acknowledge this
Is all of this because YOU DONT HAVE A SON?
Someday let&#39;s get MRS JP on one of the spectacles
You should no parent of 1 who has raised a complete natzi child
JP you are so damn RUDE how&#39;s you ONE DAUGHTER doing btw
I have been privileged to provide childcare for my grands...with the full support of my husband.  Hats off to you for meeting this head on...feminist propaganda has made this a tough subject.    Getting married...raising your children in a loving, supportive and grounded family then being there to help your children don&#39;t he same is a generational blessing that no one should apologize for.  Don&#39;t steal that privilege from your children if you have any way to avoid it.<br><br>And remember...nothing will affect your overall ability to thrive and prosper like cutting your wealth in half and sharing your children with a person you despise.  Learn how to work it out...become a person others enjoy living with.  It&#39;s worth the work...its a temporary sacrifice of fleeting personal &quot; happiness&quot; in exchange for great rewards of deep contentment and pride of knowing you cared for others more than yourself.
So let me get this straight - this Leftist lunatic posing as a &quot;journalist&quot;, who I&#39;m sure approves of men defrauding women of their rights by pretending to be women, is going to lecture Jordan Peterson on his views about women? üò≥ The absolute arrogance of these people is JAW DROPPING...
In the times we live in Jordan telling the truth is a revolutionary act
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EkwXncjSos&amp;t=6m48s"">6:48</a> as someone that is an only child I do know and it hurts. Because you don&#39;t have a deep connection, it&#39;s hard for you to form them to be able to communicate. You are desperate to keep you friends and because you spend so much time alone you would rather be with friends however people have lives so when your friends can&#39;t hangout you get depressed and feel your life is worthless. That&#39;s the start of a long list. Being an only child sucks from a mental standpoint
Jordan once again showing that you can prove anything with facts.
A well equipped gentleman.  He cannot be swayed or manipulated.
I wish people would not put sappy music under these clips. Or at least put a link to the original interview in the description.
Hyperbolic video title.
Please don&#39;t glorify Scandinavia. Denmark is a substandard country being driven into the ground by an incompetent, greedy government while the elderly rot away in poor conditions. If we are the happiest in the world, it&#39;s because 10% of the country is on anti-depressants.
spot on
I love how Jordan constantly dismantles the weak thoughtless pathetic arguments of the woke feminist conspiracy to control man........ HOW COME NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ADAM AND EVE WHEN HE LISTENED TO HER AND CAVED TO HER WILL AND ADVICE TO EAT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE???????????????????????????????????? They are not satisfied with ruining Adam&#39;s connection with God and the fall of humanity because of their subtle maniacal obsession with control. God punished women for their power grab whereby they listened to satan instead of God and sababatoged Adams connection with God and caused the fall of mankind. That&#39;s why God said THE MAN has the final say in important life changing decisions! <br>satan constantly works through women who refuse to confess their sins and humble themselves before God!    That&#39;s why you have all these sophisticated subtle attacks on man!
Bruh the clickbait in the title
For jp, as a researcher, it would be better if he cited the actual studies. I dont want to into a discussion armed with references like ‚Äújordan peterson said on youtube‚Äù
Those ‚Äùstudies‚Äù about relative happiness between different countries should be taken with big grain of salt. My country Finland have been ‚Äùthe happiest country in EU‚Äù many times. Still it has top suicide rates. Why?
The DEI department did a great job with this video.
I grew up in a broken home with alcoholic parents, absent father, and abuse.  My father‚Äôs absence sent me spiraling into drugs and alcohol.  I passed all that pain onto the family I created.  Took waking up, getting sober, doing therapy, and putting God at the center to make me find peace.
A minimum birth rate of 1.2 children is not enough sustain a healthy population or an economy.  Many countries are finding that out the hard way, such as China, Russia, Germany, France, South Korea, Japan, and others.  They have an aging population that needs expensive healthcare and not enough young people to make enough money to cover that expense.  And not enough young people to fill the jobs that is required to maintain the current economic level.  She mentioned Scandinavia subsidized childcare, they have to pay very high taxes for that as well as socialized healthcare.",PT8M43S

I was jealous of everyone for years because of my insecurities and weaknesses. But then I made a New Year resolution to end it, because I realized something. I do not believe in society anymore. I say two words to ultimately eliminate the self-doubt that tries to attack me: screw norms. <br><br>I&#39;m 27, still live at home, having <i>never</i> moved out. I have never had a girlfriend or a date, and I don&#39;t even have a driver&#39;s license. I have both a learning disability and ASD, and sometimes I say unfiltered things or act weird in social moments. I assume my ASD makes me &quot;less normal.&quot; I don&#39;t have too many friends now that I&#39;ve graduated from college and most of my friends have left town. My coworkers all seem to fit in; I usually stand out. I used to feel like a misfit at work, but now I realize that it&#39;s not a big deal. It&#39;s just they&#39;re not my people, they&#39;re each other&#39;s only. If my ASD makes them not like me enough, that&#39;s their problem. Sure, I don&#39;t have a great filter, but it doesn&#39;t define me; nobody is perfect. I don&#39;t care if people find me weird or annoying. I don&#39;t care that my both my sisters have boyfriends and started dating at 16 while I&#39;ve always been single. I don&#39;t care that I can&#39;t drive. I don&#39;t care that I appear dopey because of my learning disability. I don&#39;t care that I graduated high school at <i>TWENTY.</i> I don&#39;t care that I seem slow and helpless and do better with a guide than by myself (my boss basically said that to my face). I don&#39;t care that I still live with my mom. I don&#39;t care that I went to a small charter school than the &quot;superior&quot; public school that has many more activities, adventures, and organizations. I don&#39;t care about any of my weaknesses; I still have confidence in myself. It doesn&#39;t matter what others think of me, it&#39;s what I think of myself that matters. I will never fall for society&#39;s tricks again; society is buIIshit, and that would explain our government and political leaders. I say &quot;SCREW NORMS!&quot; I am absolutely fine the way I am, I say confidently. I am not a loser. A disabled man who doesn&#39;t match standards, yes, but not a loser. There is nothing wrong with being different. Different is good. Normal is boring.
His talks not scripted maybe basic. How he can never miss a lick and having all the to my opinion is one of the few most intelligent people ever.
If Jordan could just stick to psychology like in this video, he could be much more influential
I was far too nice, always saying yes, in a job about 5 years ago. When I had a problem at work one time, my boss did not back me. I could not stay much longer after that. They were told exactly what I thought before I walked out on them. Lesson learned for sure ‚ù§
Men make others eunuchs to do gods work
This is amazing!
You know what‚Äôs funny is I genuinely don‚Äôt care what people think. So that‚Äôs not my problem, my problem is what people do because of how they think of me. That leaks into my life. Them judging to the point where they take steps to interfere with my life. That‚Äôs the problem. So now, I‚Äôm forced to care how people think so it doesn‚Äôt effect my life, whether that‚Äôs in the workplace or family because I don‚Äôt want to be gossiped about, to the point where determinations are made about me with management or whatever. I just want to not talk to people, but instead I have to act dumb, ask of things like a kid who feels like they‚Äôre being a burden. Anyone else feel this way? If I stand my ground, it gets worse.
Brilliant
I love this guy! Genius.
Concentrated, unadulterated realness, As tough &amp; painful as it may seem.<br><br>Keep it up JBP, in this age of moral abyss and despair you are no less than a prophet. <br>Thank you
In a world of chaos and weakness and blind sheep Jordan is a bright light that I am thankful for. I share his insights with my kids all the time, and my kids are on both sides of the party line. The truth is true no matter where or when it comes.
Lol I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôve never cared if people like me or not I‚Äôm very confident within myself it‚Äôs like a box of chocolates.

If only I&#39;d heard this 25 years ago. My life would of been much different. Words like these breed ammunition and defence inside of you, to tackle the bullies, the backstabbers and the envious we encounter as soon as we try and make our way in the world as young adults. Stand up straight people! God bless Dr Peterson. ‚úäüíú
Dekh beta wht I will do is 10 lakh admi tumhara tapar maregee daily n 2 i completely destroyed yr life so nvr try to talk to me..
&quot;Take your place in the world as a decent person and a decent citizen&quot;.
Love listening, he&#39;s so smart, so handsome.
Jordan is a very smart man, but he often explains how to take the long route to solving certain personal issues. Everything he‚Äôs trying to solve in this talk (to stop caring what other people think) can be solved by true, deeply rooted self- love and self-acceptance. True self-love is essentially valuing yourself and loving yourself and despite having your insecurities, you decide to accept them as making you unique and special and those insecurities give you strength, empathy and understanding. Laughing at your own flaws and being deeply secure with yourself despite your inevitable flaws, can be the most attractive thing a person can do. Through self- love and acceptance practices and meditation, you can dissolve the ego, which dissolves the inner life narrative that causes a roller coaster of emotions, getting a rush when you feel validated and a rush when you feel ostracized by a group.
If i may, could I know the sorce this video was compiled from?
Encouraging and insightful words.
cut that music. its so pathetic
I rarely care about what people think. I do worry about what they are doing!
I experienced this last night. Needed this video
Especially stop caring about what you think.
Hes brilliant---I like some of his teachings but for someone who doesn&#39;t believe in God he sure uses God&#39;s name in vain. Praying he comes to Christ.
I know a person right now who CRAVES attention. And doesn&#39;t care how he gets is. I just wish he would listen to you ! You Are a God send for me right now. Thank you!
I find it so damn hard to say what I really feel when someone puts me down and then I go home and become resentful. It&#39;s exactly like Dr. Peterson says. I needed to hear this a long time back.
I needed this!
Where is the original video
Be cunning as a snake, with the face of an angel.
I really needed this advice thank
BRILLIANT!!!!
If as small children we get threatened by a big parent, we stay quiet for our own safety. That can stay with us for a long time.
You, Jordan, always bring up hypothetical scenarios where the &quot;you person&quot; is male...example, you speak of &quot;your wife,&quot; etc. I wouldn&#39;t object or feel confused if you said &quot;your husband,&quot; etc. Of course, one can imagine nowadays day that that scenario involves a lesbian couple. Yet somehow, I don&#39;t believe you meant it that way.

If Peterson ran for office he would have a restricted voice. He is free to speak the truth and offend people, and that is more important.<br>If they invested all the money they paid healthy people to stay home into health care, and just paid sick people to stay home, they could have an excellent health care system, and the economy wouldn&#39;t have been ruined.
Is it just me that can‚Äôt stand the little guy
Has been quite some time since I‚Äôve listened to Dr. Peterson. And, I still love Jordan. He is authentic, interesting, and I believe - a good man who cares about the well-being of others, society, culture, Family and,  our God given World &amp; All Good Things; and he cares about Doing The Best he can. He‚Äôd be a wonderful man to have a conversation with. (imo)

The xan man is not to be trusted
The problem I have with JBP is that, you listen to one podcast with him, you&#39;ve listened to a dozen. It&#39;s phrases that he has established that sometime remind you, but it&#39;s also a reminder that are are not listening to nothing new. It&#39;s nice to hear some new ideas but they compare very poorly in significance to the main ideas of his. It&#39;s not a critique of JBP, just an observation I&#39;ve made throughout the years.
&quot;Trump&quot; !!! LOL
History of the unconscious book - must read
I really enjoy to listen to mr Peterson, as a European I really don‚Äôt see the whole controversy. He comes of as a levelheaded and honest man that doesn‚Äôt hide behind anything or anyone.
Talkinh about wearing a suit is nonsense.  Grow up.   Content of character!
freaking great got all the best suits on the boys-
He&#39;s almost more interesting than Andrew. Certainly more relatable
I&#39;ve noticed that Dr. Peterson and Andrew Tate have many similar ideas. Specifically their beliefs about strong men. A man who is capable of dangerous things, but is stoic is stronger than a soft man who is not capable of dangerous things.
Damn Patrick wouldn‚Äôt let Jordan finish some of his statements lol üòÖ<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvLU2Dq3HN8&amp;t=41m20s"">41:20</a>
Oh ya it‚Äôs fine. God bless. Congrats Merc
The greatest thinker of our time.
Still so relevant today
People dress down because it&#39;s more comfortable. People don&#39;t dress down because they want to look like a ten-year-old that&#39;s your analogy. To each its own
why is Jordan peterson backround full of a wall of safe boxes? can somebody explain.
This was sooooo boring! Who cares about his damn suits?????
JP is such a fairy.
The most important thing that should be on everyone&#39;s mind currently should be to invest in different sources of income that doesn&#39;t depend on the government. Especially with the current economic crisis around the word. This is still a good time to invest in various stocks, Gold, silver and digital currencies.
This thumbnail screams ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre all dickheads‚Äù
He has his limits. To much of a hard thinker. not capable to reach a bigger audience as a leader.
This interview was more interesting <a href=""https://youtu.be/poVMWHS31oA"">https://youtu.be/poVMWHS31oA</a>
At a restaurant I worked at I saw a chef on his day off with his kids. He looked like he was wearing overgrown versions of their clothes, so I asked him if he had got into a fight a fight with the machine from the movie BIG with Tom Hanks
Genious lol
Jordon Peterson absolutely changed the world , my world as well. Geious. I.Q. 160+
Great podcast!!
Love your podcast!
Jordan Peterson my favorite speaker, knows how it works and love his look on everyday things, from important to less important<br>And he was this close to death, then his brain told him, I have to stop with the medicine, cause thats killing me, and not helping in solve my depression, from that moment on, he recovered, glad that he didn&#39;t pass away
I hate the mediocrity of the ‚Äúdress down‚Äù culture. I was a sales rep for a very large manufacturer and I was complimented EVERY single time
N‚Äôkay
This is confusing you‚Äôre talking about Biden shutting the country down but he wasn‚Äôt the one that did it remember? Biden and trump are both pitiful, excuses for leaders.
Love listening to Jordan. He‚Äôs so smart,kind and humble .
Men in suits have destroyed the west <br><br>Fact
People want to work from home because...<br>.<br><br>1. Zero work drama<br>2. Save money and time on commutes each day. Save on wear and tear on cars. <br><br>3. More productive and not javing your time wasted on unnecessary stuff.
Would be great for humanity if someone locked the 3 of them I. That bank vault so no one has to hear the bull shit that comes out of there mouths
Jordan is a genius with the exception of his take on the election not being stolen.
So sick of this damn podcast always &quot;up next&quot; so retarded. I&#39;ll continue to thumbs down it every time it autoplays.
Okooo",PT2H37M49S
